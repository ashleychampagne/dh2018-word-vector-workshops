    "To train our vectors we call this function below. This function has a couple dozen parameters, some of which are more important than others.\n",
    "We will explain a few major parameters here. The fields that are MANDATORY are marked with an asterisk:\n",
    "1. `sentences*`: This is where you provide your data. It must be in a format of iterable of iterables.\n",
    "2. `sg`: Your choice of training algorithm. There are two standard ways of training W2V vectors -- 'skipgram' and 'CBOW'. If you enter 1 here the skip-gram is applied; otherwise, the default is CBOW.\n",
    "3. `size*`: This is the length of your resulting word vectors. If you have a large corpus (>1 billion tokens) you can go up to 100-300 dimensions. Generally word vectors with more dimensions give better results.\n",
    "4. `window`: This is the window of context words you are training on. In other words, how many words come before and after your given word. A good number is 50 here but this can vary depending on what you are interested in. For instance, if you are more interested in embeddings that embody semantic meaning, smaller window sizes work better. \n",
    "5. `alpha`: The learning rate of your model. If you are interested in machine learning experimentation with your vectors you may experiment with this parameter.\n",
    "6. `seed` (int): This is the random seed for your random initialization. All deep learning models initialize the weights with random floats before training. This is a useful field if you want to replicate your experiments because giving this a seed will initialize 'randomly' deterministically.\n",
    "7. `min_count`: This is the minimum frequency threshold. If a given word appears with lower frequency than provided it will be ignored. This is here because words with very low frequency are hard to train.\n",
    "8. `iter`: This is the number of iterations(entire run) over the corpus, also known as epochs. Usually anything between 1-10 is ok. The trade offs are that if you have higher iterations, it will take longer to train and the model may overfit on your dataset. However, longer training will allow your vectors to perform better on tasks relevant to your dataset.\n",

    "Overall, most of these settings wil not concern you unless you are interested in very specific usages of word vectors."
