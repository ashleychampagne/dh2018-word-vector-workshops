        "Noticed something missing? Take a look at the parameter [`token_pattern` of `CountVectorizer()`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html). The way a chunk of text is divided up in sentences and then in words is dependant upon our definitions of sentence and word boundaries. The process of splitting a text in words is usually known as **tokenization**. While the most simple *tokenizers* would split sentences on dots and words on spaces, these rules don't always take into account all cases (e.g, \"Dr. Evil is not that bad.\" would be split in two sentences, \"Dr\" and \"Evil is not that bad\"). For this reason, more complex rules can be set using [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and then passed in to `CountVectorizer()` via the `token_pattern` parameter.\n"

Some years ago--never mind how long\\r\\nprecisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing\\r\\nparticular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a\\r\\nlittle and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of\\r\\ndriving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I\\r\\nfind myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,\\r\\ndrizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily\\r\\npausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every\\r\\nfuneral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper\\r\\nhand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me\\r\\nfrom deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking\\r\\npeople\\'s hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon\\r\\nas I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a\\r\\nphilosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly\\r\\ntake to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but\\r\\nknew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish\\r\\nvery nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\r\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with\\r\\nher surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its\\r\\nextreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by\\r\\nwaves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of\\r\\nsight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from\\r\\nCorlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,\\r\\nnorthward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around\\r\\nthe town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean\\r\\nreveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the\\r\\npier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some\\r\\nhigh aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better\\r\\nseaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in\\r\\nlath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to\\r\\ndesks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they\\r\\nhere?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\r\\nseemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but\\r\\nthe extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of\\r\\nyonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh\\r\\nthe water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they\\r\\nstand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes\\r\\nand alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet\\r\\nhere they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the\\r\\nneedles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.\\r\\nTake almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down\\r\\nin a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is\\r\\nmagic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his\\r\\ndeepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,\\r\\nand he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all\\r\\nthat region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American\\r\\ndesert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied\\r\\nwith a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation\\r\\nand water are wedded for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,\\r\\nshadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all\\r\\nthe valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There\\r\\nstand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a\\r\\ncrucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his\\r\\ncattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into\\r\\ndistant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of\\r\\nmountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture\\r\\nlies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs\\r\\nlike leaves upon this shepherd\\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the\\r\\nshepherd\\'s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit\\r\\nthe Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade\\r\\nknee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm\\r\\nwanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara\\r\\nbut a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see\\r\\nit?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two\\r\\nhandfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he\\r\\nsadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway\\r\\nBeach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy\\r\\nsoul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your\\r\\nfirst voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical\\r\\nvibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of\\r\\nsight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did\\r\\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely\\r\\nall this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of\\r\\nthat story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the\\r\\ntormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and\\r\\nwas drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and\\r\\noceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this\\r\\nis the key to it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I\\r\\nbegin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of\\r\\nmy lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as\\r\\na passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,\\r\\nand a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,\\r\\npassengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don\\'t sleep of nights--do\\r\\nnot enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a\\r\\npassenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea\\r\\nas a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and\\r\\ndistinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I\\r\\nabominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations\\r\\nof every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take\\r\\ncare of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,\\r\\nschooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess\\r\\nthere is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer\\r\\non ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though\\r\\nonce broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\\r\\npeppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to\\r\\nsay reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the\\r\\nidolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted\\r\\nriver horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their\\r\\nhuge bake-houses the pyramids.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\r\\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\r\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\\r\\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of\\r\\nthing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one\\'s sense of honour,\\r\\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land,\\r\\nthe Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than\\r\\nall, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have\\r\\nbeen lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys\\r\\nstand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\\r\\nfrom a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\\r\\nSeneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even\\r\\nthis wears off in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\\r\\nbroom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,\\r\\nweighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think\\r\\nthe archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\\r\\npromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular\\r\\ninstance?  Who ain\\'t a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the\\r\\nold sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch\\r\\nme about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;\\r\\nthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\\r\\nway--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and\\r\\nso the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\\r\\nother\\'s shoulder-blades, and be content.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\\r\\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\\r\\npenny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves\\r\\nmust pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between\\r\\npaying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most\\r\\nuncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\\r\\nus.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity\\r\\nwith which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering\\r\\nthat we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly\\r\\nills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how\\r\\ncheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\\r\\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,\\r\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\\r\\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\\r\\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\\r\\nthe sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but\\r\\nnot so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in\\r\\nmany other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect\\r\\nit.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea\\r\\nas a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a\\r\\nwhaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who\\r\\nhas the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and\\r\\ninfluences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than\\r\\nany one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,\\r\\nformed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a\\r\\nlong time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo\\r\\nbetween more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the\\r\\nbill must have run something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\\r\\n\"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\\r\\n\"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,\\r\\nthe Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\\r\\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and\\r\\nshort and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in\\r\\nfarces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I\\r\\nrecall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the\\r\\nsprings and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\\r\\nvarious disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,\\r\\nbesides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting\\r\\nfrom my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great\\r\\nwhale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all\\r\\nmy curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his\\r\\nisland bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,\\r\\nwith all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and\\r\\nsounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such\\r\\nthings would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented\\r\\nwith an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden\\r\\nseas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am\\r\\nquick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would\\r\\nthey let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all\\r\\nthe inmates of the place one lodges in.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\\r\\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\\r\\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\\r\\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of\\r\\nthem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carpet-Bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\\r\\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good\\r\\ncity of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a\\r\\nSaturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning\\r\\nthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no\\r\\nway of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop\\r\\nat this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as\\r\\nwell be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my\\r\\nmind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because\\r\\nthere was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected\\r\\nwith that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides\\r\\nthough New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the\\r\\nbusiness of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is\\r\\nnow much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre\\r\\nof this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was\\r\\nstranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal\\r\\nwhalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the\\r\\nLeviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first\\r\\nadventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\\r\\ncobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to\\r\\ndiscover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\\r\\nbowsprit?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before\\r\\nme in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it\\r\\nbecame a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\\r\\nmeanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and\\r\\ndismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the\\r\\nplace.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only\\r\\nbrought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,\\r\\nsaid I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street\\r\\nshouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with\\r\\nthe darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may\\r\\nconclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire\\r\\nthe price, and don\\'t be too particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The\\r\\nCrossed Harpoons\"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\\r\\nFurther on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\"\\r\\nthere came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the\\r\\npacked snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the\\r\\ncongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\\r\\npavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the\\r\\nflinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles\\r\\nof my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and\\r\\njolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare\\r\\nin the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.\\r\\nBut go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\\'t you hear? get away from\\r\\nbefore the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I\\r\\nwent.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,\\r\\nfor there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either\\r\\nhand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a\\r\\ntomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that\\r\\nquarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to\\r\\na smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which\\r\\nstood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant\\r\\nfor the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was\\r\\nto stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the\\r\\nflying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that\\r\\ndestroyed city, Gomorrah?  But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and \"The\\r\\nSword-Fish?\"--this, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"\\r\\nHowever, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed\\r\\non and opened a second, interior door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred\\r\\nblack faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black\\r\\nAngel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;\\r\\nand the preacher\\'s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the\\r\\nweeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered\\r\\nI, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \\'The Trap!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\r\\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\\r\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\\r\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\\r\\nunderneath--\"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\\r\\nthought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I\\r\\nsuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light\\r\\nlooked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and\\r\\nthe dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have\\r\\nbeen carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the\\r\\nswinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought\\r\\nthat here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea\\r\\ncoffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side\\r\\npalsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp\\r\\nbleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse\\r\\nhowling than ever it did about poor Paul\\'s tossed craft.  Euroclydon,\\r\\nnevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with\\r\\nhis feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  \"In judging of that\\r\\ntempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\" says an old writer--of whose\\r\\nworks I possess the only copy extant--\"it maketh a marvellous\\r\\ndifference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where\\r\\nthe frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from\\r\\nthat sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which\\r\\nthe wight Death is the only glazier.\"  True enough, thought I, as\\r\\nthis passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest\\r\\nwell.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the\\r\\nhouse.  What a pity they didn\\'t stop up the chinks and the crannies\\r\\nthough, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it\\'s too\\r\\nlate to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the\\r\\ncopestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\r\\nPoor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for\\r\\nhis pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might\\r\\nplug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and\\r\\nyet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!\\r\\nsays old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one\\r\\nafterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion\\r\\nglitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental\\r\\nsummer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of\\r\\nmaking my own summer with my own coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them\\r\\nup to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in\\r\\nSumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise\\r\\nalong the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit\\r\\nitself, in order to keep out this frost?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before\\r\\nthe door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should\\r\\nbe moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives\\r\\nlike a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a\\r\\npresident of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of\\r\\norphans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\\r\\nis plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our\\r\\nfrosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 3\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spouter-Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\\r\\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\\r\\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very\\r\\nlarge oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,\\r\\nthat in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only\\r\\nby diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\\r\\ncareful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\\r\\nunderstanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades\\r\\nand shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young\\r\\nartist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to\\r\\ndelineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest\\r\\ncontemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by\\r\\nthrowing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at\\r\\nlast come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might\\r\\nnot be altogether unwarranted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\\r\\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\\r\\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\\r\\nnameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\\r\\ndrive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\\r\\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\\r\\nto it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out\\r\\nwhat that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,\\r\\nalas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It\\'s the Black Sea in a\\r\\nmidnight gale.--It\\'s the unnatural combat of the four primal\\r\\nelements.--It\\'s a blasted heath.--It\\'s a Hyperborean winter\\r\\nscene.--It\\'s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at\\r\\nlast all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in\\r\\nthe picture\\'s midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were\\r\\nplain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic\\r\\nfish? even the great leviathan himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the artist\\'s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\r\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\\r\\nwhom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a\\r\\nCape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\\r\\nthere with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\\r\\nexasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in\\r\\nthe enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\\r\\narray of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with\\r\\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\\r\\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\\r\\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\\r\\nmower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous\\r\\ncannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such\\r\\na hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old\\r\\nwhaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were\\r\\nstoried weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,\\r\\nfifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a\\r\\nsunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was\\r\\nflung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards\\r\\nslain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the\\r\\ntail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,\\r\\ntravelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the\\r\\nhump.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut\\r\\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\r\\nfireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier\\r\\nplace is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old\\r\\nwrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some\\r\\nold craft\\'s cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this\\r\\ncorner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a\\r\\nlong, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled\\r\\nwith dusty rarities gathered from this wide world\\'s remotest nooks.\\r\\nProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking\\r\\nden--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale\\'s head.  Be that how it\\r\\nmay, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale\\'s jaw, so wide, a\\r\\ncoach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,\\r\\nranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws\\r\\nof swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed\\r\\nthey called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their\\r\\nmoney, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though\\r\\ntrue cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses\\r\\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel\\r\\nmeridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\\'\\r\\ngoblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS\\r\\na penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,\\r\\nwhich you may gulp down for a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered\\r\\nabout a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of\\r\\nSKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be\\r\\naccommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was\\r\\nfull--not a bed unoccupied.  \"But avast,\" he added, tapping his\\r\\nforehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer\\'s blanket,\\r\\nhave ye?  I s\\'pose you are goin\\' a-whalin\\', so you\\'d better get used\\r\\nto that sort of thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\\r\\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\\r\\nthat if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\\r\\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\\r\\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up\\r\\nwith the half of any decent man\\'s blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?\\r\\nSupper\\'ll be ready directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on\\r\\nthe Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning\\r\\nit with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\\r\\nthe space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under\\r\\nfull sail, but he didn\\'t make much headway, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\r\\nadjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\\r\\nsaid he couldn\\'t afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\\r\\neach in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\\r\\njackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\\r\\nfrozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not\\r\\nonly meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\\r\\nsupper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\\r\\nthese dumplings in a most direful manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you\\'ll have the nightmare to a dead\\r\\nsartainty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\\r\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he\\r\\ndon\\'t--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes \\'em rare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The devil he does,\" says I.  \"Where is that harpooneer?  Is he\\r\\nhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\\r\\ncomplexioned\" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it\\r\\nso turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get\\r\\ninto bed before I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\\r\\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\\r\\nevening as a looker on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the\\r\\nlandlord cried, \"That\\'s the Grampus\\'s crew.  I seed her reported in\\r\\nthe offing this morning; a three years\\' voyage, and a full ship.\\r\\nHurrah, boys; now we\\'ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\\r\\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in\\r\\ntheir shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\\r\\ncomforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\\r\\nicicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\\r\\njust landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\\r\\nentered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\\r\\nwhale\\'s mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\\r\\nofficiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\\r\\nof a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\\r\\npotion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\\r\\nall colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\\r\\nor whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\\r\\nof an ice-island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\\r\\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\\r\\ncapering about most obstreperously.\\r\\n\\r\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\\r\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\\r\\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\\r\\nnoise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\\r\\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\\r\\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\\r\\nI will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\\r\\nsix feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\\r\\ncoffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\\r\\ndeeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\\r\\ncontrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\\r\\nreminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\\r\\nonce announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\\r\\nthought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\\r\\nAlleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\\r\\nhad mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\\r\\nsaw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\\r\\nminutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\\r\\nseems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\\r\\nof \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where\\'s Bulkington?\" and darted out of\\r\\nthe house in pursuit of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now about nine o\\'clock, and the room seeming almost\\r\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\\r\\nmyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\\r\\nthe entrance of the seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\\r\\nrather not sleep with your own brother.  I don\\'t know how it is, but\\r\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\\r\\nto sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\\r\\ntown, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\\r\\nindefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\\r\\nsailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\\r\\nno more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\\r\\nbe sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\\r\\nown hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\\r\\nyour own skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\r\\nthought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\\r\\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\\r\\nof the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\\r\\nover.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\\r\\nto be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\\r\\nme at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\\r\\ncoming?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord!  I\\'ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan\\'t\\r\\nsleep with him.  I\\'ll try the bench here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please; I\\'m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\\r\\nmattress, and it\\'s a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\\r\\nand notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\\'ve got a carpenter\\'s\\r\\nplane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I\\'ll make ye snug enough.\"\\r\\nSo saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\\r\\nfirst dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\\r\\nthe while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\\r\\ntill at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\\r\\nThe landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\\r\\nheaven\\'s sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\\r\\nnot know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\\r\\npine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\\r\\nthrowing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\\r\\nabout his business, and left me in a brown study.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\r\\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\\r\\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\r\\nthan the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\\r\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\\r\\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\\r\\nBut I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\\r\\nfrom under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\\r\\nall, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\\r\\nfrom the window, and both together formed a series of small\\r\\nwhirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\\r\\nto spend the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\\'t I\\r\\nsteal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\\r\\nnot to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\\r\\nidea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\\r\\nbut what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\\r\\nharpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\\r\\ndown!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\\r\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person\\'s bed, I\\r\\nbegan to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\\r\\nprejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I\\'ll wait\\r\\nawhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I\\'ll have a good look at\\r\\nhim then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\\r\\nall--there\\'s no telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\\r\\nthrees, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\\r\\nsuch late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\r\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\\r\\nanswered, \"generally he\\'s an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\\r\\nrise--yes, he\\'s the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\\r\\nwent out a peddling, you see, and I don\\'t see what on airth keeps him\\r\\nso late, unless, may be, he can\\'t sell his head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\\r\\nare telling me?\" getting into a towering rage.  \"Do you pretend to\\r\\nsay, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\\r\\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\\r\\nthis town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn\\'t\\r\\nsell it here, the market\\'s overstocked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With what?\" shouted I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With heads to be sure; ain\\'t there too many heads in the world?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you\\'d better\\r\\nstop spinning that yarn to me--I\\'m not green.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\\r\\nrayther guess you\\'ll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\\r\\nslanderin\\' his head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at\\r\\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s broke a\\'ready,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sartain, and that\\'s the very reason he can\\'t sell it, I guess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\\r\\nsnow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one\\r\\nanother, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\\r\\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\\r\\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\\r\\nhave not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\\r\\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\\r\\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\\r\\nconnexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\\r\\nhighest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\\r\\nwhat this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\\r\\nto spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\\r\\ngood as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\\r\\ntake to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I\\'ve\\r\\nno idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\\r\\nlandlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\\r\\nthereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that\\'s a purty\\r\\nlong sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\\r\\nbe easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin\\' you of has just\\r\\narrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of \\'balmed New\\r\\nZealand heads (great curios, you know), and he\\'s sold all on \\'em but\\r\\none, and that one he\\'s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow\\'s\\r\\nSunday, and it would not do to be sellin\\' human heads about the\\r\\nstreets when folks is goin\\' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\\r\\nbut I stopped him just as he was goin\\' out of the door with four\\r\\nheads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\\r\\nshowed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\\r\\nme--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\\r\\nstayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\\r\\nin such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He pays reg\\'lar,\" was the rejoinder.  \"But come, it\\'s getting\\r\\ndreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it\\'s a nice bed;\\r\\nSal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There\\'s\\r\\nplenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it\\'s an almighty\\r\\nbig bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\\r\\nlittle Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\\r\\nabout one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\\r\\nnear breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn\\'t do.  Come\\r\\nalong here, I\\'ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\\r\\na candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\\r\\nstood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\\r\\n\"I vum it\\'s Sunday--you won\\'t see that harpooneer to-night; he\\'s come\\r\\nto anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON\\'T ye come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\\r\\nwas ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\\r\\nenough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\\r\\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\\r\\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\\r\\nmake yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\\r\\nround from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\\r\\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\\r\\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\\r\\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\\r\\nshelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\\r\\nstriking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\\r\\nthere was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\\r\\ncorner; also a large seaman\\'s bag, containing the harpooneer\\'s\\r\\nwardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\\r\\nparcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\\r\\nfire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\\r\\nthe light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\\r\\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\\r\\nit to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\\r\\nlittle tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\\r\\nround an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\\r\\nthis mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\\r\\nit be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\\r\\nand parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\\r\\nI put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\\r\\nuncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\\r\\nthis mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\\r\\nwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\\r\\nsaw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\\r\\nthat I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\r\\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\\r\\non the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\\r\\nstood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\\r\\nand thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\\r\\nvery cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\\r\\nlandlord said about the harpooneer\\'s not coming home at all that\\r\\nnight, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\\r\\nmy pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\\r\\nbed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\\r\\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\\r\\nsleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\\r\\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\\r\\nheard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\\r\\ncome into the room from under the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\r\\nhead-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\\r\\nword till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\\r\\nNew Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\\r\\nwithout looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\\r\\nfrom me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\\r\\nthe knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\\r\\nroom.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\\r\\nfor some time while employed in unlacing the bag\\'s mouth.  This\\r\\naccomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\\r\\nsight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\\r\\nand there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it\\'s\\r\\njust as I thought, he\\'s a terrible bedfellow; he\\'s been in a fight,\\r\\ngot dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\\r\\nthat moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\\r\\nplainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\\r\\nsquares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\\r\\nfirst I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\\r\\ntruth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\\r\\nwhaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\\r\\nthem.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\\r\\nvoyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\\r\\nthought I, after all!  It\\'s only his outside; a man can be honest in\\r\\nany sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\\r\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\\r\\ncompletely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\\r\\nmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\\r\\nheard of a hot sun\\'s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\\r\\nHowever, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\\r\\nthere produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\\r\\nall these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\\r\\nharpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\\r\\nhaving opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\\r\\npulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\\r\\non.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\\r\\nthen took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\\r\\nit down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\\r\\nhat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\\r\\nhair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\\r\\nscalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\\r\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\\r\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\\r\\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\\r\\nbut it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\\r\\nof this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\\r\\ncomprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\\r\\nnonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\\r\\nmuch afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\\r\\ninto my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\\r\\nthat I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\\r\\nsatisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\\r\\nshowed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\\r\\nwere checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\\r\\nall over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\\r\\nYears\\' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\\r\\nStill more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\\r\\nfrogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\\r\\nplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\\r\\nof a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\\r\\ncountry.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\\r\\nthe heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\\r\\nmine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\r\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\\r\\nthat he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\\r\\nwrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\\r\\nfumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\\r\\ndeformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\\r\\nthree days\\' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\\r\\nI almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\\r\\nin some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\\r\\nand that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\\r\\nthat it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\\r\\nbe.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\\r\\nthe papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\\r\\na tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\\r\\ninside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\\r\\nappropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\\r\\nill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\\r\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\\r\\nplaces them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\\r\\nbiscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\\r\\nshavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\\r\\nsnatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\\r\\n(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\\r\\nin drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\\r\\nlittle, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\\r\\nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\\r\\nnever moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\\r\\nstill stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\\r\\npraying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\\r\\nduring which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\\r\\nAt last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\\r\\nunceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\\r\\ncarelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\\r\\nseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\r\\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\\r\\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\\r\\nwhich I had so long been bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\\r\\none.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\\r\\nit for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\\r\\nat the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\\r\\nmoment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\\r\\nbetween his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\\r\\nhelp it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\\r\\nfeeling me.\\r\\n\\r\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\\r\\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\\r\\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\\r\\nhis guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\\r\\ncomprehended my meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\\r\\nkill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\\r\\nme in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord, for God\\'s sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\\r\\nWatch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\\r\\nthe cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\\r\\nthe hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\\r\\nfire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\\r\\nroom light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\\r\\nwouldn\\'t harm a hair of your head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn\\'t you tell me that\\r\\nthat infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought ye know\\'d it;--didn\\'t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\' heads\\r\\naround town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\\r\\nhere--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\\r\\nsitting up in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\\r\\nthrowing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\\r\\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\\r\\nmoment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\\r\\nlooking cannibal.  What\\'s all this fuss I have been making about,\\r\\nthought I to myself--the man\\'s a human being just as I am: he has\\r\\njust as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\\r\\nBetter sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\\r\\nor whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\\r\\nwill turn in with him.  But I don\\'t fancy having a man smoking in bed\\r\\nwith me.  It\\'s dangerous.  Besides, I ain\\'t insured.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\\r\\nmotioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\\r\\nsay--I won\\'t touch a leg of ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 4\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Counterpane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\\'s arm\\r\\nthrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\\r\\nalmost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\\r\\npatchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\\r\\nand this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\\r\\nlabyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\\r\\nshade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\\r\\nin sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\\r\\ntimes--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\\r\\nstrip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\\r\\nthe arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\\r\\nquilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\\r\\nsense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\\r\\nhugging me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\\r\\na child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\\r\\nme; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\\r\\nsettle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\\r\\nor other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\\r\\nseen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\\r\\nsomehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\\r\\nsupperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\\r\\npacked me off to bed, though it was only two o\\'clock in the afternoon\\r\\nof the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\\r\\nfelt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\\r\\nto my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\\r\\npossible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\\r\\nsheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\\r\\nelapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\\r\\nthe small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\\r\\nthe sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\\r\\nthe streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\\r\\nworse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\\r\\nmy stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\\r\\nmyself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\\r\\ngood slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\\r\\nme to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\\r\\nbest and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\\r\\nmy room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\\r\\ndeal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\\r\\nsubsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\\r\\nnightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\\r\\ndreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\\r\\nin outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\\r\\nframe; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\\r\\nsupernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\\r\\ncounterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\\r\\nto which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\\r\\nFor what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\\r\\nawful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\\r\\nif I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\\r\\nbroken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\\r\\nme; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\\r\\nfor days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\\r\\nattempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\\r\\npuzzle myself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\r\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\\r\\nto those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\\'s pagan\\r\\narm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night\\'s events\\r\\nsoberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\\r\\nalive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\\r\\narm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\\r\\nhugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\\r\\nI now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\\r\\nsnore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\\r\\nhorse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\\r\\ncounterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage\\'s side, as\\r\\nif it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\\r\\nabed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\\r\\ntomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\\r\\nlength, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\\r\\nexpostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\\r\\nin that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\\r\\nand presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\\r\\nNewfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\\r\\npike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\\r\\naltogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\r\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\\r\\nover him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\\r\\nmisgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\\r\\ncreature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\\r\\ncharacter of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\\r\\nthe fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\\r\\nsounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\\r\\nfirst and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\\r\\napartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\\r\\nthis is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\\r\\nhave an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\\r\\nhow essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\\r\\nQueequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\\r\\nconsideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\\r\\nfrom the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\\r\\ncuriosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\\r\\nlike Queequeg you don\\'t see every day, he and his ways were well\\r\\nworth unusual regarding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\\r\\none, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\\r\\nboots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\\r\\nnext movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\\r\\nthe bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\\r\\ninferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\\r\\npropriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\\r\\nwhen putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\\r\\nin the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\\r\\njust enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\\r\\npossible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\\r\\nundergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\\r\\nprobably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\\r\\nif he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\\r\\ngetting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\\r\\nhat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\\r\\ncreaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\\r\\nto boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\\r\\nto order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\\r\\nof a bitter cold morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\\r\\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\\r\\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\\r\\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\\r\\non; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\\r\\nsomewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\\r\\npossible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\\r\\ntime in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\\r\\nQueequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\\r\\nablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\\r\\nwaistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\\r\\ncentre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\\r\\nI was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\\r\\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\\r\\nstock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\\r\\nstriding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\\r\\nscraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\\r\\nthis is using Rogers\\'s best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\\r\\nwondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\\r\\nsteel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\\r\\nlong straight edges are always kept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\\r\\nof the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\\r\\nsporting his harpoon like a marshal\\'s baton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 5\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted\\r\\nthe grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards\\r\\nhim, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter\\r\\nof my bedfellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\\r\\ngood thing; the more\\'s the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own\\r\\nproper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not\\r\\nbe backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be\\r\\nspent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully\\r\\nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you\\r\\nperhaps think for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in\\r\\nthe night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.\\r\\nThey were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and\\r\\nthird mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea\\r\\nblacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny\\r\\ncompany, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing\\r\\nmonkey jackets for morning gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.\\r\\nThis young fellow\\'s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,\\r\\nand would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three\\r\\ndays landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few\\r\\nshades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In\\r\\nthe complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\\r\\nbleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But\\r\\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various\\r\\ntints, seemed like the Andes\\' western slope, to show forth in one\\r\\narray, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grub, ho!\" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\\r\\nwent to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at\\r\\nease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:\\r\\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\\r\\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.\\r\\nBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\\r\\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,\\r\\nin the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo\\'s\\r\\nperformances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best\\r\\nmode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,\\r\\nthat sort of thing is to be had anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\\r\\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear\\r\\nsome good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly\\r\\nevery man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they\\r\\nlooked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom\\r\\nwithout the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the\\r\\nhigh seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without\\r\\nwinking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of\\r\\nthe same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly\\r\\nat each other as though they had never been out of sight of some\\r\\nsheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful\\r\\nbears, these timid warrior whalemen!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head\\r\\nof the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I\\r\\ncannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not\\r\\nhave cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with\\r\\nhim, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table\\r\\nwith it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the\\r\\nbeefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by\\r\\nhim, and every one knows that in most people\\'s estimation, to do\\r\\nanything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\\'s peculiarities here; how he\\r\\neschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\\r\\nbeefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he\\r\\nwithdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his\\r\\ntomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking\\r\\nwith his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\\r\\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\\r\\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\\r\\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\\r\\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from\\r\\nforeign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean\\r\\nmariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street\\r\\nis not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo\\r\\nGreen, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford\\r\\nbeats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts\\r\\nyou see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand\\r\\nchatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry\\r\\non their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,\\r\\nPannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the\\r\\nwhaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see\\r\\nother sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There\\r\\nweekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New\\r\\nHampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They\\r\\nare mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled\\r\\nforests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.\\r\\nMany are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some\\r\\nthings you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that\\r\\nchap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and\\r\\nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\\r\\nHere comes another with a sou\\'-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a\\r\\ndownright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\\r\\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when\\r\\na country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a\\r\\ndistinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you\\r\\nshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In\\r\\nbespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;\\r\\nstraps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will\\r\\nburst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,\\r\\nstraps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\\r\\nand bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is\\r\\na queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land\\r\\nwould this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast\\r\\nof Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to\\r\\nfrighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the\\r\\ndearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,\\r\\ntrue enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.\\r\\nThe streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave\\r\\nthem with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America\\r\\nwill you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more\\r\\nopulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon\\r\\nthis once scraggy scoria of a country?\\r\\n\\r\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\\r\\nmansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave\\r\\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and\\r\\nIndian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up\\r\\nhither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat\\r\\nlike that?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\r\\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\r\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they\\r\\nsay, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night\\r\\nrecklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long\\r\\navenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful\\r\\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\\r\\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent\\r\\nis art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced\\r\\nbright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside\\r\\nat creation\\'s final day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.\\r\\nBut roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their\\r\\ncheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere\\r\\nmatch that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell\\r\\nme the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell\\r\\nthem miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous\\r\\nMoluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 7\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\\'s Chapel, and few\\r\\nare the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or\\r\\nPacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that\\r\\nI did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\\r\\nspecial errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to\\r\\ndriving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the\\r\\ncloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.\\r\\nEntering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and\\r\\nsailors\\' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at\\r\\ntimes by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed\\r\\npurposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were\\r\\ninsular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\\r\\nthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing\\r\\nseveral marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on\\r\\neither side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the\\r\\nfollowing, but I do not pretend to quote:--\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nJOHN TALBOT,\\r\\nWho, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,\\r\\nNear the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,\\r\\nNovember 1st, 1836.\\r\\nTHIS TABLET\\r\\nIs erected to his Memory\\r\\nBY HIS\\r\\nSISTER.\\r\\n_____________\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,\\r\\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY,\\r\\nAND SAMUEL GLEIG,\\r\\nForming one of the boats\\' crews\\r\\nOF\\r\\nTHE SHIP ELIZA\\r\\nWho were towed out of sight by a Whale,\\r\\nOn the Off-shore Ground in the\\r\\nPACIFIC,\\r\\nDecember 31st, 1839.\\r\\nTHIS MARBLE\\r\\nIs here placed by their surviving\\r\\nSHIPMATES.\\r\\n_____________\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nThe late\\r\\nCAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,\\r\\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a\\r\\nSperm Whale on the coast of Japan,\\r\\nAUGUST 3d, 1833.\\r\\nTHIS TABLET\\r\\nIs erected to his Memory\\r\\nBY\\r\\nHIS WIDOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\\r\\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\\r\\nQueequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was\\r\\na wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This\\r\\nsavage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;\\r\\nbecause he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was\\r\\nnot reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of\\r\\nthe relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among\\r\\nthe congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded\\r\\naccidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present\\r\\nwear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,\\r\\nthat I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose\\r\\nunhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically\\r\\ncaused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\\r\\namong flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the\\r\\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in\\r\\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in\\r\\nthose immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden\\r\\ninfidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and\\r\\nrefuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished\\r\\nwithout a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of\\r\\nElephanta as here.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\\r\\nwhy it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\\r\\ntales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it\\r\\nis that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we\\r\\nprefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle\\r\\nhim, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;\\r\\nwhy the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon\\r\\nimmortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,\\r\\nhopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries\\r\\nago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we\\r\\nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the\\r\\nliving so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a\\r\\nknocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are\\r\\nnot without their meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\\r\\ndead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\\r\\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\\r\\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\\r\\nhad gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But\\r\\nsomehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine\\r\\nchance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an\\r\\nimmortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of\\r\\nwhaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into\\r\\nEternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this\\r\\nmatter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow\\r\\nhere on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at\\r\\nthings spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun\\r\\nthrough the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.\\r\\nMethinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take\\r\\nmy body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three\\r\\ncheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they\\r\\nwill, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 8\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\r\\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back\\r\\nupon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\\r\\ncongregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\\r\\nchaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\\r\\nwhalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a\\r\\nsailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\\r\\ndedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\\r\\nFather Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\\r\\nof old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\\r\\namong all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\\r\\ngleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\\r\\neven beneath February\\'s snow.  No one having previously heard his\\r\\nhistory, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\\r\\nutmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\\r\\npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\\r\\nhe had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\\r\\nand certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\\r\\ndown with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\\r\\nalmost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\\r\\nabsorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\\r\\nremoved, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\\r\\narrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\r\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\r\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\r\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\r\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\\r\\nside ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\\r\\nThe wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\\r\\npair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\\r\\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\\r\\ncontrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\\r\\nmeans in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\\r\\nladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\\r\\nman-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\\r\\nsailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\\r\\nthe steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\r\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\\r\\nof wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\\r\\nglimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\\r\\nfor a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\\r\\nFor I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\\r\\nslowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\\r\\nthe ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\\r\\nhim impregnable in his little Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\r\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\r\\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\r\\nmere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\\r\\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\\r\\nunseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\\r\\nsignifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\\r\\nworldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\\r\\nwine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\\r\\na self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\\r\\nperennial well of water within the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\r\\nborrowed from the chaplain\\'s former sea-farings.  Between the marble\\r\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\\r\\nback was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\\r\\nbeating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\\r\\nsnowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\\r\\nclouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\\r\\nforth an angel\\'s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\\r\\nradiance upon the ship\\'s tossed deck, something like that silver\\r\\nplate now inserted into the Victory\\'s plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\\r\\nnoble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\\r\\nship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the\\r\\nclouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\\r\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\\r\\nthe likeness of a ship\\'s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\\r\\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\\'s\\r\\nfiddle-headed beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\\r\\nearth\\'s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\\r\\nleads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God\\'s quick wrath is\\r\\nfirst descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From\\r\\nthence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\\r\\nfavourable winds.  Yes, the world\\'s a ship on its passage out, and not\\r\\na voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\\r\\nordered the scattered people to condense.  \"Starboard gangway,\\r\\nthere! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!\\r\\nMidships! midships!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\\r\\nstill slighter shuffling of women\\'s shoes, and all was quiet again,\\r\\nand every eye on the preacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\\'s bows, folded his\\r\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\r\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\\r\\nat the bottom of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of\\r\\na bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he\\r\\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\\r\\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and\\r\\njoy--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ribs and terrors in the whale,\\r\\nArched over me a dismal gloom,\\r\\nWhile all God\\'s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\r\\nAnd lift me deepening down to doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw the opening maw of hell,\\r\\nWith endless pains and sorrows there;\\r\\nWhich none but they that feel can tell--\\r\\nOh, I was plunging to despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In black distress, I called my God,\\r\\nWhen I could scarce believe him mine,\\r\\nHe bowed his ear to my complaints--\\r\\nNo more the whale did me confine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With speed he flew to my relief,\\r\\nAs on a radiant dolphin borne;\\r\\nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone\\r\\nThe face of my Deliverer God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My song for ever shall record\\r\\nThat terrible, that joyful hour;\\r\\nI give the glory to my God,\\r\\nHis all the mercy and the power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\r\\nhowling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly\\r\\nturned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand\\r\\ndown upon the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last\\r\\nverse of the first chapter of Jonah--\\'And God had prepared a great\\r\\nfish to swallow up Jonah.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is\\r\\none of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.\\r\\nYet what depths of the soul does Jonah\\'s deep sealine sound! what a\\r\\npregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that\\r\\ncanticle in the fish\\'s belly!  How billow-like and boisterously\\r\\ngrand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the\\r\\nkelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is\\r\\nabout us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\\r\\nShipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful\\r\\nmen, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,\\r\\nit is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,\\r\\nhard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,\\r\\nrepentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.\\r\\nAs with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in\\r\\nhis wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what\\r\\nthat command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.\\r\\nBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to\\r\\ndo--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors\\r\\nto persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it\\r\\nis in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God\\r\\nconsists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\r\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men\\r\\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\\r\\nCaptains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and\\r\\nseeks a ship that\\'s bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a\\r\\nhitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have\\r\\nbeen no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That\\'s the opinion of\\r\\nlearned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as\\r\\nfar by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in\\r\\nthose ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\\r\\nBecause Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly\\r\\ncoast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more\\r\\nthan two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the\\r\\nStraits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought\\r\\nto flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible\\r\\nand worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking\\r\\nfrom his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar\\r\\nhastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his\\r\\nlook, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere\\r\\nsuspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a\\r\\ndeck.  How plainly he\\'s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,\\r\\nvalise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with\\r\\ntheir adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the\\r\\nTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps\\r\\non board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\\r\\nmoment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\\'s evil\\r\\neye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\\r\\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of\\r\\nthe man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome\\r\\nbut still serious way, one whispers to the other--\"Jack, he\\'s robbed\\r\\na widow;\" or, \"Joe, do you mark him; he\\'s a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry\\r\\nlad, I guess he\\'s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or\\r\\nbelike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\"  Another runs to\\r\\nread the bill that\\'s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which\\r\\nthe ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the\\r\\napprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his\\r\\nperson.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\\r\\nsympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\\r\\nhands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\\r\\nboldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will\\r\\nnot confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.\\r\\nSo he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be\\r\\nthe man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into\\r\\nthe cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Who\\'s there?\\' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\\r\\nout his papers for the Customs--\\'Who\\'s there?\\'  Oh! how that harmless\\r\\nquestion mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee\\r\\nagain.  But he rallies.  \\'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;\\r\\nhow soon sail ye, sir?\\'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up\\r\\nto Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he\\r\\nhear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  \\'We\\r\\nsail with the next coming tide,\\' at last he slowly answered, still\\r\\nintently eyeing him.  \\'No sooner, sir?\\'--\\'Soon enough for any honest\\r\\nman that goes a passenger.\\'  Ha!  Jonah, that\\'s another stab.  But he\\r\\nswiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  \\'I\\'ll sail with\\r\\nye,\\'--he says,--\\'the passage money how much is that?--I\\'ll pay now.\\'\\r\\nFor it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not\\r\\nto be overlooked in this history, \\'that he paid the fare thereof\\' ere\\r\\nthe craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now Jonah\\'s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\\r\\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.\\r\\nIn this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,\\r\\nand without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at\\r\\nall frontiers.  So Jonah\\'s Captain prepares to test the length of\\r\\nJonah\\'s purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the\\r\\nusual sum; and it\\'s assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah\\r\\nis a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that\\r\\npaves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,\\r\\nprudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to\\r\\nfind a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is\\r\\nput down for his passage.  \\'Point out my state-room, Sir,\\' says Jonah\\r\\nnow, \\'I\\'m travel-weary; I need sleep.\\'  \\'Thou lookest like it,\\' says\\r\\nthe Captain, \\'there\\'s thy room.\\'  Jonah enters, and would lock the\\r\\ndoor, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling\\r\\nthere, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\\r\\nabout the doors of convicts\\' cells being never allowed to be locked\\r\\nwithin.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\\r\\nhis berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\\r\\nhis forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that\\r\\ncontracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship\\'s water-line, Jonah\\r\\nfeels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the\\r\\nwhale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels\\' wards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\r\\noscillates in Jonah\\'s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\r\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\r\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\\r\\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\\r\\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\\r\\nhung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\\r\\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\\r\\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that\\r\\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the\\r\\nceiling, and the side, are all awry.  \\'Oh! so my conscience hangs in\\r\\nme!\\' he groans, \\'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of\\r\\nmy soul are all in crookedness!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\r\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of\\r\\nthe Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into\\r\\nhim; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in\\r\\ngiddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;\\r\\nand at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over\\r\\nhim, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the\\r\\nwound, and there\\'s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in\\r\\nhis berth, Jonah\\'s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;\\r\\nand from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all\\r\\ncareening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of\\r\\nrecorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he\\r\\nwill not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the\\r\\nship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to\\r\\nlighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;\\r\\nwhen the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank\\r\\nthunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\\'s head; in all this\\r\\nraging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky\\r\\nand raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or\\r\\nheeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open\\r\\nmouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone\\r\\ndown into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken\\r\\nit, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and\\r\\nshrieks in his dead ear, \\'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\\'\\r\\nStartled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his\\r\\nfeet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon\\r\\nthe sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow\\r\\nleaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,\\r\\nand finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the\\r\\nmariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the\\r\\nwhite moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the\\r\\nblackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing\\r\\nhigh upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his\\r\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The\\r\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\\r\\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter\\r\\nto high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose\\r\\ncause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah\\'s; that\\r\\ndiscovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.\\r\\n\\'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What\\r\\npeople?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The\\r\\neager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they\\r\\nnot only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another\\r\\nanswer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is\\r\\nforced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am a Hebrew,\\' he cries--and then--\\'I fear the Lord the God of\\r\\nHeaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\\'  Fear him, O Jonah?\\r\\nAye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now\\r\\ngoes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more\\r\\nand more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet\\r\\nsupplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness\\r\\nof his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him\\r\\nand cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this\\r\\ngreat tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek\\r\\nby other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale\\r\\nhowls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the\\r\\nother they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\\r\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\\r\\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth\\r\\nwater behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a\\r\\nmasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops\\r\\nseething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to\\r\\nall his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then\\r\\nJonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish\\'s belly.  But observe his\\r\\nprayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does\\r\\nnot weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful\\r\\npunishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting\\r\\nhimself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will\\r\\nstill look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and\\r\\nfaithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\\r\\npunishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is\\r\\nshown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.\\r\\nShipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin\\r\\nbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;\\r\\nbut if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\r\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\\r\\nwhen describing Jonah\\'s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\r\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\\r\\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\\r\\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all\\r\\nhis simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\\r\\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\\r\\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head\\r\\nlowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake\\r\\nthese words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\\r\\nupon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson\\r\\nthat Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still\\r\\nmore to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly\\r\\nwould I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there\\r\\nwhere you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads\\r\\nME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a\\r\\npilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or\\r\\nspeaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those\\r\\nunwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at\\r\\nthe hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to\\r\\nescape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is\\r\\neverywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came\\r\\nupon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of\\r\\ndoom, and with swift slantings tore him along \\'into the midst of the\\r\\nseas,\\' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,\\r\\nand \\'the weeds were wrapped about his head,\\' and all the watery world\\r\\nof woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any\\r\\nplummet--\\'out of the belly of hell\\'--when the whale grounded upon the\\r\\nocean\\'s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting\\r\\nprophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the\\r\\nshuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up\\r\\ntowards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and\\r\\nearth; and \\'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\\' when the word of\\r\\nthe Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,\\r\\nlike two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the\\r\\nocean--Jonah did the Almighty\\'s bidding.  And what was that,\\r\\nshipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was\\r\\nit!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\\r\\nthe living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms\\r\\nfrom Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters\\r\\nwhen God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please\\r\\nrather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than\\r\\ngoodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe\\r\\nto him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!\\r\\nYea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching\\r\\nto others is himself a castaway!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\\r\\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out\\r\\nwith a heavenly enthusiasm,--\"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard\\r\\nhand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of\\r\\nthat delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the\\r\\nmain-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,\\r\\nfar upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and\\r\\ncommodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.\\r\\nDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of\\r\\nthis base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to\\r\\nhim, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and\\r\\ndestroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of\\r\\nSenators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who\\r\\nacknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a\\r\\npatriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the\\r\\nbillows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this\\r\\nsure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be\\r\\nhis, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O\\r\\nFather!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I\\r\\ndie.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\\'s, or\\r\\nmine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what\\r\\nis man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face\\r\\nwith his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had\\r\\ndeparted, and he was left alone in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 10\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bosom Friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\\r\\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\\r\\ntime.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on\\r\\nthe stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face\\r\\nthat little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\\r\\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\\r\\nhimself in his heathenish way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,\\r\\ngoing to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his\\r\\nlap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every\\r\\nfiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly\\r\\naround him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of\\r\\nastonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming\\r\\nto commence at number one each time, as though he could not count\\r\\nmore than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties\\r\\nbeing found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages\\r\\nwas excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and\\r\\nhideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his\\r\\ncountenance yet had a something in it which was by no means\\r\\ndisagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly\\r\\ntattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and\\r\\nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of\\r\\na spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,\\r\\nthere was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his\\r\\nuncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had\\r\\nnever cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,\\r\\nthat his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and\\r\\nbrighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,\\r\\nthis I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was\\r\\nphrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it\\r\\nreminded me of General Washington\\'s head, as seen in the popular\\r\\nbusts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope\\r\\nfrom above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two\\r\\nlong promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George\\r\\nWashington cannibalistically developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to\\r\\nbe looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\\r\\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\\r\\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\\r\\nbook.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the\\r\\nnight previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had\\r\\nfound thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this\\r\\nindifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at\\r\\ntimes you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are\\r\\noverawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a\\r\\nSocratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at\\r\\nall, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made\\r\\nno advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the\\r\\ncircle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;\\r\\nyet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\\r\\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of\\r\\nCape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown\\r\\namong people as strange to him as though he were in the planet\\r\\nJupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the\\r\\nutmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to\\r\\nhimself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt\\r\\nhe had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to\\r\\nbe true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living\\r\\nor so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives\\r\\nhimself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic\\r\\nold woman, he must have \"broken his digester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\\r\\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it\\r\\nthen only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms\\r\\ngathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,\\r\\nsolitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began\\r\\nto be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more\\r\\nmy splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish\\r\\nworld.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very\\r\\nindifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized\\r\\nhypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights\\r\\nto see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.\\r\\nAnd those same things that would have repelled most others, they were\\r\\nthe very magnets that thus drew me.  I\\'ll try a pagan friend, thought\\r\\nI, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew\\r\\nmy bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my\\r\\nbest to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these\\r\\nadvances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night\\'s\\r\\nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be\\r\\nbedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,\\r\\nperhaps a little complimented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\\r\\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\\r\\nthat were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\\r\\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\\r\\nbe seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\\r\\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And\\r\\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping\\r\\nit regularly passing between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\\'s\\r\\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\\r\\nleft us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\\r\\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\\r\\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\\r\\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\\'s phrase, that we\\r\\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.\\r\\nIn a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed\\r\\nfar too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple\\r\\nsavage those old rules would not apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\\r\\ntogether.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\\r\\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\\r\\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\\r\\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of\\r\\nthem towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;\\r\\nbut he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\\' pockets.  I let\\r\\nthem stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his\\r\\nidol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and\\r\\nsymptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well\\r\\nknowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case\\r\\nhe invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\r\\nPresbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator\\r\\nin worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.\\r\\nDo you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\\r\\nearth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an\\r\\ninsignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is\\r\\nworship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the\\r\\nwill of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man\\r\\nto do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow\\r\\nman.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,\\r\\nunite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.\\r\\nConsequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn\\r\\nidolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent\\r\\nlittle idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before\\r\\nhim twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and\\r\\nwent to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.\\r\\nBut we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for\\r\\nconfidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,\\r\\nthere open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old\\r\\ncouples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,\\r\\nthen, in our hearts\\' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving\\r\\npair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 11\\r\\n\\r\\nNightgown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\\r\\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\\r\\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\\r\\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,\\r\\nwhat little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we\\r\\nfelt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down\\r\\nthe future.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\\r\\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\\r\\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\\r\\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\\r\\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We\\r\\nfelt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of\\r\\ndoors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire\\r\\nin the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily\\r\\nwarmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality\\r\\nin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing\\r\\nexists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over\\r\\ncomfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to\\r\\nbe comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,\\r\\nthe tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,\\r\\nwhy then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most\\r\\ndelightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping\\r\\napartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the\\r\\nluxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of\\r\\ndeliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and\\r\\nyour snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like\\r\\nthe one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all\\r\\nat once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,\\r\\nwhether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way\\r\\nof always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the\\r\\nsnugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own\\r\\nidentity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were\\r\\nindeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more\\r\\ncongenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming\\r\\nout of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and\\r\\ncoarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o\\'clock-at-night, I\\r\\nexperienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the\\r\\nhint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,\\r\\nseeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong\\r\\ndesire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that\\r\\nthough I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed\\r\\nthe night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when\\r\\nlove once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than\\r\\nto have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be\\r\\nfull of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly\\r\\nconcerned for the landlord\\'s policy of insurance.  I was only alive\\r\\nto the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a\\r\\nblanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our\\r\\nshoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till\\r\\nslowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated\\r\\nby the flame of the new-lit lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\\r\\nfar distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native\\r\\nisland; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and\\r\\ntell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill\\r\\ncomprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when\\r\\nI had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me\\r\\nto present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton\\r\\nI give.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 12\\r\\n\\r\\nBiographical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West\\r\\nand South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in\\r\\na grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\\r\\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg\\'s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\\r\\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\\r\\ntwo.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;\\r\\nand on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\\r\\nunconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his\\r\\nveins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal\\r\\npropensity he nourished in his untutored youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\\'s bay, and Queequeg sought a\\r\\npassage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement\\r\\nof seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\\'s\\r\\ninfluence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his\\r\\ncanoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship\\r\\nmust pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a\\r\\ncoral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove\\r\\nthickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still\\r\\nafloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in\\r\\nthe stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like\\r\\na flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his\\r\\nfoot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing\\r\\nhimself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and\\r\\nswore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\\r\\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\\r\\nQueequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\\r\\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\\r\\ntold him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young\\r\\nsavage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain\\'s cabin.\\r\\nThey put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But\\r\\nlike Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,\\r\\nQueequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily\\r\\ngain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at\\r\\nbottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn\\r\\namong the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still\\r\\nhappier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\\r\\nwere.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\\r\\neven Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\\r\\nso, than all his father\\'s heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag\\r\\nHarbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to\\r\\nNantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,\\r\\npoor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it\\'s a wicked world\\r\\nin all meridians; I\\'ll die a pagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these\\r\\nChristians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.\\r\\nHence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and\\r\\nhaving a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and\\r\\ngone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered\\r\\nno, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather\\r\\nChristians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled\\r\\nthrone of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he\\r\\nwould return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the\\r\\nnonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in\\r\\nall four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed\\r\\niron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\\r\\nmovements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.\\r\\nUpon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed\\r\\nhim of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most\\r\\npromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at\\r\\nonce resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same\\r\\nvessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with\\r\\nme, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly\\r\\ndip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously\\r\\nassented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was\\r\\nan experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great\\r\\nusefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries\\r\\nof whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant\\r\\nseamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\\'s last dying puff, Queequeg\\r\\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\\r\\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very\\r\\nsoon were sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 13\\r\\n\\r\\nWheelbarrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a\\r\\nbarber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade\\'s bill; using,\\r\\nhowever, my comrade\\'s money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the\\r\\nboarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had\\r\\nsprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin\\'s cock\\r\\nand bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me\\r\\nconcerning the very person whom I now companied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\\r\\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\\'s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\\r\\ndown to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at\\r\\nthe wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg\\r\\nso much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\r\\nstreets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But\\r\\nwe heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and\\r\\nQueequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\\r\\nbarbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him\\r\\nashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own\\r\\nharpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I\\r\\nhinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own\\r\\nharpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal\\r\\ncombat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,\\r\\nlike many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers\\' meadows\\r\\narmed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish\\r\\nthem--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his\\r\\nown harpoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story\\r\\nabout the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.\\r\\nThe owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry\\r\\nhis heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about\\r\\nthe thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise\\r\\nway in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;\\r\\nlashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the\\r\\nwharf.  \"Why,\" said I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better than\\r\\nthat, one would think.  Didn\\'t the people laugh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of\\r\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant\\r\\nwater of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a\\r\\npunchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament\\r\\non the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand\\r\\nmerchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all\\r\\naccounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea\\r\\ncaptain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of\\r\\nQueequeg\\'s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;\\r\\nwhen all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride\\'s bamboo\\r\\ncottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of\\r\\nhonour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the\\r\\nHigh Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg\\'s father.  Grace being\\r\\nsaid,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though\\r\\nQueequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to\\r\\nour platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance\\r\\nupwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,\\r\\nthe High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the\\r\\nisland; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers\\r\\ninto the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself\\r\\nplaced next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\\r\\nhimself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a\\r\\nmere island King, especially in the King\\'s own house--the Captain\\r\\ncoolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I\\r\\nsuppose for a huge finger-glass.  \"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you\\r\\ntink now?--Didn\\'t our people laugh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\\r\\nschooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one\\r\\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered\\r\\ntrees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and\\r\\nmountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by\\r\\nside the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at\\r\\nlast; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\\r\\nblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening\\r\\nthat new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long\\r\\nvoyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a\\r\\nthird, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,\\r\\nyea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the\\r\\nlittle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\\r\\nsnortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that\\r\\nturnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks\\r\\nof slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity\\r\\nof the sea which will permit no records.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\\r\\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\\r\\nteeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\\r\\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\\r\\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\\r\\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land\\r\\ntornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\\r\\nplunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering\\r\\nglances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that\\r\\ntwo fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man\\r\\nwere anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there\\r\\nwere some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense\\r\\ngreenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.\\r\\nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\\r\\nback.  I thought the bumpkin\\'s hour of doom was come.  Dropping his\\r\\nharpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\\r\\nmiraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the\\r\\nair; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow\\r\\nlanded with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\\r\\nback upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a\\r\\npuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\\r\\n\"Capting, Capting, here\\'s the devil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo, YOU sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\\r\\nup to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don\\'t you know\\r\\nyou might have killed that chap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\"\\r\\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\\r\\nunearthly expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\\r\\nQueequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I\\'ll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if\\r\\nyou try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain\\r\\nto mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had\\r\\nparted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from\\r\\nside to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\\r\\nThe poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept\\r\\noverboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\\r\\nboom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and\\r\\nback again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\\r\\nseemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\\r\\nand nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\\r\\ntowards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\\r\\njaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\\r\\nQueequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\\r\\nthe boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\\r\\nand then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\\r\\nit swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\\r\\ntrapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\\r\\nwhile the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\\r\\nto the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\\r\\nFor three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\\r\\nhis long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\\r\\nbrawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\\r\\nand glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\\r\\ngone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\\r\\nQueequeg, now took an instant\\'s glance around him, and seeming to see\\r\\njust how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\\r\\nmore, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\\r\\nother dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\\r\\npoor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\\r\\nthe captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg\\r\\nlike a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that\\r\\nhe at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.\\r\\nHe only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine\\r\\noff; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning\\r\\nagainst the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to\\r\\nbe saying to himself--\"It\\'s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all\\r\\nmeridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 14\\r\\n\\r\\nNantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after\\r\\na fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\nNantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner\\r\\nof the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more\\r\\nlonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,\\r\\nand elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more\\r\\nsand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for\\r\\nblotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to\\r\\nplant weeds there, they don\\'t grow naturally; that they import Canada\\r\\nthistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a\\r\\nleak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried\\r\\nabout like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant\\r\\ntoadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer\\r\\ntime; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day\\'s\\r\\nwalk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like\\r\\nLaplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every\\r\\nway inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,\\r\\nthat to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be\\r\\nfound adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these\\r\\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\r\\nsettled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an\\r\\neagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an\\r\\ninfant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their\\r\\nchild borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to\\r\\nfollow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a\\r\\nperilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an\\r\\nempty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian\\'s skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\\r\\ntake to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and\\r\\nquohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for\\r\\nmackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured\\r\\ncod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,\\r\\nexplored this watery world; put an incessant belt of\\r\\ncircumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring\\'s Straits; and in\\r\\nall seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the\\r\\nmightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous\\r\\nand most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed\\r\\nwith such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics\\r\\nare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing\\r\\nfrom their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery\\r\\nworld like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the\\r\\nAtlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did\\r\\nPoland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;\\r\\nlet the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing\\r\\nbanner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the\\r\\nNantucketer\\'s.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own\\r\\nempires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant\\r\\nships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even\\r\\npirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the\\r\\nroad, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like\\r\\nthemselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless\\r\\ndeep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;\\r\\nhe alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro\\r\\nploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE\\r\\nlies his business, which a Noah\\'s flood would not interrupt, though\\r\\nit overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as\\r\\nprairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs\\r\\nthem as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the\\r\\nland; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another\\r\\nworld, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the\\r\\nlandless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep\\r\\nbetween billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of\\r\\nland, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very\\r\\npillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 15\\r\\n\\r\\nChowder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\\r\\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\\r\\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The\\r\\nlandlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea\\r\\nHussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one\\r\\nof the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured\\r\\nus that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.\\r\\nIn short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than\\r\\ntry pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us\\r\\nabout keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened\\r\\na white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard\\r\\nhand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that\\r\\ndone, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these\\r\\ncrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially\\r\\nas, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our\\r\\nfirst point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas\\r\\nI had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.\\r\\nHowever, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and\\r\\nthen knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at\\r\\nlast came to something which there was no mistaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\\' ears,\\r\\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\\r\\nold doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the\\r\\nother side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a\\r\\ngallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the\\r\\ntime, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague\\r\\nmisgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\\r\\nremaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.\\r\\nIt\\'s ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my\\r\\nfirst whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen\\'s\\r\\nchapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!\\r\\nAre these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\\r\\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\\r\\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an\\r\\ninjured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple\\r\\nwoollen shirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I\\'ll be combing ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right.  There\\'s Mrs. Hussey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\\r\\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon\\r\\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\\r\\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\\r\\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\\r\\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that about Cods, ma\\'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\"\\r\\nsays I, \"but that\\'s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\\r\\ntime, ain\\'t it, Mrs. Hussey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\\r\\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear\\r\\nnothing but the word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door\\r\\nleading to the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for\\r\\nus both on one clam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\r\\napparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking\\r\\nchowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet\\r\\nfriends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely\\r\\nbigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted\\r\\npork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and\\r\\nplentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being\\r\\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing\\r\\nhis favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being\\r\\nsurpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when\\r\\nleaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey\\'s clam and cod\\r\\nannouncement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to\\r\\nthe kitchen door, I uttered the word \"cod\" with great emphasis, and\\r\\nresumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth\\r\\nagain, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine\\r\\ncod-chowder was placed before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks\\r\\nI to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\\r\\nWhat\\'s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  \"But\\r\\nlook, Queequeg, ain\\'t that a live eel in your bowl?  Where\\'s your\\r\\nharpoon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\\r\\nits name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder\\r\\nfor breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till\\r\\nyou began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The\\r\\narea before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a\\r\\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his\\r\\naccount books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy\\r\\nflavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till\\r\\none morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some\\r\\nfishermen\\'s boats, I saw Hosea\\'s brindled cow feeding on fish\\r\\nremnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod\\'s\\r\\ndecapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\r\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\\r\\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and\\r\\ndemanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  \"Why\\r\\nnot? said I; \"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why\\r\\nnot?\"  \"Because it\\'s dangerous,\" says she.  \"Ever since young Stiggs\\r\\ncoming from that unfort\\'nt v\\'y\\'ge of his, when he was gone four years\\r\\nand a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my\\r\\nfirst floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I\\r\\nallow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at\\r\\nnight.  So, Mr. Queequeg\" (for she had learned his name), \"I will\\r\\njust take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the\\r\\nchowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" says I; \"and let\\'s have a couple of smoked herring by way of\\r\\nvariety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 16\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and\\r\\nno small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had\\r\\nbeen diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little\\r\\ngod--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly\\r\\ninsisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\\r\\nthe whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\\r\\ninstead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\\r\\nthe ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\\r\\nbefriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\\r\\nvessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\\r\\nupon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\\r\\nthat vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\\r\\nirrespective of Queequeg.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\\r\\ngreat confidence in the excellence of Yojo\\'s judgment and surprising\\r\\nforecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\\r\\nrather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\\r\\nwhole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\\'s, or rather Yojo\\'s, touching the\\r\\nselection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a\\r\\nlittle relied upon Queequeg\\'s sagacity to point out the whaler best\\r\\nfitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my\\r\\nremonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\\r\\nacquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\\r\\ndetermined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\\r\\nsettle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\\r\\nQueequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\\r\\nit was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\\r\\nand prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could\\r\\nfind out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\\r\\ncould master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,\\r\\nthen, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\\r\\nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\\r\\nAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\\r\\nthat there were three ships up for three-years\\' voyages--The\\r\\nDevil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know\\r\\nthe origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt\\r\\nremember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts\\r\\nIndians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about\\r\\nthe Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,\\r\\ngoing on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\\r\\ndecided that this was the very ship for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\r\\nknow;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\\r\\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\\r\\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\\r\\nold school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\\r\\nclaw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\\r\\ntyphoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull\\'s complexion was\\r\\ndarkened like a French grenadier\\'s, who has alike fought in Egypt and\\r\\nSiberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\\r\\nsomewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\\r\\noverboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\\r\\nthe three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\\r\\nwrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\\r\\nCathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\\r\\nwere added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\\r\\nbusiness that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\\r\\nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\\r\\nvessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\\r\\nowners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\\r\\nchief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\\r\\nit, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\\r\\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\\'s carved buckler or\\r\\nbedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\\r\\nhis neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\\r\\ntrophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\\r\\nchased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\\r\\nbulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\\r\\nteeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\\r\\nhempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\\r\\nof land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\\r\\nScorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\\r\\ntiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\\r\\nlong narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\\r\\nsteered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\\r\\nholds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\\r\\nsomehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\\r\\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\\r\\nat first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\\r\\nof tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\\r\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\\r\\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\\r\\nlimber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\\r\\nof the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\\r\\ncircle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\\r\\nother, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\\r\\nhairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\\r\\nPottowottamie Sachem\\'s head.  A triangular opening faced towards the\\r\\nbows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\\r\\nby his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\\r\\nthe ship\\'s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\\r\\nof command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\\r\\nall over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\\r\\na stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\r\\nconstructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance\\r\\nof the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old\\r\\nseamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker\\r\\nstyle; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\\r\\nminutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\\r\\nfrom his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\\r\\nwindward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\\r\\npursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of\\r\\nthe tent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\\r\\nhim?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of shipping.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in\\r\\na stove boat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Sir, I never have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I\\'ve been\\r\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see\\r\\nthat leg?--I\\'ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou\\r\\ntalkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service\\r\\nindeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in\\r\\nthose marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a\\r\\nwhaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don\\'t it, eh?--Hast not\\r\\nbeen a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst\\r\\nthou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to\\r\\nsea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask\\r\\nof these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\\r\\nQuakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\\r\\ndistrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\\r\\nVineyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think\\r\\nof shipping ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain\\r\\nAhab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain\\r\\nhimself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that\\'s who ye are speaking to,\\r\\nyoung man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod\\r\\nfitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including\\r\\ncrew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if\\r\\nthou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can\\r\\nput ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past\\r\\nbacking out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find\\r\\nthat he has only one leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\\r\\nchewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped\\r\\na boat!--ah, ah!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched\\r\\nat the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly\\r\\nas I could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could\\r\\nI know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,\\r\\nthough indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of\\r\\nthe accident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\\'ye see; thou\\r\\ndost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye\\'ve been to sea before now; sure\\r\\nof that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\\r\\nthe merchant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant\\r\\nservice--don\\'t aggravate me--I won\\'t have it.  But let us understand\\r\\neach other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye\\r\\nyet feel inclined for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\\r\\nwhale\\'s throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\\r\\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don\\'t take to be the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to\\r\\nfind out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in\\r\\norder to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.\\r\\nWell then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the\\r\\nweather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\\r\\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\\r\\nBut concentrating all his crow\\'s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\\r\\nstarted me on the errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\\r\\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\\r\\npointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but\\r\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\\r\\nI could see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\\r\\nsee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\\r\\nthough, and there\\'s a squall coming up, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\\r\\ngo round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can\\'t ye see the world\\r\\nwhere you stand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\\r\\nthe Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\\r\\nthis I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\\r\\nhis willingness to ship me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\\r\\nalong with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\r\\nsurprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\\r\\nwith Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\\r\\nother shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\\r\\na crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\\r\\nwards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\\r\\nplank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\\r\\ntheir money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\\r\\napproved state stocks bringing in good interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\\r\\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\\r\\nto this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\\r\\nthe peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\\r\\nmodified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\\r\\nthese same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\\r\\nwhale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\\r\\nvengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\\r\\nScripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\\r\\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\\r\\nthe Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\\r\\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\\r\\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\\r\\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\\r\\nwhen these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\\r\\nwith a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\\r\\nstillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\\r\\nwaters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\\r\\nled to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\\r\\nnature\\'s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\\r\\nvoluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\\r\\nhelp from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\\r\\nlanguage--that man makes one in a whole nation\\'s census--a mighty\\r\\npageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\\r\\ndetract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\\r\\ncircumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\\r\\nat the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\\r\\nso through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\\r\\nall mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\\r\\nwith such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\\r\\nindeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\\r\\nQuaker, modified by individual circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\\r\\nwhaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\\r\\nare called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\\r\\nthings the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\\r\\noriginally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\\r\\nQuakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\\r\\nunclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\\r\\nmoved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\\r\\naltered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\\r\\nwas there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\\r\\nPeleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\\r\\nagainst land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\\r\\nAtlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\\r\\nhad he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\\r\\nleviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\\r\\nthe pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\\r\\nnot know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\\r\\nhe had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\\r\\nman\\'s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\\r\\nThis world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\\r\\nclothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\\r\\nwaistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\\r\\nand finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\\r\\nhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\\r\\ngoodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\\r\\nreceiving of his well-earned income.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\r\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\r\\ntask-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\r\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\\r\\ncrew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\\r\\nhospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\\r\\nfor a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\\r\\nleast.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\\r\\nsomehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\\r\\nout of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\\r\\neye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\\r\\nyou could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\\r\\nwork like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\\r\\nidleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\\r\\nembodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\\r\\ncarried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\\r\\neconomical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\r\\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\\r\\ndecks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\\r\\nsat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\\r\\nbroad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\\r\\ndrab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\\r\\nseemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\\r\\nbeen studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\r\\ncertain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\r\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\\r\\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\\r\\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\\r\\nPeleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\\r\\nsaid nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\\r\\nchest, and drawing forth the ship\\'s articles, placed pen and ink\\r\\nbefore him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\\r\\nit was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\\r\\nwilling to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\\r\\nwhaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\\r\\ncaptain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\\r\\nthese lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\\r\\nto the respective duties of the ship\\'s company.  I was also aware\\r\\nthat being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\\r\\nlarge; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\\r\\nship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\\r\\nhad heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\\r\\n275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\\r\\nmight eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\\r\\ncall a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\\r\\na lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\\r\\nout on it, not to speak of my three years\\' beef and board, for which\\r\\nI would not have to pay one stiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\r\\nfortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\\r\\nthose that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\\r\\ncontent if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\\r\\nputting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\\r\\nthought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\\r\\nhave been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\\r\\nof a broad-shouldered make.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\r\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\\r\\nheard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\\r\\nBildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\\r\\ntherefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\\r\\nleft nearly the whole management of the ship\\'s affairs to these two.\\r\\nAnd I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\\r\\ndeal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\\r\\nboard the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\\r\\nBible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\\r\\nto mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\\r\\nsurprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\\r\\nproceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\\r\\nout of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\\r\\nwhere moth--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d\\'ye say, what lay\\r\\nshall we give this young man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh wouldn\\'t be too much, would it?--\\'where moth and rust\\r\\ndo corrupt, but LAY--\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\\r\\none, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\\r\\ncorrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\\r\\nfrom the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\\r\\nlandsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\\r\\ncome to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\\r\\nthan seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\\r\\nat the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\\r\\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\\r\\nlifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\\r\\nis, there will your heart be also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\\r\\nye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\\r\\nthe duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\\r\\norphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\\r\\nlabors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\\r\\nwidows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\\r\\nCaptain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\\r\\ncabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\\r\\nthese matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\\r\\nwould be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\\r\\nround Cape Horn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\\r\\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\\'t tell; but as thou art\\r\\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\\r\\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\\r\\nfoundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\\r\\nye insult me.  It\\'s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature\\r\\nthat he\\'s bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\\r\\nto me, and start my soul-bolts, but I\\'ll--I\\'ll--yes, I\\'ll swallow a\\r\\nlive goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\\r\\ncanting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\\r\\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\r\\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\\r\\nall idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\r\\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\\r\\nwho, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\\r\\nawakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\\r\\non the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\\r\\nintention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\\r\\nand his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\\r\\nthere seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\\r\\nthough he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\\r\\nhe whistled at last--\"the squall\\'s gone off to leeward, I think.\\r\\nBildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\\r\\nwill ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That\\'s he; thank\\r\\nye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael\\'s thy name, didn\\'t ye\\r\\nsay?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\\r\\nlay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\\r\\ntoo--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we\\'ll look at him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\\r\\nin which he had again been burying himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\\r\\nwhaled it any?\" turning to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, bring him along then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\\r\\nI had done a good morning\\'s work, and that the Pequod was the\\r\\nidentical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\\r\\nthe Cape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\\r\\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\\r\\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\\r\\nand receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\\r\\nvisible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\\r\\nso prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\\r\\nthat if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\\r\\nthat sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\\r\\nbut leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\\r\\nis always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\\r\\nyourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\\r\\ninquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It\\'s all right enough;\\r\\nthou art shipped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don\\'t know\\r\\nexactly what\\'s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\\r\\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don\\'t look so.  In fact, he ain\\'t\\r\\nsick; but no, he isn\\'t well either.  Any how, young man, he won\\'t\\r\\nalways see me, so I don\\'t suppose he will thee.  He\\'s a queer man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou\\'lt like him\\r\\nwell enough; no fear, no fear.  He\\'s a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab; doesn\\'t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\\r\\nmay well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\\'s above the common;\\r\\nAhab\\'s been in colleges, as well as \\'mong the cannibals; been used to\\r\\ndeeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\\r\\nstranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\\r\\nthat out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain\\'t Captain Bildad; no, and he\\r\\nain\\'t Captain Peleg; HE\\'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\\r\\nwas a crowned king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\\r\\nthey not lick his blood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\\r\\nin his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\\r\\nboard the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\\r\\nhimself.  \\'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\\r\\nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\\r\\nsquaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\\r\\nprophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\\r\\nsame.  I wish to warn thee.  It\\'s a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\\r\\nI\\'ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\\r\\nman--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\\r\\nman--something like me--only there\\'s a good deal more of him.  Aye,\\r\\naye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\\r\\npassage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\\r\\nthe sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\\r\\nabout, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\\r\\nhis leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he\\'s been a kind of\\r\\nmoody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\\r\\noff.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\\r\\nit\\'s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\\r\\none.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\\r\\nhappens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\\r\\nthree voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\\r\\nsweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\\r\\nutter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if\\r\\nhe be, Ahab has his humanities!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\\r\\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\\r\\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the\\r\\ntime, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\\r\\nstrange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\\r\\ndescribe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt\\r\\nit; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt\\r\\nimpatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he\\r\\nwas known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in\\r\\nother directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 17\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ramadan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Queequeg\\'s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue\\r\\nall day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for\\r\\nI cherish the greatest respect towards everybody\\'s religious\\r\\nobligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my\\r\\nheart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a\\r\\ntoad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,\\r\\nwho with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,\\r\\nbow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on\\r\\naccount of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\\r\\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\\r\\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\\r\\nsubjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\\r\\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?\\r\\nQueequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to\\r\\nbe content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would\\r\\nnot avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us\\r\\nall--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow\\r\\ndreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\\r\\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\\r\\nbut no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  \"I say,\\r\\nQueequeg! why don\\'t you speak?  It\\'s I--Ishmael.\"  But all remained\\r\\nstill as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such\\r\\nabundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I\\r\\nlooked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner\\r\\nof the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister\\r\\none.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line\\r\\nof the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting\\r\\nagainst the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\\'s harpoon, which the\\r\\nlandlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting\\r\\nto the chamber.  That\\'s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since\\r\\nthe harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without\\r\\nit, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still.  Something must have happened.\\r\\nApoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly\\r\\nresisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the\\r\\nfirst person I met--the chamber-maid.  \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I\\r\\nthought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after\\r\\nbreakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and\\r\\nit\\'s been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had\\r\\nboth gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,\\r\\nma\\'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"--and with these\\r\\ncries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\\r\\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\\r\\noccupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black\\r\\nboy meantime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it?  Run for God\\'s sake, and\\r\\nfetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he\\'s had a\\r\\nstroke; depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\\r\\nup stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the\\r\\nmustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, young man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get the axe!  For God\\'s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\\r\\npry it open!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the\\r\\nvinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you\\r\\ntalking about prying open any of my doors?\"--and with that she seized\\r\\nmy arm.  \"What\\'s the matter with you?  What\\'s the matter with you,\\r\\nshipmate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\\r\\nthe whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side\\r\\nof her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No!  I\\r\\nhaven\\'t seen it since I put it there.\"  Running to a little closet\\r\\nunder the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told\\r\\nme that Queequeg\\'s harpoon was missing.  \"He\\'s killed himself,\" she\\r\\ncried.  \"It\\'s unfort\\'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another\\r\\ncounterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my\\r\\nhouse.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where\\'s that girl?--there, Betty,\\r\\ngo to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--\"no\\r\\nsuicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;\"--might as\\r\\nwell kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his\\r\\nghost!  What\\'s that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\\r\\nopen the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t allow it; I won\\'t have my premises spoiled.  Go for the\\r\\nlocksmith, there\\'s one about a mile from here.  But avast!\" putting\\r\\nher hand in her side-pocket, \"here\\'s a key that\\'ll fit, I guess;\\r\\nlet\\'s see.\"  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!\\r\\nQueequeg\\'s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have to burst it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a\\r\\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again\\r\\nvowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and\\r\\nwith a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\\r\\nagainst the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\\r\\nheavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;\\r\\nright in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding\\r\\nYojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other\\r\\nway, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, going up to him, \"Queequeg, what\\'s the matter\\r\\nwith you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hain\\'t been a sittin\\' so all day, has he?\" said the landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\\r\\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was\\r\\nalmost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally\\r\\nconstrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so\\r\\nfor upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular\\r\\nmeals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Hussey,\" said I, \"he\\'s ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you\\r\\nplease, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\\r\\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he\\r\\ncould do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move\\r\\na peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my\\r\\npresence in the slightest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;\\r\\ndo they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be\\r\\nso; yes, it\\'s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him\\r\\nrest; he\\'ll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can\\'t last for\\r\\never, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don\\'t\\r\\nbelieve it\\'s very punctual then.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the\\r\\nlong stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding\\r\\nvoyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a\\r\\nschooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic\\r\\nOcean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly\\r\\neleven o\\'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\\r\\nthis time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\\r\\ntermination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\\r\\nnot stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\\r\\ndownright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half\\r\\nthe night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\\r\\nhave some supper.  You\\'ll starve; you\\'ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\"\\r\\nBut not a word did he reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\\r\\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous\\r\\nto turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over\\r\\nhim, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\\r\\nhis ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\\r\\nnot get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\\r\\nmere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\\r\\nuneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\\r\\nreally wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\\r\\nwith a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable\\r\\nRamadan!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\\r\\nof day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\\r\\nif he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\\r\\nglimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\\r\\njoints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\\r\\npressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\\'s\\r\\nreligion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or\\r\\ninsult any other person, because that other person don\\'t believe it\\r\\nalso.  But when a man\\'s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\\r\\npositive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\\r\\nuncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that\\r\\nindividual aside and argue the point with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into\\r\\nbed now, and lie and listen to me.\"  I then went on, beginning with\\r\\nthe rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\\r\\nthe various religions of the present time, during which time I\\r\\nlabored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\\r\\nprolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\\r\\nnonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\\r\\nshort, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\\r\\ntoo, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\\r\\nsagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\\r\\nso deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\\r\\nargued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\\r\\nand all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\\r\\nThis is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\\r\\nmelancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,\\r\\nsaid I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\\r\\nundigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\\r\\nhereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\\r\\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\\r\\nin.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\\r\\ngreat feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\\r\\nbattle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\\r\\no\\'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\\r\\nthe inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\\r\\nwho had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\\r\\ncustom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\\r\\nthe slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\\r\\nthey were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\\r\\na pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\\r\\ntheir mouths, were sent round with the victor\\'s compliments to all\\r\\nhis friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\\r\\nturkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\r\\nimpression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\\r\\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\\r\\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\\r\\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\\r\\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\\r\\nreligion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\\r\\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\\r\\nsuch a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical\\r\\npagan piety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\\r\\nhearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady\\r\\nshould not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out\\r\\nto board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with\\r\\nhalibut bones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 18\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,\\r\\nQueequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice\\r\\nloudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my\\r\\nfriend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no\\r\\ncannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their\\r\\npapers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\" said I, now jumping on the\\r\\nbulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"he must show his papers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head\\r\\nfrom behind Peleg\\'s, out of the wigwam.  \"He must show that he\\'s\\r\\nconverted.  Son of darkness,\" he added, turning to Queequeg, \"art\\r\\nthou at present in communion with any Christian church?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said I, \"he\\'s a member of the first Congregational Church.\"\\r\\nHere be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket\\r\\nships at last come to be converted into the churches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First Congregational Church,\" cried Bildad, \"what! that worships in\\r\\nDeacon Deuteronomy Coleman\\'s meeting-house?\" and so saying, taking\\r\\nout his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\\r\\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\\r\\nwigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look\\r\\nat Queequeg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long hath he been a member?\" he then said, turning to me; \"not\\r\\nvery long, I rather guess, young man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Peleg, \"and he hasn\\'t been baptized right either, or it\\r\\nwould have washed some of that devil\\'s blue off his face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do tell, now,\" cried Bildad, \"is this Philistine a regular member of\\r\\nDeacon Deuteronomy\\'s meeting?  I never saw him going there, and I\\r\\npass it every Lord\\'s day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,\" said\\r\\nI; \"all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First\\r\\nCongregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Young man,\" said Bildad sternly, \"thou art skylarking with\\r\\nme--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee mean?\\r\\nanswer me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.  \"I mean, sir, the same\\r\\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\\r\\nand Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\\'s son and soul of\\r\\nus belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\\r\\nworshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish\\r\\nsome queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we\\r\\nall join hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Splice, thou mean\\'st SPLICE hands,\" cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\\r\\n\"Young man, you\\'d better ship for a missionary, instead of a\\r\\nfore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.  Deacon\\r\\nDeuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn\\'t beat it, and he\\'s\\r\\nreckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the\\r\\npapers.  I say, tell Quohog there--what\\'s that you call him? tell\\r\\nQuohog to step along.  By the great anchor, what a harpoon he\\'s got\\r\\nthere! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.  I\\r\\nsay, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head\\r\\nof a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\\r\\nthe bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\\r\\nhanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\\r\\nharpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cap\\'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him?\\r\\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den!\" and taking sharp aim at\\r\\nit, he darted the iron right over old Bildad\\'s broad brim, clean\\r\\nacross the ship\\'s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \"spos-ee him\\r\\nwhale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quick, Bildad,\" said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\\r\\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\\r\\ngangway.  \"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship\\'s papers.  We\\r\\nmust have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.  Look\\r\\nye, Quohog, we\\'ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that\\'s more than\\r\\never was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\\r\\nenrolled among the same ship\\'s company to which I myself belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready\\r\\nfor signing, he turned to me and said, \"I guess, Quohog there don\\'t\\r\\nknow how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign\\r\\nthy name or make thy mark?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\\r\\npart in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the\\r\\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact\\r\\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;\\r\\nso that through Captain Peleg\\'s obstinate mistake touching his\\r\\nappellative, it stood something like this:--\\r\\n\\r\\nQuohog.\\r\\nhis X mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing\\r\\nQueequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge\\r\\npockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,\\r\\nand selecting one entitled \"The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to\\r\\nLose,\" placed it in Queequeg\\'s hands, and then grasping them and the\\r\\nbook with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, \"Son of\\r\\ndarkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship,\\r\\nand feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still\\r\\nclingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,\\r\\nremain not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the\\r\\nhideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;\\r\\noh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad\\'s language,\\r\\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our\\r\\nharpooneer,\" Peleg.  \"Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it\\r\\ntakes the shark out of \\'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint\\r\\npretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest\\r\\nboat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the\\r\\nmeeting, and never came to good.  He got so frightened about his\\r\\nplaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear\\r\\nof after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Peleg!  Peleg!\" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \"thou\\r\\nthyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,\\r\\nPeleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can\\'st thou\\r\\nprate in this ungodly guise.  Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.\\r\\nTell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in\\r\\nthat typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with\\r\\nCaptain Ahab, did\\'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear him, hear him now,\" cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\\r\\nthrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--\"hear him, all of ye.\\r\\nThink of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!\\r\\nDeath and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such\\r\\nan everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking\\r\\nover us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No!\\r\\nno time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab and I\\r\\nwas thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig\\r\\njury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was\\r\\nthinking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,\\r\\nwhere we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\\r\\nsailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.  Now and then he\\r\\nstooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\\r\\notherwise might have been wasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 19\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prophet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from\\r\\nthe water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when\\r\\nthe above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,\\r\\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.  He was\\r\\nbut shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag\\r\\nof a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent small-pox\\r\\nhad in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the\\r\\ncomplicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have\\r\\nbeen dried up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have ye shipped in her?\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\" said I, trying to gain a\\r\\nlittle more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there,\" he said, drawing back his whole\\r\\narm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the\\r\\nfixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"we have just signed the articles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything down there about your souls?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, perhaps you hav\\'n\\'t got any,\" he said quickly.  \"No matter\\r\\nthough, I know many chaps that hav\\'n\\'t got any,--good luck to \\'em;\\r\\nand they are all the better off for it.  A soul\\'s a sort of a fifth\\r\\nwheel to a wagon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HE\\'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that\\r\\nsort in other chaps,\" abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\\r\\nemphasis upon the word HE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"let\\'s go; this fellow has broken loose from\\r\\nsomewhere; he\\'s talking about something and somebody we don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop!\" cried the stranger.  \"Ye said true--ye hav\\'n\\'t seen Old\\r\\nThunder yet, have ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Old Thunder?\" said I, again riveted with the insane\\r\\nearnestness of his manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye\\r\\nhav\\'n\\'t seen him yet, have ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, we hav\\'n\\'t.  He\\'s sick they say, but is getting better, and will\\r\\nbe all right again before long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right again before long!\" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\\r\\nderisive sort of laugh.  \"Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,\\r\\nthen this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did they TELL you about him?  Say that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They didn\\'t tell much of anything about him; only I\\'ve heard that\\r\\nhe\\'s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s true, that\\'s true--yes, both true enough.  But you must jump\\r\\nwhen he gives an order.  Step and growl; growl and go--that\\'s the\\r\\nword with Captain Ahab.  But nothing about that thing that happened\\r\\nto him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days\\r\\nand nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard\\r\\nafore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing\\r\\nabout the silver calabash he spat into?  And nothing about his losing\\r\\nhis leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.  Didn\\'t ye hear a\\r\\nword about them matters and something more, eh?  No, I don\\'t think ye\\r\\ndid; how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.  But\\r\\nhows\\'ever, mayhap, ye\\'ve heard tell about the leg, and how he lost\\r\\nit; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT every one\\r\\nknows a\\'most--I mean they know he\\'s only one leg; and that a\\r\\nparmacetti took the other off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friend,\" said I, \"what all this gibberish of yours is about, I\\r\\ndon\\'t know, and I don\\'t much care; for it seems to me that you must\\r\\nbe a little damaged in the head.  But if you are speaking of Captain\\r\\nAhab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I\\r\\nknow all about the loss of his leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pretty sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\\r\\nstranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\\r\\nlittle, turned and said:--\"Ye\\'ve shipped, have ye?  Names down on the\\r\\npapers?  Well, well, what\\'s signed, is signed; and what\\'s to be, will\\r\\nbe; and then again, perhaps it won\\'t be, after all.  Anyhow, it\\'s\\r\\nall fixed and arranged a\\'ready; and some sailors or other must go\\r\\nwith him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity \\'em!\\r\\nMorning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;\\r\\nI\\'m sorry I stopped ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, friend,\" said I, \"if you have anything important to tell\\r\\nus, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are\\r\\nmistaken in your game; that\\'s all I have to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it\\'s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;\\r\\nyou are just the man for him--the likes of ye.  Morning to ye,\\r\\nshipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there, tell \\'em I\\'ve concluded\\r\\nnot to make one of \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, you can\\'t fool us that way--you can\\'t fool us.\\r\\nIt is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\\r\\ngreat secret in him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morning it is,\" said I.  \"Come along, Queequeg, let\\'s leave this\\r\\ncrazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elijah.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\\r\\nother\\'s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\\r\\nnothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.  But we had not gone\\r\\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\\r\\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\\r\\nthough at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\\r\\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\\r\\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same\\r\\ncorner that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that he was\\r\\ndogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me\\r\\nimagine.  This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,\\r\\nhalf-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me\\r\\nall kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all\\r\\nconnected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;\\r\\nand the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain\\r\\nPeleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the\\r\\nprediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves\\r\\nto sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was\\r\\nreally dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with\\r\\nQueequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.  But Elijah\\r\\npassed on, without seeming to notice us.  This relieved me; and once\\r\\nmore, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a\\r\\nhumbug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 20\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Astir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\\r\\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming\\r\\non board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,\\r\\neverything betokened that the ship\\'s preparations were hurrying to a\\r\\nclose.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his\\r\\nwigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the\\r\\npurchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the\\r\\nhold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day following Queequeg\\'s signing the articles, word was given\\r\\nat all the inns where the ship\\'s company were stopping, that their\\r\\nchests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how\\r\\nsoon the vessel might be sailing.  So Queequeg and I got down our\\r\\ntraps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.  But it\\r\\nseems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship\\r\\ndid not sail for several days.  But no wonder; there was a good deal\\r\\nto be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of,\\r\\nbefore the Pequod was fully equipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives\\r\\nand forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,\\r\\nare indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with\\r\\nwhaling, which necessitates a three-years\\' housekeeping upon the wide\\r\\nocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and\\r\\nbankers.  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet\\r\\nnot by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides\\r\\nthe great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles\\r\\npeculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of\\r\\nreplacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be\\r\\nremembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed\\r\\nto accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss\\r\\nof the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.\\r\\nHence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons,\\r\\nand spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of\\r\\nthe Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,\\r\\nwater, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted, for\\r\\nsome time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of\\r\\ndivers odds and ends of things, both large and small.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\\r\\nBildad\\'s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and\\r\\nindefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed\\r\\nresolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting\\r\\nin the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.  At one time she\\r\\nwould come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward\\'s pantry;\\r\\nanother time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate\\'s desk, where\\r\\nhe kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of\\r\\nsome one\\'s rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her\\r\\nname, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.  And\\r\\nlike a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle\\r\\nabout hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to\\r\\nanything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to\\r\\nall on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was\\r\\nconcerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\\r\\nwell-saved dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming\\r\\non board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand,\\r\\nand a still longer whaling lance in the other.  Nor was Bildad himself\\r\\nnor Captain Peleg at all backward.  As for Bildad, he carried about\\r\\nwith him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh\\r\\narrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.\\r\\nEvery once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,\\r\\nroaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at\\r\\nthe mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\\r\\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\\r\\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions they\\r\\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\\r\\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\\r\\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.  If\\r\\nI had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very\\r\\nplainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this\\r\\nway to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who\\r\\nwas to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out\\r\\nupon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes\\r\\nhappens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly\\r\\nstrives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  And much this\\r\\nway it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\\r\\ncertainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\\r\\nstart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 21\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing Aboard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly six o\\'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when\\r\\nwe drew nigh the wharf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\" said I\\r\\nto Queequeg, \"it can\\'t be shadows; she\\'s off by sunrise, I guess;\\r\\ncome on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\\r\\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\\r\\nhimself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\\r\\ntwilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going aboard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hands off, will you,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself, \"go \\'way!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t going aboard, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but what business is that of yours?  Do you\\r\\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no; I wasn\\'t aware of that,\" said Elijah, slowly and\\r\\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\\r\\nglances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.\\r\\nWe are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not\\r\\nto be detained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s cracked, Queequeg,\" said I, \"come on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holloa!\" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a\\r\\nfew paces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\\r\\nshoulder, said--\"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards\\r\\nthat ship a while ago?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,\\r\\n\"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very dim, very dim,\" said Elijah.  \"Morning to ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\\r\\ntouching my shoulder again, said, \"See if you can find \\'em now, will\\r\\nye?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Find who?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morning to ye! morning to ye!\" he rejoined, again moving off.  \"Oh!\\r\\nI was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it\\'s all\\r\\none, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain\\'t it?\\r\\nGood-bye to ye.  Shan\\'t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it\\'s\\r\\nbefore the Grand Jury.\"  And with these cracked words he finally\\r\\ndeparted, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his\\r\\nfrantic impudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in\\r\\nprofound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked\\r\\nwithin; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\\r\\nGoing forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle\\r\\nopen.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger\\r\\nthere, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole\\r\\nlength upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\\r\\narms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said\\r\\nI, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the\\r\\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\\r\\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\\r\\nmatter, were it not for Elijah\\'s otherwise inexplicable question.\\r\\nBut I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly\\r\\nhinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;\\r\\ntelling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon\\r\\nthe sleeper\\'s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and\\r\\nthen, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracious!  Queequeg, don\\'t sit there,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg, \"my country way; won\\'t hurt\\r\\nhim face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent countenance\\r\\nthen; but how hard he breathes, he\\'s heaving himself; get off,\\r\\nQueequeg, you are heavy, it\\'s grinding the face of the poor.  Get\\r\\noff, Queequeg!  Look, he\\'ll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don\\'t\\r\\nwake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\\r\\nlighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe\\r\\npassing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon\\r\\nquestioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\\r\\nthat, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\\r\\nsorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\\r\\ncustom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\\r\\nfurnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\\r\\neight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\\r\\nalcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\\r\\nbetter than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\\r\\nwalking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\\r\\ndesiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,\\r\\nperhaps in some damp marshy place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\\r\\ntomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\\r\\nsleeper\\'s head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that for, Queequeg?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\\r\\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and\\r\\nsoothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping\\r\\nrigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,\\r\\nit began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;\\r\\nthen seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;\\r\\nthen sat up and rubbed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The\\r\\nCaptain came aboard last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What Captain?--Ahab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who but him indeed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when\\r\\nwe heard a noise on deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holloa!  Starbuck\\'s astir,\" said the rigger.  \"He\\'s a lively chief\\r\\nmate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn\\r\\nto.\"  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and\\r\\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\\r\\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing\\r\\nvarious last things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained\\r\\ninvisibly enshrined within his cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 22\\r\\n\\r\\nMerry Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\\'s\\r\\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\\r\\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\\r\\nher last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this,\\r\\nthe two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and\\r\\nturning to the chief mate, Peleg said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab\\r\\nis all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore,\\r\\neh?  Well, call all hands, then.  Muster \\'em aft here--blast \\'em!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\" said\\r\\nBildad, \"but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,\\r\\nCaptain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on\\r\\nthe quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,\\r\\nas well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no\\r\\nsign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.\\r\\nBut then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary\\r\\nin getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\\r\\nIndeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot\\'s;\\r\\nand as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;\\r\\nespecially as in the merchant service many captains never show\\r\\nthemselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the\\r\\nanchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\\r\\nmerry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for\\r\\ngood with the pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\\r\\nPeleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and\\r\\ncommanding, and not Bildad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered\\r\\nat the main-mast.  \"Mr. Starbuck, drive\\'em aft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,\\r\\nthis whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board\\r\\nthe Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well\\r\\nknown to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!\"--was the next command,\\r\\nand the crew sprang for the handspikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the\\r\\npilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with\\r\\nPeleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the\\r\\nlicensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself\\r\\nmade a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the\\r\\nships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other\\r\\ncraft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking\\r\\nover the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing\\r\\nwhat seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the\\r\\nwindlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in\\r\\nBooble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days\\r\\nprevious, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed\\r\\non board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and\\r\\nCharity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each\\r\\nseaman\\'s berth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\\r\\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he\\r\\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily\\r\\nI paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking\\r\\nof the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a\\r\\ndevil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the\\r\\nthought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of\\r\\nhis seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp\\r\\npoke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition\\r\\nof Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate\\r\\nvicinity.  That was my first kick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared.\\r\\n\"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don\\'t\\r\\nye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with\\r\\nthe red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green\\r\\npants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\"  And so\\r\\nsaying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg\\r\\nvery freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his\\r\\npsalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It\\r\\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged\\r\\ninto night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,\\r\\nwhose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long\\r\\nrows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like\\r\\nthe white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles\\r\\ndepended from the bows.\\r\\n\\r\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\\r\\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\\r\\nfrost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\\r\\nsteady notes were heard,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\\r\\nStand dressed in living green.\\r\\nSo to the Jews old Canaan stood,\\r\\nWhile Jordan rolled between.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.  They\\r\\nwere full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night in\\r\\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,\\r\\nthere was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;\\r\\nand meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by\\r\\nthe spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no\\r\\nlonger.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\\r\\nalongside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\\r\\nat this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,\\r\\nyet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and\\r\\nperilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some\\r\\nthousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which\\r\\nan old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once\\r\\nmore starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath\\r\\nto say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to\\r\\nhim,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious\\r\\nstrides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word\\r\\nthere; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the\\r\\nwide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern\\r\\nContinents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and\\r\\nleft; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically\\r\\ncoiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the\\r\\nhand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically\\r\\nin his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can\\r\\nstand it; yes, I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\\r\\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\\r\\nlantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin\\r\\nto deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief\\r\\nmate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look\\r\\nabout him,--\"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.  Back\\r\\nthe main-yard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come close alongside,\\r\\nnow!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.  Luck to\\r\\nye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye\\r\\nand good luck to ye all--and this day three years I\\'ll have a hot\\r\\nsupper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\" murmured old\\r\\nBildad, almost incoherently.  \"I hope ye\\'ll have fine weather now, so\\r\\nthat Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all\\r\\nhe needs, and ye\\'ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.\\r\\nBe careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don\\'t stave the boats needlessly,\\r\\nye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\\r\\nwithin the year.  Don\\'t forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck,\\r\\nmind that cooper don\\'t waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles\\r\\nare in the green locker!  Don\\'t whale it too much a\\' Lord\\'s days,\\r\\nmen; but don\\'t miss a fair chance either, that\\'s rejecting Heaven\\'s\\r\\ngood gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a\\r\\nlittle leaky, I thought.  If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,\\r\\nbeware of fornication.  Good-bye, good-bye!  Don\\'t keep that cheese\\r\\ntoo long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it\\'ll spoil.  Be careful\\r\\nwith the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!\" and with that,\\r\\nPeleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a\\r\\nscreaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave\\r\\nthree heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the\\r\\nlone Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 23\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lee Shore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded\\r\\nmariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen on that shivering winter\\'s night, the Pequod thrust her\\r\\nvindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see\\r\\nstanding at her helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe\\r\\nand fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a\\r\\nfour years\\' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for\\r\\nstill another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his\\r\\nfeet.  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories\\r\\nyield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of\\r\\nBulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the\\r\\nstorm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.  The\\r\\nport would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is\\r\\nsafety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all\\r\\nthat\\'s kind to our mortalities.  But in that gale, the port, the\\r\\nland, is that ship\\'s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;\\r\\none touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her\\r\\nshudder through and through.  With all her might she crowds all sail\\r\\noff shore; in so doing, fights \\'gainst the very winds that fain would\\r\\nblow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea\\'s landlessness again; for\\r\\nrefuge\\'s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her\\r\\nbitterest foe!\\r\\n\\r\\nKnow ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\\r\\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the\\r\\nintrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;\\r\\nwhile the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on\\r\\nthe treacherous, slavish shore?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\\r\\nindefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling\\r\\ninfinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were\\r\\nsafety!  For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!\\r\\nTerrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take\\r\\nheart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!  Up from the spray\\r\\nof thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 24\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Advocate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of\\r\\nwhaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be\\r\\nregarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable\\r\\npursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of\\r\\nthe injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\\r\\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\\r\\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.\\r\\nIf a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan\\r\\nsociety, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his\\r\\nmerits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if\\r\\nin emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials\\r\\nS.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure\\r\\nwould be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us\\r\\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to\\r\\na butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged\\r\\ntherein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.  Butchers we\\r\\nare, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest\\r\\nbadge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably\\r\\ndelights to honour.  And as for the matter of the alleged\\r\\nuncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into\\r\\ncertain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the\\r\\nwhole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among\\r\\nthe cleanliest things of this tidy earth.  But even granting the\\r\\ncharge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a\\r\\nwhale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those\\r\\nbattle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all\\r\\nladies\\' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the\\r\\npopular conceit of the soldier\\'s profession; let me assure ye that\\r\\nmany a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly\\r\\nrecoil at the apparition of the sperm whale\\'s vast tail, fanning into\\r\\neddies the air over his head.  For what are the comprehensible\\r\\nterrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of\\r\\nGod!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\\r\\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\\r\\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\\r\\nround the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\\r\\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\\'s time have admirals of their whaling\\r\\nfleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense,\\r\\nfit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town\\r\\nsome score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?  Why\\r\\ndid Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in\\r\\nbounties upwards of L1,000,000?  And lastly, how comes it that we\\r\\nwhalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen\\r\\nin the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned\\r\\nby eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the\\r\\nships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year\\r\\nimporting into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How\\r\\ncomes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his\\r\\nlife, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last\\r\\nsixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world,\\r\\ntaken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.\\r\\nOne way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in\\r\\nthemselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,\\r\\nthat whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore\\r\\noffspring themselves pregnant from her womb.  It would be a hopeless,\\r\\nendless task to catalogue all these things.  Let a handful suffice.\\r\\nFor many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting\\r\\nout the remotest and least known parts of the earth.  She has\\r\\nexplored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or\\r\\nVancouver had ever sailed.  If American and European men-of-war\\r\\nnow peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to\\r\\nthe honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them\\r\\nthe way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.  They\\r\\nmay celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your\\r\\nCooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous\\r\\nCaptains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and\\r\\ngreater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their\\r\\nsuccourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,\\r\\nand by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with\\r\\nvirgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and\\r\\nmuskets would not willingly have dared.  All that is made such a\\r\\nflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the\\r\\nlife-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,\\r\\nadventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men\\r\\naccounted unworthy of being set down in the ship\\'s common log.  Ah,\\r\\nthe world!  Oh, the world!\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\\r\\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe\\r\\nand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific\\r\\ncoast.  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous\\r\\npolicy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space\\r\\npermitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at\\r\\nlast eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the\\r\\nyoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in\\r\\nthose parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was\\r\\ngiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman.  After its first\\r\\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned\\r\\nthose shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched\\r\\nthere.  The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\\r\\nMoreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\\r\\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent\\r\\nbiscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.\\r\\nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do\\r\\ncommercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the\\r\\nmissionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive\\r\\nmissionaries to their first destinations.  If that double-bolted\\r\\nland, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone\\r\\nto whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has\\r\\nno aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I\\r\\nready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a\\r\\nsplit helmet every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you\\r\\nwill say.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who\\r\\nwrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And\\r\\nwho composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?  Who, but no\\r\\nless a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,\\r\\ntook down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those\\r\\ntimes!  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?  Who,\\r\\nbut Edmund Burke!\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have\\r\\nno good blood in their veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nNO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something better than royal\\r\\nblood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;\\r\\nafterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of\\r\\nNantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and\\r\\nharpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the\\r\\nbarbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not\\r\\nrespectable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English\\r\\nstatutory law, the whale is declared \"a royal fish.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, that\\'s only nominal!  The whale himself has never figured in any\\r\\ngrand imposing way.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?  In one of the\\r\\nmighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the\\r\\nworld\\'s capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the\\r\\nSyrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed\\r\\nprocession.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real\\r\\ndignity in whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\nNO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  The dignity of our calling the very heavens\\r\\nattest.  Cetus is a constellation in the South!  No more!  Drive\\r\\ndown your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg!\\r\\nNo more!  I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred\\r\\nand fifty whales.  I account that man more honourable than that great\\r\\ncaptain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet\\r\\nundiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real\\r\\nrepute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be\\r\\nunreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon\\r\\nthe whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if,\\r\\nat my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any\\r\\nprecious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the\\r\\nhonour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College\\r\\nand my Harvard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 25\\r\\n\\r\\nPostscript.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\\r\\nsubstantiated facts.  But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\\r\\nshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell\\r\\neloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be\\r\\nblameworthy?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\\r\\nmodern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\\r\\nfunctions is gone through.  There is a saltcellar of state, so\\r\\ncalled, and there may be a castor of state.  How they use the salt,\\r\\nprecisely--who knows?  Certain I am, however, that a king\\'s head is\\r\\nsolemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  Can it\\r\\nbe, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior\\r\\nrun well, as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,\\r\\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in\\r\\ncommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who\\r\\nanoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.  In truth, a\\r\\nmature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has\\r\\nprobably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  As a general rule, he\\r\\ncan\\'t amount to much in his totality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil\\r\\nis used at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor\\r\\nmacassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear\\'s oil, nor train oil, nor\\r\\ncod-liver oil.  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in\\r\\nits unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\\r\\nqueens with coronation stuff!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 26\\r\\n\\r\\nKnights and Squires.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and\\r\\na Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on\\r\\nan icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh\\r\\nbeing hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his\\r\\nlive blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born\\r\\nin some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast\\r\\ndays for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers\\r\\nhad he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\\r\\nsuperfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more\\r\\nthe token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the\\r\\nindication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of\\r\\nthe man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His\\r\\npure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,\\r\\nand embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\\r\\nEgyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\\r\\ncome, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid\\r\\nsun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted\\r\\nto do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to\\r\\nsee there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\\r\\nhad calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose\\r\\nlife for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a\\r\\ntame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\\r\\nfortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\\r\\naffected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the\\r\\nrest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\\r\\nnatural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\\r\\ntherefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\\r\\nsuperstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\\r\\nsomehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\\r\\ninward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\\r\\nwelded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\\r\\nof his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from\\r\\nthe original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to\\r\\nthose latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain\\r\\nthe gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\\r\\nperilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man in my\\r\\nboat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"  By this, he\\r\\nseemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage\\r\\nwas that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered\\r\\nperil, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous\\r\\ncomrade than a coward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as\\r\\ncareful a man as you\\'ll find anywhere in this fishery.\"  But we shall\\r\\nere long see what that word \"careful\" precisely means when used by a\\r\\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\\r\\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\\r\\nall mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that\\r\\nin this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple\\r\\noutfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\\r\\nfoolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\\r\\nafter sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\\r\\npersisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\\r\\ncritical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\\r\\nthem for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck\\r\\nwell knew.  What doom was his own father\\'s?  Where, in the bottomless\\r\\ndeeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\\r\\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck\\r\\nwhich could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\\r\\nextreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\\r\\norganized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\\r\\nhad; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\\r\\nengendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\\r\\nwould break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\\r\\nAnd brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,\\r\\nvisible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in\\r\\nthe conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\\r\\nirrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\\r\\nterrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you\\r\\nfrom the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\\r\\nabasement of poor Starbuck\\'s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\\r\\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to\\r\\nexpose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as\\r\\njoint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there\\r\\nmay be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,\\r\\nis so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that\\r\\nover any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to\\r\\nthrow their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel\\r\\nwithin ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all\\r\\nthe outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the\\r\\nundraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at\\r\\nsuch a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the\\r\\npermitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the\\r\\ndignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no\\r\\nrobed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields\\r\\na pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all\\r\\nhands, radiates without end from God; Himself!  The great God\\r\\nabsolute!  The centre and circumference of all democracy!  His\\r\\nomnipresence, our divine equality!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\\r\\nhereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them\\r\\ntragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased,\\r\\namong them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if\\r\\nI shall touch that workman\\'s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall\\r\\nspread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all\\r\\nmortal critics bear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality,\\r\\nwhich hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!\\r\\nBear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to\\r\\nthe swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst\\r\\nclothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and\\r\\npaupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson\\r\\nfrom the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst\\r\\nthunder him higher than a throne!  Thou who, in all Thy mighty,\\r\\nearthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the\\r\\nkingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 27\\r\\n\\r\\nKnights and Squires.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb was the second mate.  He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\\r\\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.  A\\r\\nhappy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they\\r\\ncame with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent\\r\\ncrisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman\\r\\njoiner engaged for the year.  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he\\r\\npresided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but\\r\\na dinner, and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular\\r\\nabout the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an\\r\\nold stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the\\r\\nwhale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying\\r\\nlance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.  He\\r\\nwould hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the\\r\\nmost exasperated monster.  Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted\\r\\nthe jaws of death into an easy chair.  What he thought of death\\r\\nitself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,\\r\\nmight be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that\\r\\nway after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took\\r\\nit to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir\\r\\nthemselves there, about something which he would find out when he\\r\\nobeyed the order, and not sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\\r\\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\\r\\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their\\r\\npacks; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of\\r\\nhis; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his\\r\\nshort, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\\r\\nYou would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\\r\\nwithout his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes\\r\\nthere ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;\\r\\nand, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,\\r\\nlighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading\\r\\nthem again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead\\r\\nof first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of\\r\\nhis peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\\r\\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\\r\\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as\\r\\nin time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\\r\\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\\r\\ntribulations, Stubb\\'s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\\r\\ndisinfecting agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\\'s Vineyard.\\r\\nA short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning\\r\\nwhales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had\\r\\npersonally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a\\r\\nsort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever\\r\\nencountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for\\r\\nthe many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead\\r\\nto anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from\\r\\nencountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was\\r\\nbut a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring\\r\\nonly a little circumvention and some small application of time and\\r\\ntrouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious\\r\\nfearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of\\r\\nwhales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years\\'\\r\\nvoyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length\\r\\nof time.  As a carpenter\\'s nails are divided into wrought nails and\\r\\ncut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one\\r\\nof the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called\\r\\nhim King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be\\r\\nwell likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic\\r\\nwhalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\\r\\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy\\r\\nconcussions of those battering seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous\\r\\nmen.  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which\\r\\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\\r\\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,\\r\\nbeing armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a\\r\\npicked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of\\r\\njavelins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a\\r\\nGothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or\\r\\nharpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh\\r\\nlance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the\\r\\nassault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a\\r\\nclose intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in\\r\\nthis place we set down who the Pequod\\'s harpooneers were, and to what\\r\\nheadsman each of them belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had\\r\\nselected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\\r\\npromontory of Martha\\'s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\\r\\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\\r\\nneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\\r\\nharpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\\r\\nGay-Headers.  Tashtego\\'s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek\\r\\nbones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their\\r\\nlargeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this\\r\\nsufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of\\r\\nthose proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England\\r\\nmoose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\\r\\nBut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\\r\\nwoodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the\\r\\nsea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible\\r\\narrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\\r\\nlimbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of\\r\\nthe earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son\\r\\nof the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the\\r\\nsecond mate\\'s squire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\\r\\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.\\r\\nSuspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\\r\\nsailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the\\r\\ntop-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\\r\\nshipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native\\r\\ncoast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,\\r\\nNantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and\\r\\nhaving now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the\\r\\nships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they\\r\\nshipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\\r\\ngiraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in\\r\\nhis socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and\\r\\na white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce\\r\\nof a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\\r\\nDaggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man\\r\\nbeside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod\\'s company, be it said,\\r\\nthat at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\\r\\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\\r\\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the\\r\\nsame with the American whale fishery as with the American army and\\r\\nmilitary and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in\\r\\nthe construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I\\r\\nsay, because in all these cases the native American liberally\\r\\nprovides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying\\r\\nthe muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the\\r\\nAzores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to\\r\\naugment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.\\r\\nIn like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London,\\r\\nput in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of\\r\\ntheir crew.  Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.\\r\\nHow it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best\\r\\nwhalemen.  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES\\r\\ntoo, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but\\r\\neach ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.  Yet now,\\r\\nfederated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!  An\\r\\nAnacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all\\r\\nthe ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the\\r\\nworld\\'s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them\\r\\never come back.  Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went\\r\\nbefore.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod\\'s forecastle, ye shall\\r\\nere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal\\r\\ntime, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid\\r\\nstrike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a\\r\\ncoward here, hailed a hero there!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 28\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\\r\\nseen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other at the\\r\\nwatches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they\\r\\nseemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes\\r\\nissued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that\\r\\nafter all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.  Yes, their\\r\\nsupreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any\\r\\neyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\\r\\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first\\r\\nvague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion\\r\\nof the sea, became almost a perturbation.  This was strangely\\r\\nheightened at times by the ragged Elijah\\'s diabolical incoherences\\r\\nuninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have\\r\\nbefore conceived of.  But poorly could I withstand them, much as in\\r\\nother moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities\\r\\nof that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever it was of\\r\\napprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet\\r\\nwhenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all\\r\\nwarrantry to cherish such emotions.  For though the harpooneers, with\\r\\nthe great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and\\r\\nmotley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my\\r\\nprevious experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed\\r\\nthis--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very\\r\\nnature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so\\r\\nabandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the three\\r\\nchief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly\\r\\ncalculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence\\r\\nand cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,\\r\\nmore likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,\\r\\ncould not readily be found, and they were every one of them\\r\\nAmericans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being\\r\\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\\r\\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\\r\\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we\\r\\nsailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its\\r\\nintolerable weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,\\r\\nbut still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when\\r\\nwith a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a\\r\\nvindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted\\r\\nto the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled\\r\\nmy glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.\\r\\nReality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his\\r\\nquarter-deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\\r\\nrecovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,\\r\\nwhen the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\\r\\nconsuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\\r\\nrobustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\\r\\nand shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini\\'s cast Perseus.\\r\\nThreading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\\r\\ndown one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\\r\\ndisappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly\\r\\nwhitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the\\r\\nstraight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning\\r\\ntearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\\r\\nand grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\\r\\nsoil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether\\r\\nthat mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\\r\\ndesperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,\\r\\nthroughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,\\r\\nespecially by the mates.  But once Tashtego\\'s senior, an old Gay-Head\\r\\nIndian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\\r\\nfull forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\\r\\ncame upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\\r\\nelemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\\r\\nnegatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\\r\\nwho, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\\r\\nlaid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\\r\\nimmemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\\r\\npreternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor\\r\\nseriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab\\r\\nshould be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he\\r\\nmuttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,\\r\\nwould find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\\r\\nlivid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I\\r\\nhardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing\\r\\nto the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had\\r\\npreviously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned\\r\\nfrom the polished bone of the sperm whale\\'s jaw.  \"Aye, he was\\r\\ndismasted off Japan,\" said the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like\\r\\nhis dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for\\r\\nit.  He has a quiver of \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\\r\\nof the Pequod\\'s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\\r\\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\\r\\nplank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\\r\\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\\r\\nbeyond the ship\\'s ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\\r\\nfirmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\\r\\nfixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\\r\\nspoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\\r\\nminutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\\r\\nnot painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\\r\\nnot only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\\r\\ncrucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\\r\\ndignity of some mighty woe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\\r\\ncabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\\r\\neither standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\\r\\nhad; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\\r\\nindeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\\r\\na recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\\r\\ndead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\\r\\nby and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\\r\\nair; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\\r\\nlast sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\\r\\nthe Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\\r\\nnearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were\\r\\nfully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of\\r\\nhimself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that\\r\\none interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his\\r\\nbrow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves\\r\\nupon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\\r\\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\\r\\nfrom his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April\\r\\nand May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the\\r\\nbarest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send\\r\\nforth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;\\r\\nso Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of\\r\\nthat girlish air.  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom\\r\\nof a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 29\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now\\r\\nwent rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\\r\\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\\r\\nTropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\\r\\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\\r\\nup--flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights\\r\\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\\r\\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden\\r\\nhelmeted suns!  For sleeping man, \\'twas hard to choose between such\\r\\nwinsome days and such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of\\r\\nthat unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to\\r\\nthe outward world.  Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when\\r\\nthe still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals\\r\\nas the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these\\r\\nsubtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab\\'s texture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the\\r\\nless man has to do with aught that looks like death.  Among\\r\\nsea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths\\r\\nto visit the night-cloaked deck.  It was so with Ahab; only that now,\\r\\nof late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly\\r\\nspeaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to\\r\\nthe planks.  \"It feels like going down into one\\'s tomb,\"--he would\\r\\nmutter to himself--\"for an old captain like me to be descending this\\r\\nnarrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night\\r\\nwere set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band\\r\\nbelow; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the\\r\\nsailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some\\r\\ncautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their\\r\\nslumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin\\r\\nto prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the\\r\\ncabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the\\r\\niron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some considering touch of\\r\\nhumanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained\\r\\nfrom patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,\\r\\nseeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have\\r\\nbeen the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their\\r\\ndreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.  But once,\\r\\nthe mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with\\r\\nheavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to\\r\\nmainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a\\r\\ncertain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain\\r\\nAhab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but\\r\\nthere might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something\\r\\nindistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion\\r\\ninto it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab\\r\\nthen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\" said Ahab, \"that thou wouldst wad me\\r\\nthat fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.  Below to thy nightly\\r\\ngrave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the\\r\\nfilling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\r\\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\\r\\n\"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\\r\\nlike it, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving\\r\\naway, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; not yet,\" said Stubb, emboldened, \"I will not tamely be\\r\\ncalled a dog, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and\\r\\nbegone, or I\\'ll clear the world of thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors\\r\\nin his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\"\\r\\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\\r\\n\"It\\'s very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\\'t well know\\r\\nwhether to go back and strike him, or--what\\'s that?--down here on my\\r\\nknees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;\\r\\nbut it would be the first time I ever DID pray.  It\\'s queer; very\\r\\nqueer; and he\\'s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he\\'s about the\\r\\nqueerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.  How he flashed at me!--his\\r\\neyes like powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway there\\'s something on his\\r\\nmind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.\\r\\nHe aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the\\r\\ntwenty-four; and he don\\'t sleep then.  Didn\\'t that Dough-Boy, the\\r\\nsteward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man\\'s\\r\\nhammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the\\r\\nfoot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort\\r\\nof frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?  A hot old\\r\\nman!  I guess he\\'s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it\\'s\\r\\na kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.  Well, well;\\r\\nI don\\'t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He\\'s\\r\\nfull of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every\\r\\nnight, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\\'s that for, I should\\r\\nlike to know?  Who\\'s made appointments with him in the hold?  Ain\\'t\\r\\nthat queer, now?  But there\\'s no telling, it\\'s the old game--Here\\r\\ngoes for a snooze.  Damn me, it\\'s worth a fellow\\'s while to be born\\r\\ninto the world, if only to fall right asleep.  And now that I think\\r\\nof it, that\\'s about the first thing babies do, and that\\'s a sort of\\r\\nqueer, too.  Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of \\'em.\\r\\nBut that\\'s against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh\\r\\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes\\r\\nagain.  But how\\'s that? didn\\'t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me\\r\\nten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He\\r\\nmight as well have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick\\r\\nme, and I didn\\'t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow,\\r\\nsomehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.  What the devil\\'s the\\r\\nmatter with me?  I don\\'t stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of\\r\\nthat old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.  By the Lord, I\\r\\nmust have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--but the only way\\'s\\r\\nto stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I\\'ll\\r\\nsee how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 30\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\\r\\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\\r\\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\\r\\nhis pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the\\r\\nstool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\\r\\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.  How could\\r\\none look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\\r\\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the\\r\\nplank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was\\r\\nAhab.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth\\r\\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.\\r\\n\"How now,\" he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \"this\\r\\nsmoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if\\r\\nthy charm be gone!  Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not\\r\\npleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to\\r\\nwindward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,\\r\\nmy final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What\\r\\nbusiness have I with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for\\r\\nsereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not\\r\\namong torn iron-grey locks like mine.  I\\'ll smoke no more--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed in\\r\\nthe waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking\\r\\npipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 31\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Mab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man\\'s\\r\\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\\r\\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!\\r\\nAnd then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool,\\r\\nkept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know\\r\\nhow curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I\\r\\nsomehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not\\r\\nmuch of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  \\'Why,\\' thinks I, \\'what\\'s the\\r\\nrow?  It\\'s not a real leg, only a false leg.\\'  And there\\'s a mighty\\r\\ndifference between a living thump and a dead thump.  That\\'s what\\r\\nmakes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear\\r\\nthan a blow from a cane.  The living member--that makes the living\\r\\ninsult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,\\r\\nwhile I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so\\r\\nconfoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was\\r\\nthinking to myself, \\'what\\'s his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone\\r\\ncane.  Yes,\\' thinks I, \\'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact,\\r\\nonly a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.  Besides,\\'\\r\\nthinks I, \\'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a\\r\\nsmall sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,\\r\\nTHERE\\'S a devilish broad insult.  But this insult is whittled down to\\r\\na point only.\\'  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.\\r\\nWhile I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired\\r\\nold merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and\\r\\nslews me round.  \\'What are you \\'bout?\\' says he.  Slid! man, but I was\\r\\nfrightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the\\r\\nfright.  \\'What am I about?\\' says I at last.  \\'And what business is\\r\\nthat of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do YOU want a\\r\\nkick?\\'  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\\r\\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\\r\\nhad for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man,\\r\\nhis stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.  Says\\r\\nI, on second thoughts, \\'I guess I won\\'t kick you, old fellow.\\'  \\'Wise\\r\\nStubb,\\' said he, \\'wise Stubb;\\' and kept muttering it all the time, a\\r\\nsort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn\\'t\\r\\ngoing to stop saying over his \\'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\\' I thought I\\r\\nmight as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.  But I had only just\\r\\nlifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \\'Stop that kicking!\\'\\r\\n\\'Halloa,\\' says I, \\'what\\'s the matter now, old fellow?\\'  \\'Look ye\\r\\nhere,\\' says he; \\'let\\'s argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,\\r\\ndidn\\'t he?\\'  \\'Yes, he did,\\' says I--\\'right HERE it was.\\'  \\'Very\\r\\ngood,\\' says he--\\'he used his ivory leg, didn\\'t he?\\'  \\'Yes, he did,\\'\\r\\nsays I.  \\'Well then,\\' says he, \\'wise Stubb, what have you to complain\\r\\nof?  Didn\\'t he kick with right good will? it wasn\\'t a common pitch\\r\\npine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked by a great man,\\r\\nand with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It\\'s an honour; I consider it\\r\\nan honour.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England the greatest lords\\r\\nthink it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made\\r\\ngarter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by\\r\\nold Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say; BE kicked by\\r\\nhim; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you\\r\\ncan\\'t help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don\\'t you see that pyramid?\\'  With\\r\\nthat, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\\r\\nswim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\\r\\nhammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be; may be.  But it\\'s made a wise man of me, Flask.  D\\'ye see\\r\\nAhab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best\\r\\nthing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to\\r\\nhim, whatever he says.  Halloa!  What\\'s that he shouts?  Hark!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales\\r\\nhereabouts!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain\\'t there a small drop of\\r\\nsomething queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye mark that,\\r\\nman?  Look ye--there\\'s something special in the wind.  Stand by for\\r\\nit, Flask.  Ahab has that that\\'s bloody on his mind.  But, mum; he\\r\\ncomes this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 32\\r\\n\\r\\nCetology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be\\r\\nlost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.  Ere that come to pass;\\r\\nere the Pequod\\'s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled\\r\\nhulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a\\r\\nmatter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding\\r\\nof the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all\\r\\nsorts which are to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,\\r\\nthat I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.  The\\r\\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\\r\\nessayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\\r\\nCetology,\" says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the\\r\\ninquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and\\r\\nfamilies....  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this\\r\\nanimal\" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\"\\r\\n\"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.\"  \"A field\\r\\nstrewn with thorns.\"  \"All these incomplete indications but serve to\\r\\ntorture us naturalists.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and\\r\\nLesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of\\r\\nreal knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and\\r\\nso in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.\\r\\nMany are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,\\r\\nwho have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a\\r\\nfew:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir\\r\\nThomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;\\r\\nArtedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest;\\r\\nBaron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;\\r\\nBennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and\\r\\nthe Rev.  T.  Cheever.  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all\\r\\nthese have written, the above cited extracts will show.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\\r\\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\\r\\nharpooneer and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate\\r\\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\\r\\nauthority.  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\\r\\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost\\r\\nunworthy mentioning.  And here be it said, that the Greenland whale\\r\\nis an usurper upon the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any\\r\\nmeans the largest of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of\\r\\nhis claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years\\r\\nback, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and\\r\\nwhich ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few\\r\\nscientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every\\r\\nway complete.  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in\\r\\nthe great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland\\r\\nwhale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But\\r\\nthe time has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing\\r\\nCross; hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is\\r\\ndeposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\\r\\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\\r\\ndegree succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale\\'s and\\r\\nBennett\\'s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea\\r\\nwhale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter\\r\\ntouching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily\\r\\nsmall; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though\\r\\nmostly confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the\\r\\nsperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any\\r\\nliterature.  Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\\r\\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\\r\\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\\r\\nlaborers.  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\\r\\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors.  I promise nothing complete;\\r\\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\\r\\nreason infallibly be faulty.  I shall not pretend to a minute\\r\\nanatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at\\r\\nleast--to much of any description.  My object here is simply to\\r\\nproject the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the\\r\\narchitect, not the builder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\\r\\nPost-Office is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea\\r\\nafter them; to have one\\'s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\\r\\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.  What am\\r\\nI that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!  The awful\\r\\ntauntings in Job might well appal me.  \"Will he the (leviathan) make\\r\\na covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!  But I have\\r\\nswam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do\\r\\nwith whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will\\r\\ntry.  There are some preliminaries to settle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\\r\\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\\r\\nit still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\\r\\nSystem of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\\r\\nthe whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\\r\\nto the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\\r\\nLinnaeus\\'s express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\\r\\nthe same seas with the Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\\r\\nfrom the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\\r\\nbilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\\r\\nears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\\r\\nlege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\\r\\nSimeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\\r\\nin a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\\r\\nset forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\\r\\nthey were humbug.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\\r\\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\\r\\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\\r\\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\\r\\ngiven you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\\r\\nblood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\r\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\\r\\na whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\\r\\nhim.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\\r\\nmeditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\\r\\na fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\\r\\ndefinition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\\r\\nany one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\\r\\nnot a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\\r\\nspouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\\r\\nassumes a horizontal position.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\\r\\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\\r\\nwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\\r\\nhand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\\r\\nalien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\\r\\nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\\r\\nthe grand divisions of the entire whale host.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins\\r\\nand Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\\r\\nincluded by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish\\r\\nare a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of\\r\\nrivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,\\r\\nI deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with\\r\\ntheir passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\\r\\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\\r\\nall, both small and large.\\r\\n\\r\\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,\\r\\nthe GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--I. The\\r\\nSPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the\\r\\nHUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM\\r\\nWHALE.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the\\r\\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\\r\\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\\r\\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of\\r\\nthe Long Words.  He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the\\r\\nglobe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most\\r\\nmajestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;\\r\\nhe being the only creature from which that valuable substance,\\r\\nspermaceti, is obtained.  All his peculiarities will, in many other\\r\\nplaces, be enlarged upon.  It is chiefly with his name that I now\\r\\nhave to do.  Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries\\r\\nago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own\\r\\nproper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained\\r\\nfrom the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was\\r\\npopularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the\\r\\none then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was\\r\\nthe idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of\\r\\nthe Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally\\r\\nexpresses.  In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,\\r\\nnot being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.  It\\r\\nwas only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of\\r\\nrhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of\\r\\nspermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the\\r\\ndealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely\\r\\nsignificant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation must at last\\r\\nhave come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti\\r\\nwas really derived.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is\\r\\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\\r\\nhunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\\r\\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as \"whale oil,\" an inferior\\r\\narticle in commerce.  Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately\\r\\ndesignated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland\\r\\nWhale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\\r\\nWhale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the\\r\\nspecies thus multitudinously baptised.  What then is the whale, which\\r\\nI include in the second species of my Folios?  It is the Great\\r\\nMysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the\\r\\nEnglish whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the\\r\\nGrowlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is the whale which for more than\\r\\ntwo centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the\\r\\nArctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long\\r\\npursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\\' West\\r\\nCoast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right\\r\\nWhale Cruising Grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\\r\\nEnglish and the right whale of the Americans.  But they precisely\\r\\nagree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a\\r\\nsingle determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.\\r\\nIt is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive\\r\\ndifferences, that some departments of natural history become so\\r\\nrepellingly intricate.  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of\\r\\nat some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a\\r\\nmonster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\r\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the\\r\\nwhale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing\\r\\nthe Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he\\r\\nattains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,\\r\\nbut is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to\\r\\nolive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the\\r\\nintertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand\\r\\ndistinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is\\r\\noften a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet\\r\\nlong, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an\\r\\nangular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the\\r\\nslightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin\\r\\nwill, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When\\r\\nthe sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical\\r\\nripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon\\r\\nthe wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle\\r\\nsurrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\\r\\nhour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\\r\\nback.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as\\r\\nsome men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;\\r\\nunexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen\\r\\nwaters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\\r\\nmisanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous\\r\\npower and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from\\r\\nman; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his\\r\\nrace, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the\\r\\nbaleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the\\r\\nright whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,\\r\\nthat is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,\\r\\nthere would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are\\r\\nlittle known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed\\r\\nwhales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are\\r\\nthe fishermen\\'s names for a few sorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn connection with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of\\r\\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\\r\\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it\\r\\nis in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,\\r\\nfounded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;\\r\\nnotwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously\\r\\nseem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\\r\\nCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\\r\\nwhale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,\\r\\nback-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\\r\\nindiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any\\r\\nregard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and\\r\\nmore essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\\r\\nwhale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this\\r\\nsame humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has\\r\\nbaleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the\\r\\nsame with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of\\r\\nwhales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any\\r\\none of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy\\r\\nall general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock\\r\\nevery one of the whale-naturalists has split.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\\r\\nwhale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\\r\\nright classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\\r\\nGreenland whale\\'s anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have\\r\\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\\r\\nGreenland whale.  And if you descend into the bowels of the various\\r\\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\\r\\nas available to the systematizer as those external ones already\\r\\nenumerated.  What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the\\r\\nwhales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them\\r\\nthat way.  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and\\r\\nit is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is\\r\\npracticable.  To proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on\\r\\nthe northern American coast.  He has been frequently captured there,\\r\\nand towed into harbor.  He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\\r\\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.  At any rate, the\\r\\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\\r\\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.  His oil is not\\r\\nvery valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the most gamesome and\\r\\nlight-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water\\r\\ngenerally than any other of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is\\r\\nknown but his name.  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.  Of\\r\\na retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.  Though\\r\\nno coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\\r\\nrises in a long sharp ridge.  Let him go.  I know little more of him,\\r\\nnor does anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring\\r\\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along\\r\\nthe Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.  He is seldom\\r\\nseen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern\\r\\nseas, and then always at too great a distance to study his\\r\\ncountenance.  He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks\\r\\nof line.  Prodigies are told of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can\\r\\nsay nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).\\r\\n\\r\\nOCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among\\r\\nwhich present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;\\r\\nIII., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\\r\\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those\\r\\nof the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to\\r\\nthem in figure, yet the bookbinder\\'s Quarto volume in its dimensioned\\r\\nform does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo\\r\\nvolume does.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose\\r\\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb\\r\\nto landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\\r\\npopularly classed among whales.  But possessing all the grand\\r\\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have\\r\\nrecognised him for one.  He is of moderate octavo size, varying from\\r\\nfifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding\\r\\ndimensions round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly\\r\\nhunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good\\r\\nfor light.  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory\\r\\nof the advance of the great sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular\\r\\nfishermen\\'s names for all these fish, for generally they are the\\r\\nbest.  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall\\r\\nsay so, and suggest another.  I do so now, touching the Black Fish,\\r\\nso-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.\\r\\nSo, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is well\\r\\nknown, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips\\r\\nare curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on\\r\\nhis face.  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in\\r\\nlength.  He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way\\r\\nof showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something\\r\\nlike a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed, the sperm\\r\\nwhale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the\\r\\nsupply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal\\r\\nhousekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by\\r\\nthemselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.  Though\\r\\ntheir blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\\r\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL\\r\\nWHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I\\r\\nsuppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked\\r\\nnose.  The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn\\r\\naverages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to\\r\\nfifteen feet.  Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,\\r\\ngrowing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the\\r\\nhorizontal.  But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an\\r\\nill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a\\r\\nclumsy left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or\\r\\nlance answers, it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used\\r\\nlike the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors\\r\\ntell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the\\r\\nbottom of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an\\r\\nice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar\\r\\nSea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so\\r\\nbreaks through.  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be\\r\\ncorrect.  My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may\\r\\nreally be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would\\r\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading\\r\\npamphlets.  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the\\r\\nHorned whale, and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious\\r\\nexample of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of\\r\\nanimated nature.  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered\\r\\nthat this same sea-unicorn\\'s horn was in ancient days regarded as the\\r\\ngreat antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it\\r\\nbrought immense prices.  It was also distilled to a volatile salts\\r\\nfor fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are\\r\\nmanufactured into hartshorn.  Originally it was in itself accounted\\r\\nan object of great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin\\r\\nFrobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did\\r\\ngallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich\\r\\nPalace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; \"when Sir Martin\\r\\nreturned from that voyage,\" saith Black Letter, \"on bended knees he\\r\\npresented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,\\r\\nwhich for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.\"  An\\r\\nIrish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did\\r\\nlikewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land\\r\\nbeast of the unicorn nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\\r\\nmilk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.\\r\\nHis oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,\\r\\nand he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is\\r\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the\\r\\nprofessed naturalist.  From what I have seen of him at a distance,\\r\\nI should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.  He is very\\r\\nsavage--a sort of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the great Folio\\r\\nwhales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty\\r\\nbrute is worried to death.  The Killer is never hunted.  I never\\r\\nheard what sort of oil he has.  Exception might be taken to the name\\r\\nbestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.  For\\r\\nwe are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks\\r\\nincluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous\\r\\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He\\r\\nmounts the Folio whale\\'s back, and as he swims, he works his passage\\r\\nby flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a\\r\\nsimilar process.  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the\\r\\nKiller.  Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).\\r\\n\\r\\nDUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.  I. The Huzza\\r\\nPorpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-mouthed\\r\\nPorpoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\\r\\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or\\r\\nfive feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the\\r\\npopular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the creatures\\r\\nset down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of\\r\\nmy definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a\\r\\nhorizontal tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the\\r\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe.  The name is of my\\r\\nown bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and\\r\\nsomething must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus, because\\r\\nhe always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep\\r\\ntossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.\\r\\nTheir appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.\\r\\nFull of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to\\r\\nwindward.  They are the lads that always live before the wind.  They\\r\\nare accounted a lucky omen.  If you yourself can withstand three\\r\\ncheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the\\r\\nspirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.  A well-fed, plump Huzza\\r\\nPorpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.  But the fine\\r\\nand delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.\\r\\nIt is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.  Sailors put it on\\r\\ntheir hones.  Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.  It may never\\r\\nhave occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so\\r\\nsmall that it is not very readily discernible.  But the next time you\\r\\nhave a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale\\r\\nhimself in miniature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.\\r\\nVery savage.  He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is\\r\\nsomewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general\\r\\nmake.  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.  I have lowered\\r\\nfor him many times, but never yet saw him captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The\\r\\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\\r\\nis known.  The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\\r\\ndesignated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\\r\\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.\\r\\nIn shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of\\r\\na less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\\r\\ngentleman-like figure.  He has no fins on his back (most other\\r\\nporpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of\\r\\na hazel hue.  But his mealy-mouth spoils all.  Though his entire\\r\\nback down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,\\r\\ndistinct as the mark in a ship\\'s hull, called the \"bright waist,\"\\r\\nthat line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours,\\r\\nblack above and white below.  The white comprises part of his head,\\r\\nand the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just\\r\\nescaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A most mean and mealy\\r\\naspect!  His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\\r\\nPorpoise is the smallest of the whales.  Above, you have all the\\r\\nLeviathans of note.  But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\\r\\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\\r\\nreputation, but not personally.  I shall enumerate them by their\\r\\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\\r\\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.\\r\\nIf any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,\\r\\nthen he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to\\r\\nhis Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale;\\r\\nthe Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading\\r\\nWhale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the\\r\\nElephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.\\r\\nFrom Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might\\r\\nbe quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of\\r\\nuncouth names.  But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can\\r\\nhardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,\\r\\nbut signifying nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\\r\\nhere, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I have\\r\\nkept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\\r\\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\\r\\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.  For\\r\\nsmall erections may be finished by their first architects; grand\\r\\nones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.  God keep me\\r\\nfrom ever completing anything.  This whole book is but a\\r\\ndraught--nay, but the draught of a draught.  Oh, Time, Strength,\\r\\nCash, and Patience!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 33\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Specksynder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\\r\\nplace as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\\r\\narising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\\r\\nclass unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\\'s vocation is evinced\\r\\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\\r\\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\\r\\nthe person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\\r\\nofficer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\\r\\nFat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\\r\\nHarpooneer.  In those days, the captain\\'s authority was restricted to\\r\\nthe navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\\r\\nwhale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\\r\\nChief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\\r\\nunder the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\\r\\nstill retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\\r\\nhe ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\\r\\ncaptain\\'s more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\\r\\nconduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\\r\\ndepends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\\r\\nimportant officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\\r\\nwatches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship\\'s deck is also\\r\\nhis; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\\r\\nshould nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\\r\\nsome way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\\r\\nby them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\\r\\nthis--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\\r\\nand merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\\r\\ncaptain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\\r\\nare lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\\r\\ntheir meals in the captain\\'s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly\\r\\ncommunicating with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the\\r\\nlongest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils\\r\\nof it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all\\r\\nof whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,\\r\\nbut upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance,\\r\\nintrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases\\r\\ntend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen\\r\\ngenerally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family\\r\\nthese whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for\\r\\nall that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck\\r\\nare seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,\\r\\nmany are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\\r\\nparading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in\\r\\nany military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if\\r\\nhe wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\\r\\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only\\r\\nhomage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though\\r\\nhe required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping\\r\\nupon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to\\r\\npeculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be\\r\\ndetailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of\\r\\ncondescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was\\r\\nby no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\\r\\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\\r\\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\\r\\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism\\r\\nof his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained\\r\\nunmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\\r\\nincarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man\\'s\\r\\nintellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the\\r\\npractical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of\\r\\nsome sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,\\r\\nmore or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God\\'s\\r\\ntrue princes of the Empire from the world\\'s hustings; and leaves the\\r\\nhighest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous\\r\\nmore through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful\\r\\nof the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over\\r\\nthe dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small\\r\\nthings when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some\\r\\nroyal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.\\r\\nBut when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of\\r\\ngeographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian\\r\\nherds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will\\r\\nthe tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its\\r\\nfullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so\\r\\nimportant in his art, as the one now alluded to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\\r\\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\\r\\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\\r\\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical\\r\\ntrappings and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand\\r\\nin thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in\\r\\nthe deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 34\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cabin-Table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\\r\\nloaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his\\r\\nlord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been\\r\\ntaking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the\\r\\nlatitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that\\r\\ndaily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete\\r\\ninattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\\r\\nheard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,\\r\\nhe swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\\r\\nsaying, \"Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\\'s step has died away, and Starbuck,\\r\\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\\r\\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the\\r\\nplanks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some\\r\\ntouch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle.\\r\\nThe second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly\\r\\nshaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with\\r\\nthat important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a\\r\\nrapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\\r\\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\\r\\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off\\r\\nhis shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\\r\\nright over the Grand Turk\\'s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,\\r\\npitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down\\r\\nrollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\\r\\nreversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\\r\\nBut ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new\\r\\nface altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask\\r\\nenters King Ahab\\'s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the\\r\\nSlave.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\r\\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\\r\\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\\r\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\\r\\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in\\r\\nthat same commander\\'s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not\\r\\nto say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head\\r\\nof the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore\\r\\nthis difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,\\r\\nKing of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\\r\\ncourteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\\r\\ngrandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit\\r\\npresides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that\\r\\nman\\'s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the\\r\\ntime; that man\\'s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar\\'s, for\\r\\nBelshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,\\r\\nhas tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social\\r\\nczarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this\\r\\nconsideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,\\r\\nthen, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of\\r\\nsea-life just mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\\r\\nsea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but\\r\\nstill deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited\\r\\nto be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in\\r\\nAhab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With\\r\\none mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man\\'s knife, as\\r\\nhe carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the\\r\\nworld they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\\r\\nobservation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And\\r\\nwhen reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\\r\\nwas locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck\\'s plate towards him, the\\r\\nmate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\\r\\nand a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\\r\\nplate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\\r\\ncircumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where\\r\\nthe German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\\r\\nElectors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\\r\\nawful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\\r\\nonly he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\\r\\nwhen a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\\r\\nFlask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\\r\\nparty.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\\r\\nbeen the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\\r\\nthis must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\\r\\ndegree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\\r\\nwould he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\\r\\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\\r\\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\\r\\nit.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\\r\\nWhether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\\r\\naccount of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\\r\\ndeemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\\r\\nwas at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\\r\\nit was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\\r\\nFlask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask\\'s dinner was\\r\\nbadly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\\r\\nof him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\\r\\nIf Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\\r\\nbut a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\\r\\nrepast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\\r\\nthree mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\\r\\nprecede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\\r\\nin private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\\r\\nofficer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\\r\\notherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\\r\\nrelieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and\\r\\nsatisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.\\r\\nI am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\\r\\nbeef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.\\r\\nThere\\'s the fruits of promotion now; there\\'s the vanity of glory:\\r\\nthere\\'s the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere\\r\\nsailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask\\'s official\\r\\ncapacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\\r\\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\\r\\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\\r\\nawful Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\\r\\ntable in the Pequod\\'s cabin.  After their departure, taking place in\\r\\ninverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\\r\\nrather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And\\r\\nthen the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\\r\\nresiduary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants\\' hall of\\r\\nthe high and mighty cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\\r\\ninvisible domineerings of the captain\\'s table, was the entire\\r\\ncare-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\\r\\ninferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,\\r\\nseemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\\r\\nharpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\\r\\nreport to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\\r\\nIndian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites\\r\\nhad Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the\\r\\nprevious repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\\r\\ngreat baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\\r\\nAnd if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\\r\\nhop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\\r\\naccelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\\r\\nonce Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy\\'s memory\\r\\nby snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\\r\\nwooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\\r\\ncircle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\\r\\nshuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\\r\\nprogeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\\r\\nstanding spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\\r\\ntumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy\\'s whole life\\r\\nwas one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\\r\\nfurnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\\r\\nclutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\\r\\nthem through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\\r\\nhis filed teeth to the Indian\\'s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\\r\\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\\r\\nthe low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\\r\\nlow cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\\r\\npassenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\\r\\nwonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\\r\\nthat by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\\r\\nvitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\\r\\nBut, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\\r\\nabounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\\r\\nthe sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\\r\\nmade or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\\r\\nthe lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\\r\\ntrembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\\r\\nlurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\\r\\nout for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\\r\\nsimple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\\r\\nhim in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\\r\\nwhetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\\r\\nlances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\\r\\nwould ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\\r\\nat all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\\r\\nin his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\\r\\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\\r\\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\\r\\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\\r\\nhis great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\\r\\nto his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\\r\\njingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\\r\\nthere; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\\r\\nscarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\\r\\nsleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar\\r\\nquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\\r\\ncaptains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\\r\\nthe ship\\'s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone\\r\\nthat anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real\\r\\ntruth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be\\r\\nsaid to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did\\r\\nenter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning\\r\\ninwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\\r\\npermanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\\r\\nhereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was\\r\\ninaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of\\r\\nChristendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as\\r\\nthe last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when\\r\\nSpring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\\r\\nhimself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking\\r\\nhis own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab\\'s soul,\\r\\nshut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen\\r\\npaws of its gloom!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 35\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mast-Head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\\r\\nthe other seamen my first mast-head came round.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\\r\\nsimultaneously with the vessel\\'s leaving her port; even though she\\r\\nmay have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\\r\\nproper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years\\'\\r\\nvoyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\\r\\nempty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\\r\\nand not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,\\r\\ndoes she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\\r\\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\\r\\nhere.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\\r\\nold Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\\r\\nthem.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\\r\\ndoubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\\r\\nmast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\\r\\nput to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\\r\\ngone by the board, in the dread gale of God\\'s wrath; therefore, we\\r\\ncannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\\r\\nthat the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\\r\\nassertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\\r\\nthe first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\\r\\nsingularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\\r\\nsides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\\r\\ntheir legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\\r\\nsing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\\r\\nout for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\\r\\nthe famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\\r\\npillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\\r\\non its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\\r\\nhim we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\\r\\nstander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\\r\\nfogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\\r\\nout to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\\r\\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\\r\\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\\r\\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\\r\\ndiscovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\\r\\nof the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\\r\\nand fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\\r\\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\\r\\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\\r\\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules\\' pillars, his column marks that\\r\\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\\r\\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\\r\\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\\r\\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\\r\\nsmoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\\r\\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\\r\\nto befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\\r\\ngaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate\\r\\nthrough the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\\r\\nrocks must be shunned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\\r\\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\\r\\nnot so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\\r\\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\\r\\nus, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\\r\\nregularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\\r\\nerected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\\r\\nascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\\r\\na hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\\r\\nwhalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\\r\\nthe ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\\r\\nbecome obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\\r\\nwhale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\\r\\nsun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\\r\\nhelm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\\r\\nweather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\\r\\nto a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\\r\\nhundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\\r\\nthe masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\\r\\nlegs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\\r\\nonce sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\\r\\nThere you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing\\r\\nruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\\r\\ntrade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most\\r\\npart, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\\r\\nyou; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\\r\\naccounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\\r\\nexcitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\\r\\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\\r\\nwhat you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years\\r\\nand more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is\\r\\nimmutable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\\'\\r\\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at\\r\\nthe mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much\\r\\nto be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\\r\\nportion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\\r\\ndestitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or\\r\\nadapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains\\r\\nto a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or\\r\\nany other of those small and snug contrivances in which men\\r\\ntemporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is\\r\\nthe head of the t\\' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin\\r\\nparallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t\\' gallant\\r\\ncross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about\\r\\nas cosy as he would standing on a bull\\'s horns.  To be sure, in cold\\r\\nweather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a\\r\\nwatch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\\r\\nof a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of\\r\\nits fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even\\r\\nmove out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\\r\\nignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\\r\\nis not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional\\r\\nskin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\\r\\nyour body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your\\r\\nwatch-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of\\r\\na southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents\\r\\nor pulpits, called CROW\\'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a\\r\\nGreenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the\\r\\nfrozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled\\r\\n\"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and\\r\\nincidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of\\r\\nOld Greenland;\" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads\\r\\nare furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then\\r\\nrecently invented CROW\\'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of\\r\\nCaptain Sleet\\'s good craft.  He called it the SLEET\\'S CROW\\'S-NEST, in\\r\\nhonour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and\\r\\nfree from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call\\r\\nour own children after our own names (we fathers being the original\\r\\ninventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after\\r\\nourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet\\'s\\r\\ncrow\\'s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open\\r\\nabove, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to\\r\\nkeep to windward of your head in a hard gale.  Being fixed on the\\r\\nsummit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in\\r\\nthe bottom.  On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,\\r\\nis a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,\\r\\ncomforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\\r\\nyour speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\\r\\nconveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in\\r\\nthis crow\\'s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with\\r\\nhim (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,\\r\\nfor the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea\\r\\nunicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at\\r\\nthem from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot\\r\\ndown upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a\\r\\nlabor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the\\r\\nlittle detailed conveniences of his crow\\'s-nest; but though he so\\r\\nenlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\\r\\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow\\'s-nest, with a\\r\\nsmall compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the\\r\\nerrors resulting from what is called the \"local attraction\" of all\\r\\nbinnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of\\r\\nthe iron in the ship\\'s planks, and in the Glacier\\'s case, perhaps, to\\r\\nthere having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I\\r\\nsay, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here,\\r\\nyet, for all his learned \"binnacle deviations,\" \"azimuth compass\\r\\nobservations,\" and \"approximate errors,\" he knows very well, Captain\\r\\nSleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\\r\\nmeditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that\\r\\nwell replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side\\r\\nof his crow\\'s nest, within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the\\r\\nwhole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and\\r\\nlearned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so\\r\\nutterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and\\r\\ncomforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded\\r\\nhead he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird\\'s nest\\r\\nwithin three or four perches of the pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\r\\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\\r\\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\r\\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.  For one, I\\r\\nused to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to\\r\\nhave a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find\\r\\nthere; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg\\r\\nover the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery\\r\\npastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\\r\\nbut sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,\\r\\nhow could I--being left completely to myself at such a\\r\\nthought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly hold my\\r\\nobligations to observe all whale-ships\\' standing orders, \"Keep your\\r\\nweather eye open, and sing out every time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\\r\\nNantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad\\r\\nwith lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;\\r\\nand who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his\\r\\nhead.  Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before\\r\\nthey can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you\\r\\nten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the\\r\\nricher.  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the\\r\\nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and\\r\\nabsent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,\\r\\nand seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not\\r\\nunfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless\\r\\ndisappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!  Ten thousand\\r\\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded\\r\\nyoung philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling\\r\\nsufficient \"interest\" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so\\r\\nhopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret\\r\\nsouls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in\\r\\nvain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is\\r\\nimperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the\\r\\nvisual nerve?  They have left their opera-glasses at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, thou monkey,\" said a harpooneer to one of these lads, \"we\\'ve\\r\\nbeen cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a\\r\\nwhale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen\\'s teeth whenever thou art up\\r\\nhere.\"  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of\\r\\nthem in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like\\r\\nlistlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded\\r\\nyouth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he\\r\\nloses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the\\r\\nvisible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind\\r\\nand nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing\\r\\nthat eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some\\r\\nundiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive\\r\\nthoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through\\r\\nit.  In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;\\r\\nbecomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer\\'s sprinkled\\r\\nPantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round\\r\\nglobe over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\\r\\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\\r\\nthe inscrutable tides of God.  But while this sleep, this dream is on\\r\\nye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\\r\\nidentity comes back in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you hover.\\r\\nAnd perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one\\r\\nhalf-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the\\r\\nsummer sea, no more to rise for ever.  Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 36\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quarter-Deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\\r\\nmorning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\\r\\ncabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at\\r\\nthat hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few\\r\\nturns in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his\\r\\nold rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all\\r\\nover dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\\r\\nwalk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\\r\\nthere also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints\\r\\nof his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\\r\\nhis nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of\\r\\nhis thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at\\r\\nthe main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that\\r\\nthought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so\\r\\ncompletely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\\r\\nmould of every outer movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"D\\'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered Stubb; \"the chick that\\'s in him\\r\\npecks the shell.  \\'Twill soon be out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing\\r\\nthe deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the\\r\\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\\r\\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\\r\\neverybody aft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\\r\\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Send everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab.  \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the entire ship\\'s company were assembled, and with curious and\\r\\nnot wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not\\r\\nunlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after\\r\\nrapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among\\r\\nthe crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\\r\\nnigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\\r\\nhalf-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\\r\\nwhispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\\r\\nthat Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\\r\\na pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,\\r\\nhe cried:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sing out for him!\" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of\\r\\nclubbed voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\\r\\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so\\r\\nmagnetically thrown them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what do ye next, men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lower away, and after him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A dead whale or a stove boat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\\r\\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\\r\\nto gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that\\r\\nthey themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\\r\\nhis pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\\r\\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\\r\\nwhite whale.  Look ye! d\\'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"--holding\\r\\nup a broad bright coin to the sun--\"it is a sixteen dollar piece,\\r\\nmen.  D\\'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\\r\\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\\r\\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\\r\\nlowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\\r\\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\\r\\nhis vitality in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\\r\\nmain-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\\r\\nwith the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\\r\\nof ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a\\r\\ncrooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with\\r\\nthree holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of\\r\\nye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my\\r\\nboys!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\\r\\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\\r\\ntopmaul: \"a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\\r\\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\\r\\nmore intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention\\r\\nof the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\\r\\nseparately touched by some specific recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same\\r\\nthat some call Moby Dick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Moby Dick?\" shouted Ahab.  \"Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\" said\\r\\nthe Gay-Header deliberately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And has he a curious spout, too,\" said Daggoo, \"very bushy, even for\\r\\na parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\\r\\nCaptain,\" cried Queequeg disjointedly, \"all twiske-tee be-twisk, like\\r\\nhim--him--\" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round\\r\\nand round as though uncorking a bottle--\"like him--him--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\\r\\nand wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a\\r\\nwhole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\\r\\nthe great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like\\r\\na split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye\\r\\nhave seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab,\" said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus\\r\\nfar been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\\r\\nseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick\\r\\nthat took off thy leg?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye,\\r\\nmy hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick\\r\\nthat brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye,\" he\\r\\nshouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\\r\\nheart-stricken moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale\\r\\nthat razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\\r\\nThen tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted\\r\\nout: \"Aye, aye! and I\\'ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the\\r\\nHorn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\\'s flames\\r\\nbefore I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to\\r\\nchase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of\\r\\nearth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,\\r\\nmen, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\\r\\nexcited old man: \"A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\\r\\nMoby Dick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.  \"God bless ye,\\r\\nmen.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what\\'s this\\r\\nlong face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?\\r\\nart not game for Moby Dick?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we\\r\\nfollow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander\\'s vengeance.\\r\\nHow many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest\\r\\nit, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket\\r\\nmarket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest\\r\\na little lower layer.  If money\\'s to be the measurer, man, and the\\r\\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\\r\\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\\r\\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He smites his chest,\" whispered Stubb, \"what\\'s that for? methinks it\\r\\nrings most vast, but hollow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vengeance on a dumb brute!\" cried Starbuck, \"that simply smote thee\\r\\nfrom blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects,\\r\\nman, are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living\\r\\nact, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning\\r\\nthing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the\\r\\nunreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How\\r\\ncan the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?\\r\\nTo me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I\\r\\nthink there\\'s naught beyond.  But \\'tis enough.  He tasks me; he heaps\\r\\nme; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice\\r\\nsinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be\\r\\nthe white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak\\r\\nthat hate upon him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I\\'d strike the\\r\\nsun if it insulted me.  For could the sun do that, then could I do\\r\\nthe other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy\\r\\npresiding over all creations.  But not my master, man, is even that\\r\\nfair play.  Who\\'s over me?  Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine\\r\\neye! more intolerable than fiends\\' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,\\r\\nso; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.\\r\\nBut look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays\\r\\nitself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I\\r\\nmeant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish\\r\\ncheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the\\r\\nsun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things,\\r\\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they\\r\\nfeel!  The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab,\\r\\nin this matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder\\r\\nChilian! he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general\\r\\nhurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?\\r\\nReckon it.  \\'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for\\r\\nStarbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt, then, the best\\r\\nlance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every\\r\\nforemast-hand has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize\\r\\nthee; I see! the billow lifts thee!  Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy\\r\\nsilence, then, THAT voices thee.  (ASIDE) Something shot from my\\r\\ndilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is\\r\\nmine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God keep me!--keep us all!\" murmured Starbuck, lowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\\r\\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from\\r\\nthe hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the\\r\\ncordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as\\r\\nfor a moment their hearts sank in.  For again Starbuck\\'s downcast\\r\\neyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh\\r\\ndied away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved\\r\\nand rolled as before.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye\\r\\nnot when ye come?  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye\\r\\nshadows!  Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications\\r\\nof the foregoing things within.  For with little external to\\r\\nconstrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still\\r\\ndrive us on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The measure! the measure!\" cried Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\\r\\nordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them before him\\r\\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\\r\\nmates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship\\'s\\r\\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\\r\\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew.  But those wild eyes met\\r\\nhis, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of\\r\\ntheir leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the\\r\\nbison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drink and pass!\" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\\r\\nnearest seaman.  \"The crew alone now drink.  Round with it, round!\\r\\nShort draughts--long swallows, men; \\'tis hot as Satan\\'s hoof.  So,\\r\\nso; it goes round excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\\r\\nserpent-snapping eye.  Well done; almost drained.  That way it went,\\r\\nthis way it comes.  Hand it me--here\\'s a hollow!  Men, ye seem the\\r\\nyears; so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;\\r\\nand ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand\\r\\nthere with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may\\r\\nin some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before\\r\\nme.  O men, you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies\\r\\ncome not sooner.  Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming\\r\\nagain, were\\'t not thou St. Vitus\\' imp--away, thou ague!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!\\r\\nLet me touch the axis.\"  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the\\r\\nthree level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so\\r\\ndoing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing\\r\\nintently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.  It seemed as\\r\\nthough, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have\\r\\nshocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the\\r\\nLeyden jar of his own magnetic life.  The three mates quailed before\\r\\nhis strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.  Stubb and Flask looked\\r\\nsideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain!\" cried Ahab; \"but, maybe, \\'tis well.  For did ye three but\\r\\nonce take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT\\r\\nhad perhaps expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have\\r\\ndropped ye dead.  Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now,\\r\\nye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen\\r\\nthere--yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant\\r\\nharpooneers.  Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the\\r\\nfeet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals!\\r\\nyour own condescension, THAT shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye;\\r\\nye will it.  Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\\r\\ndetached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,\\r\\nbarbs up, before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them over! know\\r\\nye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye\\r\\ncup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!\"\\r\\nForthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed\\r\\nthe harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!\\r\\nBestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.\\r\\nHa!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to\\r\\nsit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man\\r\\nthe deathful whaleboat\\'s bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all,\\r\\nif we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!\"  The long, barbed steel\\r\\ngoblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white\\r\\nwhale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.\\r\\nStarbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,\\r\\nthe replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,\\r\\nwaving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired\\r\\nwithin his cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 37\\r\\n\\r\\nSunset.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where\\'er\\r\\nI sail.  The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let\\r\\nthem; but first I pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nYonder, by ever-brimming goblet\\'s rim, the warm waves blush like\\r\\nwine.  The gold brow plumbs the blue.  The diver sun--slow dived from\\r\\nnoon--goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless\\r\\nhill.  Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of\\r\\nLombardy.  Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not\\r\\nits far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly\\r\\nconfounds.  \\'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  \\'Tis split, too--that\\r\\nI feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against\\r\\nthe solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no\\r\\nhelmet in the most brain-battering fight!\\r\\n\\r\\nDry heat upon my brow?  Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly\\r\\nspurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No more.  This lovely light, it\\r\\nlights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne\\'er\\r\\nenjoy.  Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying\\r\\npower; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst\\r\\nof Paradise!  Good night--good night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM\\r\\nTHE WINDOW.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Twas not so hard a task.  I thought to find one stubborn, at the\\r\\nleast; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels,\\r\\nand they revolve.  Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder,\\r\\nthey all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to fire\\r\\nothers, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I\\'ve dared,\\r\\nI\\'ve willed; and what I\\'ve willed, I\\'ll do!  They think me\\r\\nmad--Starbuck does; but I\\'m demoniac, I am madness maddened!  That\\r\\nwild madness that\\'s only calm to comprehend itself!  The prophecy was\\r\\nthat I should be dismembered; and--Aye!  I lost this leg.  I now\\r\\nprophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.  Now, then, be the\\r\\nprophet and the fulfiller one.  That\\'s more than ye, ye great gods,\\r\\never were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,\\r\\nye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not say as schoolboys\\r\\ndo to bullies--Take some one of your own size; don\\'t pommel ME!  No,\\r\\nye\\'ve knocked me down, and I am up again; but YE have run and hidden.\\r\\nCome forth from behind your cotton bags!  I have no long gun to\\r\\nreach ye.  Come, Ahab\\'s compliments to ye; come and see if ye can\\r\\nswerve me.  Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve\\r\\nyourselves! man has ye there.  Swerve me?  The path to my fixed\\r\\npurpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.\\r\\nOver unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under\\r\\ntorrents\\' beds, unerringly I rush!  Naught\\'s an obstacle, naught\\'s an\\r\\nangle to the iron way!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 38\\r\\n\\r\\nDusk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy soul is more than matched; she\\'s overmanned; and by a madman!\\r\\nInsufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field!\\r\\nBut he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me!  I\\r\\nthink I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.\\r\\nWill I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with\\r\\na cable I have no knife to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who\\'s over him,\\r\\nhe cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he\\r\\nlords it over all below!  Oh!  I plainly see my miserable office,--to\\r\\nobey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!  For in\\r\\nhis eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.  Yet is\\r\\nthere hope.  Time and tide flow wide.  The hated whale has the round\\r\\nwatery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.\\r\\nHis heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside.  I would up\\r\\nheart, were it not like lead.  But my whole clock\\'s run down; my\\r\\nheart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of\\r\\nhuman mothers in them!  Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea.  The\\r\\nwhite whale is their demigorgon.  Hark! the infernal orgies! that\\r\\nrevelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft!  Methinks it\\r\\npictures life.  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay,\\r\\nembattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where\\r\\nhe broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of\\r\\nthe wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.  The long\\r\\nhowl thrills me through!  Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch!\\r\\nOh, life!  \\'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to\\r\\nknowledge,--as wild, untutored things are forced to feed--Oh, life!\\r\\n\\'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but \\'tis not me!\\r\\nthat horror\\'s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in\\r\\nme, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures!

Why so?\\r\\nBecause a laugh\\'s the wisest, easiest answer to all that\\'s queer; and\\r\\ncome what will, one comfort\\'s always left--that unfailing comfort is,\\r\\nit\\'s all predestinated.  I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but\\r\\nto my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening\\r\\nfelt.  Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew\\r\\nit; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I\\r\\nclapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, WISE\\r\\nStubb--that\\'s my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here\\'s a\\r\\ncarcase.  I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,\\r\\nI\\'ll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your\\r\\nhorribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!  What\\'s my juicy\\r\\nlittle pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--Giving a party\\r\\nto the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate\\'s\\r\\npennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!

With greedy ears I learned the history\\r\\nof that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken\\r\\nour oaths of violence and revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\\r\\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\r\\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them knew of\\r\\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\\r\\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\\r\\nbattle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of\\r\\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the\\r\\nentire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their\\r\\nquest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole\\r\\ntwelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling\\r\\nsail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the\\r\\nirregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other\\r\\ncircumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread\\r\\nthrough the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\\r\\nindividualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be\\r\\ndoubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such\\r\\nor such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of\\r\\nuncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great\\r\\nmischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some\\r\\nminds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in\\r\\nquestion must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the\\r\\nSperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent\\r\\ninstances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster\\r\\nattacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly\\r\\ngave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,\\r\\nwere content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it\\r\\nwere, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the\\r\\nindividual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter\\r\\nbetween Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by\\r\\nchance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had\\r\\nevery one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,\\r\\nas for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such\\r\\ncalamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained\\r\\nwrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal\\r\\nto the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,\\r\\nall accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those\\r\\nthings had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to\\r\\nwhom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the\\r\\nmore horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not\\r\\nonly do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all\\r\\nsurprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its\\r\\nfungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,\\r\\nwild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them\\r\\nto cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so\\r\\nthe whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the\\r\\nwonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate\\r\\nthere.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that\\r\\nignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all\\r\\nsailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact\\r\\nwith whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face\\r\\nthey not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle\\r\\nto them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a\\r\\nthousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to\\r\\nany chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of\\r\\nthe sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a\\r\\ncalling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending\\r\\nto make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit\\r\\nover the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale\\r\\ndid in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid\\r\\nhints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,\\r\\nwhich eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from\\r\\nanything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic\\r\\ndid he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had\\r\\nheard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to\\r\\nencounter the perils of his jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at\\r\\nwork.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the\\r\\nSperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\r\\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There\\r\\nare those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\\r\\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\\r\\nperhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\\r\\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\\r\\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\\r\\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\\r\\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\\r\\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\\r\\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\\r\\nwhaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm\\r\\nWhale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those\\r\\nprows which stem him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\\r\\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\\r\\nnaturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\\r\\nto be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\\r\\nbe so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\\r\\nblood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier\\'s, were these or\\r\\nalmost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the\\r\\nBaron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\\r\\n(sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively terrors,\" and\\r\\n\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against\\r\\nthe rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\"  And\\r\\nhowever the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports\\r\\nas these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty\\r\\nitem of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some\\r\\nvicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\\r\\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier\\r\\ndays of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\\r\\ninduce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\\r\\nnew and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\\r\\nleviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\\r\\nat such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\\r\\nThat to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\\r\\neternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\\r\\nbe consulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\\r\\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\\r\\nwho, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\\r\\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\\r\\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\\r\\nif offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\\r\\nlinked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\\r\\ninclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\\r\\nthat he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\\r\\nand the same instant of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\\r\\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For\\r\\nas the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been\\r\\ndivulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\\r\\nunaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\\r\\nthe most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\\r\\nespecially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\\r\\ngreat depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\\r\\nmost widely distant points.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\\r\\nand as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\\r\\nScoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\\r\\nPacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\\r\\nin the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\\r\\nthese instances it has been declared that the interval of time\\r\\nbetween the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\\r\\nHence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\\r\\nNor\\' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\\r\\nthe whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\\r\\nmen, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\\r\\nmountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\\r\\nwhich the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\\r\\nmore wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\\r\\nwaters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\\r\\nunderground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\\r\\nequalled by the realities of the whalemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\\r\\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\\r\\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\\r\\nwhalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\\r\\nMoby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\\r\\nubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\\r\\nhis flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\\r\\never be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\\r\\nghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of\\r\\nleagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\\r\\nin the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\\r\\nstrike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much\\r\\nhis uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\\r\\nwhales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\\r\\nwrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\\r\\nhis prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\\r\\nuncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\\r\\nthose who knew him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\\r\\nthe same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\\r\\ndistinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\\r\\njustified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\\r\\na dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\\r\\nspangled with golden gleamings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\\r\\nhis deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\\r\\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\\r\\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\\r\\nassaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\\r\\ndismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\\r\\nexulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\\r\\nseveral times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\\r\\nupon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\\r\\nin consternation to their ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\\r\\nsimilar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\\r\\nunusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\\r\\nWhale\\'s infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\\r\\ndeath that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\\r\\ninflicted by an unintelligent agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\\r\\nof his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\\r\\nchewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\\r\\nof the white curds of the whale\\'s direful wrath into the serene,\\r\\nexasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\\r\\nthe eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,\\r\\nhad dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\\r\\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\\r\\nwhale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly\\r\\nsweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had\\r\\nreaped away Ahab\\'s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No\\r\\nturbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with\\r\\nmore seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that\\r\\never since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\\r\\nvindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\\r\\nfrantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all\\r\\nhis bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\\r\\nexasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\\r\\nincarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\\r\\neating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\\r\\nhalf a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the\\r\\nbeginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\\r\\none-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\\r\\nreverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\\r\\nit like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\\r\\nwhite whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that\\r\\nmost maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all\\r\\ntruth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\\r\\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to\\r\\ncrazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable\\r\\nin Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale\\'s white hump the sum of all\\r\\nthe general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and\\r\\nthen, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart\\'s\\r\\nshell upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise\\r\\nat the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at\\r\\nthe monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,\\r\\npassionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\\r\\ntore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but\\r\\nnothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\\r\\nhome, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\\r\\nstretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\\r\\ndreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and\\r\\ngashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.\\r\\nThat it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,\\r\\nthat the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the\\r\\nfact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\\r\\nand, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in\\r\\nhis Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,\\r\\nthat his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\\r\\nsailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\\r\\nmad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable\\r\\nlatitudes, the ship, with mild stun\\'sails spread, floated across the\\r\\ntranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man\\'s delirium\\r\\nseemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth\\r\\nfrom his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he\\r\\nbore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm\\r\\norders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\\r\\nnow gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human\\r\\nmadness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you\\r\\nthink it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still\\r\\nsubtler form.  Ahab\\'s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\\r\\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\\r\\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in\\r\\nhis narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\\'s broad madness had\\r\\nbeen left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\\r\\nnatural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became\\r\\nthe living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his\\r\\nspecial lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned\\r\\nall its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from\\r\\nhaving lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\\r\\nthousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear\\r\\nupon any one reasonable object.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is much; yet Ahab\\'s larger, darker, deeper part remains\\r\\nunhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is\\r\\nprofound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked\\r\\nHotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now\\r\\nquit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast\\r\\nRoman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of\\r\\nman\\'s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits\\r\\nin bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned\\r\\non torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that\\r\\ncaptive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his\\r\\nfrozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye\\r\\nprouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family\\r\\nlikeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from\\r\\nyour grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my\\r\\nmeans are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to\\r\\nkill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind\\r\\nhe did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of\\r\\nhis dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his\\r\\nwill determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that\\r\\ndissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no\\r\\nNantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and\\r\\nthat to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\r\\nascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness\\r\\nwhich always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on\\r\\nthe present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very\\r\\nunlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling\\r\\nvoyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of\\r\\nthat prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those\\r\\nvery reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a\\r\\npursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.\\r\\nGnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting\\r\\nfangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would\\r\\nseem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the\\r\\nmost appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be\\r\\ncorporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem\\r\\nsuperlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the\\r\\nattack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad\\r\\nsecret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had\\r\\npurposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and\\r\\nall-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his\\r\\nold acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in\\r\\nhim then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\\r\\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!  They were bent on\\r\\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\\r\\nmint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\\r\\nrevenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with\\r\\ncurses a Job\\'s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,\\r\\nchiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and\\r\\ncannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere\\r\\nunaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable\\r\\njollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading\\r\\nmediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially\\r\\npicked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his\\r\\nmonomaniac revenge.  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to\\r\\nthe old man\\'s ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,\\r\\nthat at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much\\r\\ntheir insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the\\r\\nWhite Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,\\r\\nalso, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding\\r\\ngreat demon of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to\\r\\ndive deeper than Ishmael can go.  The subterranean miner that works\\r\\nin us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever\\r\\nshifting, muffled sound of his pick?  Who does not feel the\\r\\nirresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand\\r\\nstill?  For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and\\r\\nthe place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see\\r\\nnaught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 42\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whiteness of The Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\\r\\nwas to me, as yet remains unsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,\\r\\nwhich could not but occasionally awaken in any man\\'s soul some alarm,\\r\\nthere was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror\\r\\nconcerning him, which at times by its intensity completely\\r\\noverpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable\\r\\nwas it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.\\r\\nIt was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.\\r\\nBut how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,\\r\\nrandom way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be\\r\\nnaught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,\\r\\nas if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\\r\\njaponicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\\r\\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the\\r\\nbarbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title \"Lord of the\\r\\nWhite Elephants\" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of\\r\\ndominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white\\r\\nquadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the\\r\\none figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,\\r\\nCaesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour\\r\\nthe same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to\\r\\nthe human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over\\r\\nevery dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been\\r\\neven made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone\\r\\nmarked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and\\r\\nsymbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,\\r\\nnoble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though\\r\\namong the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum\\r\\nwas the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness\\r\\ntypifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and\\r\\ncontributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by\\r\\nmilk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\\r\\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine\\r\\nspotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white\\r\\nforked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek\\r\\nmythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white\\r\\nbull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of\\r\\nthe sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their\\r\\ntheology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest\\r\\nenvoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of\\r\\ntheir own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for\\r\\nwhite, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their\\r\\nsacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and\\r\\nthough among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially\\r\\nemployed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the\\r\\nVision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the\\r\\nfour-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white\\r\\nthrone, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for\\r\\nall these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and\\r\\nhonourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the\\r\\ninnermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul\\r\\nthan that redness which affrights in blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,\\r\\nwhen divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any\\r\\nobject terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest\\r\\nbounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of\\r\\nthe tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\\r\\ntranscendent horrors they are?  That ghastly whiteness it is which\\r\\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than\\r\\nterrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.  So that not the\\r\\nfierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as\\r\\nthe white-shrouded bear or shark.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him\\r\\nwho would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\\r\\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\\r\\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened\\r\\nhideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that\\r\\nthe irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in\\r\\nthe fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\\r\\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear\\r\\nfrightens us with so unnatural a contrast.  But even assuming all\\r\\nthis to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not\\r\\nhave that intensified terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in\\r\\nthat creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies\\r\\nwith the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is\\r\\nmost vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that\\r\\nfish.  The Romish mass for the dead begins with \"Requiem eternam\"\\r\\n(eternal rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any\\r\\nother funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness\\r\\nof death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the\\r\\nFrench call him REQUIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\\r\\nwonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\\r\\nimaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God\\'s great,\\r\\nunflattering laureate, Nature.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during a\\r\\nprolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.  From my\\r\\nforenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,\\r\\ndashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of\\r\\nunspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.  At\\r\\nintervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace\\r\\nsome holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.  Though\\r\\nbodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king\\'s ghost in\\r\\nsupernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,\\r\\nmethought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham\\r\\nbefore the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its\\r\\nwings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the\\r\\nmiserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.  Long I gazed\\r\\nat that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell, can only hint, the things\\r\\nthat darted through me then.  But at last I awoke; and turning, asked\\r\\na sailor what bird was this.  A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had\\r\\nheard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is\\r\\nutterly unknown to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned\\r\\nthat goney was some seaman\\'s name for albatross.  So that by no\\r\\npossibility could Coleridge\\'s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\\r\\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\\r\\nour deck.  For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird\\r\\nto be an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish\\r\\na little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\\r\\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\\r\\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\\r\\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\\r\\nemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not, and I will\\r\\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the\\r\\nsea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,\\r\\nleathern tally round its neck, with the ship\\'s time and place; and\\r\\nthen letting it escape.  But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant\\r\\nfor man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join\\r\\nthe wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of\\r\\nthe White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\\r\\nlarge-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\\r\\nthousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.  He was the\\r\\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\\r\\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At\\r\\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\\r\\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of\\r\\nhis mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings\\r\\nmore resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished\\r\\nhim.  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,\\r\\nwestern world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters\\r\\nrevived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic\\r\\nas a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.  Whether\\r\\nmarching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts\\r\\nthat endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether\\r\\nwith his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon,\\r\\nthe White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils\\r\\nreddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented\\r\\nhimself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling\\r\\nreverence and awe.  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on\\r\\nlegendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual\\r\\nwhiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that\\r\\nthis divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at\\r\\nthe same time enforced a certain nameless terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\r\\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\\r\\nAlbatross.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often\\r\\nshocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and\\r\\nkin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by\\r\\nthe name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--has no\\r\\nsubstantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading\\r\\nwhiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.\\r\\nWhy should this be so?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but\\r\\nnot the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\\r\\ncrowning attribute of the terrible.  From its snowy aspect, the\\r\\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\\r\\nSquall.  Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\\r\\nomitted so potent an auxiliary.  How wildly it heightens the effect\\r\\nof that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of\\r\\ntheir faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their\\r\\nbailiff in the market-place!\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\\r\\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.  It\\r\\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\\r\\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\\r\\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\\r\\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.  And\\r\\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\\r\\nshroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions do we\\r\\nfail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts\\r\\nrising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us\\r\\nadd, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the\\r\\nevangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\\r\\nthing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\\r\\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\\r\\naccount for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.  Can we,\\r\\nthen, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing\\r\\nof whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part\\r\\nstripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught\\r\\nfearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same\\r\\nsorcery, however modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some\\r\\nchance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\\r\\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.\\r\\nAnd though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions\\r\\nabout to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few\\r\\nperhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore\\r\\nmay not be able to recall them now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\\r\\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare\\r\\nmention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,\\r\\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded\\r\\nwith new-fallen snow?  Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant\\r\\nof the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a\\r\\nWhite Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\\r\\nkings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White\\r\\nTower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an\\r\\nuntravelled American, than those other storied structures, its\\r\\nneighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer\\r\\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar\\r\\nmoods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\\r\\nmention of that name, while the thought of Virginia\\'s Blue Ridge is\\r\\nfull of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of\\r\\nall latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert\\r\\nsuch a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea\\r\\nlulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on\\r\\nthe waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?\\r\\nOr, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to\\r\\nthe fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,\\r\\ndoes \"the tall pale man\" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless\\r\\npallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves--why is\\r\\nthis phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the\\r\\nBlocksburg?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\\r\\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\\r\\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her\\r\\nwide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all\\r\\nadroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban\\r\\navenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack\\r\\nof cards;--it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the\\r\\nstrangest, saddest city thou can\\'st see.  For Lima has taken the\\r\\nwhite veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her\\r\\nwoe.  Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;\\r\\nadmits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her\\r\\nbroken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own\\r\\ndistortions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness\\r\\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\\r\\nobjects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there\\r\\naught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind\\r\\nalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when\\r\\nexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\\r\\nuniversality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\\r\\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if\\r\\nby night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels\\r\\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\\r\\nprecisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock\\r\\nto view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky\\r\\nwhiteness--as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white\\r\\nbears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious\\r\\ndread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him\\r\\nas a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off\\r\\nsoundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue\\r\\nwater is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell\\r\\nthee, \"Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as\\r\\nthe fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\\r\\nsnowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\\r\\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such\\r\\nvast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it\\r\\nwould be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same is\\r\\nit with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative\\r\\nindifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no\\r\\nshadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.  Not\\r\\nso the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at\\r\\ntimes, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost\\r\\nand air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows\\r\\nspeaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless\\r\\nchurchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and\\r\\nsplintered crosses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is\\r\\nbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a\\r\\nhypo, Ishmael.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley\\r\\nof Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon\\r\\nthe sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,\\r\\nso that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal\\r\\nmuskiness--why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the\\r\\nground in phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of\\r\\nany gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the\\r\\nstrange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated\\r\\nwith the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New\\r\\nEngland colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the\\r\\nknowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though thousands of miles\\r\\nfrom Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending,\\r\\ngoring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the\\r\\nprairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings\\r\\nof the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the\\r\\nwindrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the\\r\\nshaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\\r\\n\\r\\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the\\r\\nmystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,\\r\\nsomewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects\\r\\nthis visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were\\r\\nformed in fright.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\\r\\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange\\r\\nand far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the most\\r\\nmeaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the\\r\\nChristian\\'s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent\\r\\nin things the most appalling to mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\\r\\nand immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with\\r\\nthe thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the\\r\\nmilky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a\\r\\ncolour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the\\r\\nconcrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a\\r\\ndumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a\\r\\ncolourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink?  And when we\\r\\nconsider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all\\r\\nother earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet\\r\\ntinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of\\r\\nbutterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are\\r\\nbut subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only\\r\\nlaid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints\\r\\nlike the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the\\r\\ncharnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that\\r\\nthe mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great\\r\\nprinciple of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself,\\r\\nand if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,\\r\\neven tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this,\\r\\nthe palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful\\r\\ntravellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring\\r\\nglasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind\\r\\nat the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around\\r\\nhim.  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.\\r\\nWonder ye then at the fiery hunt?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 43\\r\\n\\r\\nHark!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing\\r\\nin a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the\\r\\nwaist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  In this manner, they\\r\\npassed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.  Standing, for the most\\r\\npart, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were\\r\\ncareful not to speak or rustle their feet.  From hand to hand, the\\r\\nbuckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional\\r\\nflap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,\\r\\nwhose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a\\r\\nCholo, the words above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d\\'ye mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There it is again--under the hatches--don\\'t you hear it--a cough--it\\r\\nsounded like a cough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers\\r\\nturning over, now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It\\'s the three soaked\\r\\nbiscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.\\r\\nLook to the bucket!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say what ye will, shipmate; I\\'ve sharp ears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, you are the chap, ain\\'t ye, that heard the hum of the old\\r\\nQuakeress\\'s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;\\r\\nyou\\'re the chap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grin away; we\\'ll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is\\r\\nsomebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;\\r\\nand I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  I heard Stubb\\r\\ntell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort\\r\\nin the wind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tish! the bucket!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 44\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall\\r\\nthat took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\\r\\npurpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\\r\\ntransom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\\r\\ncharts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then\\r\\nseating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\\r\\nvarious lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but\\r\\nsteady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\\r\\nblank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside\\r\\nhim, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on\\r\\nvarious former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been\\r\\ncaptured or seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over\\r\\nhis head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\\r\\never threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\\r\\nbrow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out\\r\\nlines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was\\r\\nalso tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\\r\\nforehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\\r\\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they\\r\\nwere brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\\r\\nand others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans\\r\\nbefore him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a\\r\\nview to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of\\r\\nhis soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\\r\\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\\r\\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it\\r\\nseem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and\\r\\nthereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale\\'s food; and,\\r\\nalso, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\\r\\nhim in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\\r\\nalmost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be\\r\\nupon this or that ground in search of his prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\\r\\nsperm whale\\'s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\\r\\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\\r\\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\\r\\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\\r\\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\\r\\nflights of swallows.  On this hint, attempts have been made to\\r\\nconstruct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\\r\\nan official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\\r\\nObservatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\\r\\nappears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\\r\\nportions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\\r\\nthe ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\\r\\nof longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\\r\\ntwelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\\r\\nof which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days\\r\\nthat have been spent in each month in every district, and the two\\r\\nothers to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,\\r\\nhave been seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\\r\\nthe sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,\\r\\nsecret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are\\r\\ncalled; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\\r\\nundeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\\r\\nchart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\\r\\ncases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\\r\\nsurveyor\\'s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\\r\\nconfined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\\r\\nVEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\\r\\nsome few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\\r\\nexpand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\\r\\nwhale-ship\\'s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\\r\\nzone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\\r\\nalong that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\\r\\nfor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\\r\\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\\r\\ncrossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\\r\\nby his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\\r\\nbe wholly without prospect of a meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\r\\ndelirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\\r\\nperhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\\r\\nseasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\\r\\nthat the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\\r\\nthis year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\\r\\nthat were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\\r\\nand unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\\r\\ntrue.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\\r\\napplies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\\r\\nwhales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\\r\\nexample, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\\r\\nor Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\\r\\nwere the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\\r\\ncorresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\\r\\ntoo, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\\r\\nhimself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\\r\\nocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\\r\\nwhere Ahab\\'s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\\r\\nspoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\\r\\nantecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\\r\\nplace were attained, when all possibilities would become\\r\\nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\\r\\nnext thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\\r\\nconjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\\r\\nthere and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\\r\\nperiodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\\r\\nsun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\\r\\nsign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\\r\\nencounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\\r\\nstoried with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\\r\\nmonomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\\r\\nin the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\\r\\nwhich Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\\r\\nwould not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\\r\\nfact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\\r\\nnor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\\r\\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\\r\\nthe Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\\r\\ncommander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\\r\\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\\r\\nPacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\\r\\nnext ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod\\'s sailing\\r\\nhad, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\\r\\nvery complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\\r\\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\\r\\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\\r\\nhunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\\r\\nremote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\\r\\nwrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\\r\\nSeas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\\r\\nPampas, Nor\\'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\\r\\nand Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\\r\\nworld-circle of the Pequod\\'s circumnavigating wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\\r\\nnot but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\\r\\nsolitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\\r\\nindividual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\\r\\nin the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\\r\\npeculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\\r\\nnot but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\\r\\nwould mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\\r\\nafter midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\\r\\nand shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\\r\\nlike a lost sheep\\'s ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\\r\\nbreathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\\r\\nover him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\\r\\nhis strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure\\r\\nwho is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps\\r\\nwith clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his\\r\\npalms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably\\r\\nvivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts\\r\\nthrough the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and\\r\\nwhirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\\r\\nthe very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\\r\\nwhen, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\\r\\nhis being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\\r\\nwhich forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\\r\\nbeckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\\r\\nyawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and\\r\\nwith glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\\r\\nescaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\\r\\nbeing the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\\r\\nat his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\\r\\nFor, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\\r\\nhunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\\r\\nwas not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\\r\\nagain.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\\r\\nand in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\\r\\nmind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\\r\\nagent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\\r\\nof the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\\r\\nintegral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\\r\\nsoul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\\'s case, yielding up\\r\\nall his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\\r\\npurpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against\\r\\ngods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its\\r\\nown.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to\\r\\nwhich it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and\\r\\nunfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of\\r\\nbodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\\r\\ntime but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of\\r\\nliving light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\\r\\ntherefore a blankness in itself.  God help thee, old man, thy\\r\\nthoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense\\r\\nthinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart\\r\\nfor ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 45\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Affidavit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,\\r\\nas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\\r\\nparticulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in\\r\\nits earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this\\r\\nvolume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\\r\\nmore familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\\r\\nand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance\\r\\nof the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural\\r\\nverity of the main points of this affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be\\r\\ncontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\\r\\nitems, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from\\r\\nthese citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally\\r\\nfollow of itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\\r\\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\\r\\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\\r\\nthe same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\\r\\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body.  In the instance where\\r\\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and\\r\\nI think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\\r\\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage\\r\\nto Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and\\r\\npenetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of\\r\\nnearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,\\r\\npoisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to\\r\\nwandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he\\r\\nhad struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice\\r\\ncircumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\\r\\nAfrica; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\\r\\ntogether, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\\r\\nknown three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw\\r\\nthe whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons\\r\\nwith the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead\\r\\nfish.  In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the\\r\\nboat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly\\r\\nrecognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale\\'s eye, which\\r\\nI had observed there three years previous.  I say three years, but I\\r\\nam pretty sure it was more than that.  Here are three instances,\\r\\nthen, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many\\r\\nother instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no\\r\\ngood ground to impeach.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however\\r\\nignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several\\r\\nmemorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean\\r\\nhas been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such\\r\\na whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to\\r\\nhis bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for\\r\\nhowever peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon\\r\\nput an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down\\r\\ninto a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from\\r\\nthe fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige\\r\\nof perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo\\r\\nRinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him\\r\\nby merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered\\r\\nlounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more\\r\\nintimate acquaintance.  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to\\r\\nknow an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\\r\\nsalutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the\\r\\nacquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their\\r\\npresumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\r\\ncelebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\\r\\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\\r\\nbut he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions\\r\\nof a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it\\r\\nnot so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,\\r\\nwho so long did\\'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose\\r\\nspout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it not so, O\\r\\nNew Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their\\r\\nwakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!\\r\\nKing of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the\\r\\nsemblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?  Was it not so, O\\r\\nDon Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with\\r\\nmystic hieroglyphics upon the back!  In plain prose, here are four\\r\\nwhales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or\\r\\nSylla to the classic scholar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at\\r\\nvarious times creating great havoc among the boats of different\\r\\nvessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,\\r\\nchased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their\\r\\nanchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out\\r\\nthrough the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his\\r\\nmind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost\\r\\nwarrior of the Indian King Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\\r\\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\\r\\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\\r\\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.  For\\r\\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires\\r\\nfull as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of\\r\\nsome of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that\\r\\nwithout some hints touching the plain facts, historical and\\r\\notherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a\\r\\nmonstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and\\r\\nintolerable allegory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\\r\\nperils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed,\\r\\nvivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they\\r\\nrecur.  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual\\r\\ndisasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a\\r\\npublic record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten\\r\\nthat record.  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this\\r\\nmoment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea,\\r\\nis being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding\\r\\nleviathan--do you suppose that that poor fellow\\'s name will appear in\\r\\nthe newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?\\r\\nNo: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.\\r\\nIn fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct\\r\\nor indirect from New Guinea?  Yet I tell you that upon one particular\\r\\nvoyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty\\r\\ndifferent ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some\\r\\nof them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat\\'s crew.\\r\\nFor God\\'s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a\\r\\ngallon you burn, but at least one drop of man\\'s blood was spilled for\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\\r\\nis an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that\\r\\nwhen narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold\\r\\nenormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\\r\\nfacetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\\r\\nbeing facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues\\r\\nof Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\\r\\ntestimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this: The\\r\\nSperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and\\r\\njudiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,\\r\\nutterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm\\r\\nWhale HAS done it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of\\r\\nNantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw\\r\\nspouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.\\r\\nEre long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very\\r\\nlarge whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore\\r\\ndirectly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,\\r\\nhe so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down\\r\\nand fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\\r\\nAfter the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\\r\\ntheir boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more\\r\\nsailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\\r\\nshipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second\\r\\ntime his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he\\r\\nhas never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a\\r\\nresident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of\\r\\nthe Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and\\r\\nfaithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this\\r\\nwithin a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The following are extracts from Chace\\'s narrative: \"Every fact\\r\\nseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance\\r\\nwhich directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the\\r\\nship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to\\r\\ntheir direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\\r\\nmade ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for\\r\\nthe shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\\r\\nnecessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\\r\\nresentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had\\r\\njust before entered, and in which we had struck three of his\\r\\ncompanions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.\"  Again:\\r\\n\"At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening\\r\\nbefore my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my\\r\\nmind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many\\r\\nof which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied\\r\\nthat I am correct in my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\\r\\nblack night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\\r\\nhospitable shore.  \"The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;\\r\\nthe fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed\\r\\nupon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\\r\\ncontemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment\\'s thought; the\\r\\ndismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,\\r\\nwholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its\\r\\nappearance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another place--p. 45,--he speaks of \"THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL\\r\\nATTACK OF THE ANIMAL.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\\r\\ntotally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\\r\\nparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\\r\\nthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\\r\\nallusions to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then\\r\\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to\\r\\nbe dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship\\r\\nin the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon\\r\\nwhales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the\\r\\namazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen\\r\\npresent.  He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so\\r\\nsmite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a\\r\\nthimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.  Some weeks after,\\r\\nthe Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But\\r\\nhe was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few\\r\\nmoments\\' confidential business with him.  That business consisted in\\r\\nfetching the Commodore\\'s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps\\r\\ngoing he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.\\r\\nI am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore\\'s interview\\r\\nwith that whale as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted\\r\\nfrom unbelief by a similar fright?  I tell you, the sperm whale will\\r\\nstand no nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff\\'s Voyages for a little\\r\\ncircumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.\\r\\nLangsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian\\r\\nAdmiral Krusenstern\\'s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of\\r\\nthe present century.  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth\\r\\nchapter:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\\r\\nday we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\\r\\nwas very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\\r\\nto keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\\r\\nit was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\\r\\nsprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\\r\\nthan the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\\r\\nnot perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\\r\\nwhich was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\\r\\nimpossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\\r\\nin the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\\r\\nits back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\\r\\nmasts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\\r\\nall sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\\r\\nupon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\\r\\nthe utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D\\'Wolf applied immediately\\r\\nto the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\\r\\ndamage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\\r\\nentirely uninjured.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Captain D\\'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\\r\\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\\r\\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\\r\\nDorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\\r\\nI have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\\r\\nLangsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\\r\\nno means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\\r\\nand purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\\r\\nsailed from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\\r\\ntoo, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\\r\\nDampier\\'s old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that\\r\\njust quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here\\r\\nfor a corroborative example, if such be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\\r\\nthe modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\\r\\nfour o\\'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\\r\\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\\r\\nwhich put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\\r\\nwhere they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\\r\\ndeath.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\\r\\ntook it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\\r\\namazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\\r\\nno ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\\r\\ntheir carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\\r\\nhammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\\r\\nout of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\\r\\nearthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\\r\\na great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\\r\\nmischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\\r\\nthe darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\\r\\nall caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\\r\\nbeneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\\r\\nto me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\\r\\nmore than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\\r\\nassailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\\r\\nand long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\\r\\nEnglish ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\\r\\nhis strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\\r\\nlines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\\r\\ntransferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\\r\\ngreat hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\\r\\nAgain, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\\r\\nstruck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\\r\\nblind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\\r\\npursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\\r\\ncharacter, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\\r\\nmouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\\r\\nminutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\\r\\nillustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you\\r\\nwill not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\\r\\nthis book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\\r\\nthese marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\\r\\nthat for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is\\r\\nnothing new under the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\\r\\nmagistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\\r\\nand Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\\r\\nown times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\\r\\nauthorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\\r\\nunexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\\r\\nat all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\\r\\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\\r\\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\\r\\ndestroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\\r\\nthan fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\\r\\neasily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\\r\\nprecise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\\r\\ndestroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\\r\\nwhale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will\\r\\ntell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\\r\\nbeen always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\\r\\nconnecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\\r\\nand perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\\r\\nplace for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations\\r\\nhave recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\\r\\nisolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\\r\\nMediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\\r\\ncoast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\\r\\nsperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\\r\\nDardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\\r\\nof the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\\r\\nsubstance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\\r\\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\\r\\nwhale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\\r\\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\\r\\nfound at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\\r\\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\\r\\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius\\'s sea-monster, that for\\r\\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\\r\\nprobability have been a sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 46\\r\\n\\r\\nSurmises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\r\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\\r\\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to\\r\\nthat one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature\\r\\nand long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman\\'s ways,\\r\\naltogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or\\r\\nat least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives\\r\\nmuch more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,\\r\\nperhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his\\r\\nvindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended\\r\\nitself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters\\r\\nhe slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each\\r\\nsubsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he\\r\\nhunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there\\r\\nwere still additional considerations which, though not so strictly\\r\\naccording with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no\\r\\nmeans incapable of swaying him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used\\r\\nin the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He\\r\\nknew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some\\r\\nrespects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the\\r\\ncomplete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority\\r\\ninvolves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the\\r\\nintellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck\\'s\\r\\nbody and Starbuck\\'s coerced will were Ahab\\'s, so long as Ahab kept\\r\\nhis magnet at Starbuck\\'s brain; still he knew that for all this the\\r\\nchief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain\\'s quest, and could he,\\r\\nwould joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.\\r\\nIt might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\\r\\nseen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall\\r\\ninto open relapses of rebellion against his captain\\'s leadership,\\r\\nunless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\\r\\nbrought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\\r\\nAhab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\\r\\nthan in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\\r\\nthe present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\\r\\nimaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\\r\\nterror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\\r\\nbackground (for few men\\'s courage is proof against protracted\\r\\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long\\r\\nnight watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\\r\\nthink of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the\\r\\nsavage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors\\r\\nof all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in\\r\\nthe varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when\\r\\nretained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\\r\\npromissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\\r\\nrequisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene\\r\\nand hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion\\r\\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are\\r\\nevanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the\\r\\nmanufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the\\r\\nWhite Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\\r\\nplaying round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\\r\\nknight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\\r\\nchase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,\\r\\ndaily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of\\r\\nold times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to\\r\\nfight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,\\r\\npicking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had\\r\\nthey been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that\\r\\nfinal and romantic object, too many would have turned from in\\r\\ndisgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of\\r\\ncash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,\\r\\nand no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same\\r\\nquiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\\r\\nsoon cashier Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\\r\\nto Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\\r\\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,\\r\\nhe had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\\r\\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\\r\\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\\r\\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.\\r\\nFrom even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the\\r\\npossible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,\\r\\nAhab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.  That\\r\\nprotection could only consist in his own predominating brain and\\r\\nheart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to\\r\\nevery minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew\\r\\nto be subjected to.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\\r\\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a\\r\\ngood degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but\\r\\nforce himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the\\r\\ngeneral pursuit of his profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the\\r\\nthree mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and\\r\\nnot omit reporting even a porpoise.  This vigilance was not long\\r\\nwithout reward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 47\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mat-Maker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\\r\\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured\\r\\nwaters.  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a\\r\\nsword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and\\r\\nsubdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an\\r\\nincantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor\\r\\nseemed resolved into his own invisible self.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I\\r\\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\\r\\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\\r\\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\\r\\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\\r\\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a\\r\\ndreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the\\r\\nsea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it\\r\\nseemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle\\r\\nmechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the\\r\\nfixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,\\r\\nunchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of\\r\\nthe crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.  This warp\\r\\nseemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own\\r\\nshuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.\\r\\nMeantime, Queequeg\\'s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting\\r\\nthe woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the\\r\\ncase might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow\\r\\nproducing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the\\r\\ncompleted fabric; this savage\\'s sword, thought I, which thus finally\\r\\nshapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword\\r\\nmust be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise\\r\\nincompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp\\r\\nof necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every\\r\\nalternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still\\r\\nfree to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though\\r\\nrestrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and\\r\\nsideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed\\r\\nto by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring\\r\\nblow at events.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\\r\\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball\\r\\nof free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the\\r\\nclouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.  High aloft in the\\r\\ncross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His body was reaching\\r\\neagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief\\r\\nsudden intervals he continued his cries.  To be sure the same sound\\r\\nwas that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from\\r\\nhundreds of whalemen\\'s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from\\r\\nfew of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a\\r\\nmarvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\\r\\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\\r\\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild\\r\\ncries announcing their coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where-away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly all was commotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\\r\\nreliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from\\r\\nother tribes of his genus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There go flukes!\" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quick, steward!\" cried Ahab.  \"Time! time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\\r\\nminute to Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\\r\\nbefore it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading\\r\\nto leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in\\r\\nadvance of our bows.  For that singular craft at times evinced by the\\r\\nSperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he\\r\\nnevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and\\r\\nswiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his\\r\\ncould not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that\\r\\nthe fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew\\r\\nat all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected for\\r\\nshipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time\\r\\nrelieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The sailors at the fore\\r\\nand mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places;\\r\\nthe cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three\\r\\nboats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high\\r\\ncliffs.  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand\\r\\nclung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the\\r\\ngunwale.  So look the long line of man-of-war\\'s men about to throw\\r\\nthemselves on board an enemy\\'s ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\\r\\nevery eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who\\r\\nwas surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Lowering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other\\r\\nside of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose\\r\\nthe tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had\\r\\nalways been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called\\r\\nthe captain\\'s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.\\r\\nThe figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one\\r\\nwhite tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.  A rumpled\\r\\nChinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide\\r\\nblack trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely crowning this\\r\\nebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair\\r\\nbraided and coiled round and round upon his head.  Less swart in\\r\\naspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,\\r\\ntiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of\\r\\nthe Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,\\r\\nand by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and\\r\\nsecret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,\\r\\nwhose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile yet the wondering ship\\'s company were gazing upon these\\r\\nstrangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their\\r\\nhead, \"All ready there, Fedallah?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ready,\" was the half-hissed reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lower away then; d\\'ye hear?\" shouting across the deck.  \"Lower away\\r\\nthere, I say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the\\r\\nmen sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks;\\r\\nwith a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a\\r\\ndexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the\\r\\nsailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship\\'s side into the\\r\\ntossed boats below.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship\\'s lee, when a fourth\\r\\nkeel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,\\r\\nand showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the\\r\\nstern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves\\r\\nwidely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.  But with all their\\r\\neyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates\\r\\nof the other boats obeyed not the command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab?--\" said Starbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spread yourselves,\" cried Ahab; \"give way, all four boats.  Thou,\\r\\nFlask, pull out more to leeward!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\\r\\ngreat steering oar.  \"Lay back!\" addressing his crew.\\r\\n\"There!--there!--there again!  There she blows right ahead,\\r\\nboys!--lay back!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind\\'em, sir,\" said Archy; \"I knew it all before now.\\r\\nDidn\\'t I hear \\'em in the hold?  And didn\\'t I tell Cabaco here of it?\\r\\nWhat say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\\r\\nones,\" drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of\\r\\nwhom still showed signs of uneasiness.  \"Why don\\'t you break your\\r\\nbackbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in yonder\\r\\nboat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands come to help us--never\\r\\nmind from where--the more the merrier.  Pull, then, do pull; never\\r\\nmind the brimstone--devils are good fellows enough.  So, so; there\\r\\nyou are now; that\\'s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that\\'s the\\r\\nstroke to sweep the stakes!  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my\\r\\nheroes!  Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don\\'t be\\r\\nin a hurry--don\\'t be in a hurry.  Why don\\'t you snap your oars, you\\r\\nrascals?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly,\\r\\nsoftly!  That\\'s it--that\\'s it! long and strong.  Give way there, give\\r\\nway!  The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all\\r\\nasleep.  Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,\\r\\ncan\\'t ye? pull, won\\'t ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and\\r\\nginger-cakes don\\'t ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and\\r\\nstart your eyes out!  Here!\" whipping out the sharp knife from his\\r\\ngirdle; \"every mother\\'s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the\\r\\nblade between his teeth.  That\\'s it--that\\'s it.  Now ye do something;\\r\\nthat looks like it, my steel-bits.  Start her--start her, my\\r\\nsilver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb\\'s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\\r\\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially\\r\\nin inculcating the religion of rowing.  But you must not suppose from\\r\\nthis specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright\\r\\npassions with his congregation.  Not at all; and therein consisted\\r\\nhis chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his\\r\\ncrew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury\\r\\nseemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman\\r\\ncould hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and\\r\\nyet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time\\r\\nlooked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his\\r\\nsteering-oar, and so broadly gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the\\r\\nmere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,\\r\\nacted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those\\r\\nodd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously\\r\\nambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of\\r\\nobeying them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\\r\\nacross Stubb\\'s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\\r\\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\\r\\nplease!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\\r\\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\\r\\nlike a flint from Stubb\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\\r\\nboys!)\" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \"A\\r\\nsad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never\\r\\nmind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,\\r\\ncome what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There\\'s hogsheads of sperm\\r\\nahead, Mr. Stubb, and that\\'s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)\\r\\nSperm, sperm\\'s the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit hand\\r\\nin hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought as much,\" soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\\r\\ndiverged, \"as soon as I clapt eye on \\'em, I thought so.  Aye, and\\r\\nthat\\'s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy\\r\\nlong suspected.  They were hidden down there.  The White Whale\\'s at\\r\\nthe bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!  Can\\'t be helped!  All\\r\\nright!  Give way, men!  It ain\\'t the White Whale to-day!  Give way!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical\\r\\ninstant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not\\r\\nunreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of\\r\\nthe ship\\'s company; but Archy\\'s fancied discovery having some time\\r\\nprevious got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this\\r\\nhad in some small measure prepared them for the event.  It took off\\r\\nthe extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and\\r\\nStubb\\'s confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were\\r\\nfor the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair\\r\\nstill left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to\\r\\ndark Ahab\\'s precise agency in the matter from the beginning.  For me,\\r\\nI silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on\\r\\nboard the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the\\r\\nenigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\\r\\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\\r\\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.  Those\\r\\ntiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like\\r\\nfive trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of\\r\\nstrength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a\\r\\nhorizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for\\r\\nFedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown\\r\\naside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole\\r\\npart of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the\\r\\nalternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end\\r\\nof the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer\\'s, thrown half backward\\r\\ninto the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was\\r\\nseen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat\\r\\nlowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at once the\\r\\noutstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,\\r\\nwhile the boat\\'s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.  Boat and\\r\\ncrew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in\\r\\nthe rear paused on their way.  The whales had irregularly settled\\r\\nbodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token\\r\\nof the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every man look out along his oars!\" cried Starbuck.  \"Thou,\\r\\nQueequeg, stand up!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the\\r\\nsavage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off\\r\\ntowards the spot where the chase had last been descried.  Likewise\\r\\nupon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly\\r\\nplatformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly\\r\\nand adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of\\r\\na craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot very far distant Flask\\'s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\\r\\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\\r\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\\r\\nthe level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns with\\r\\nthe whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a\\r\\nman\\'s hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed\\r\\nperched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her\\r\\ntrucks.  But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same\\r\\ntime little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that\\r\\nthis loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his\\r\\nway, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his\\r\\nlofty shoulders for a pedestal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\\r\\nfifty feet taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\\r\\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm\\r\\nto Flask\\'s foot, and then putting Flask\\'s hand on his hearse-plumed\\r\\nhead and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one\\r\\ndexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.\\r\\nAnd here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm\\r\\nfurnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself\\r\\nby.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what\\r\\nwondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an\\r\\nerect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most\\r\\nriotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see\\r\\nhim giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such\\r\\ncircumstances.  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic\\r\\nDaggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,\\r\\nindifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to\\r\\nevery roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.  On his\\r\\nbroad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer\\r\\nlooked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,\\r\\nostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;\\r\\nbut not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro\\'s lordly\\r\\nchest.  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living\\r\\nmagnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her\\r\\nseasons for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\\r\\nsolicitudes.  The whales might have made one of their regular\\r\\nsoundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were\\r\\nthe case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to\\r\\nsolace the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from\\r\\nhis hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.  He\\r\\nloaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly\\r\\nhad he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand,\\r\\nwhen Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to\\r\\nwindward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his\\r\\nerect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry,\\r\\n\"Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\\r\\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\\r\\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and\\r\\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\\r\\nrolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\\r\\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath\\r\\nthis atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin\\r\\nlayer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of\\r\\nall the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed\\r\\ntheir forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\\r\\nwater and air.  But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,\\r\\nas a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\\r\\nhills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pull, pull, my good boys,\" said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\\r\\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed\\r\\nglance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed\\r\\nas two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did\\r\\nnot say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to\\r\\nhim.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly\\r\\npierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now\\r\\nsoft with entreaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow different the loud little King-Post.  \"Sing out and say\\r\\nsomething, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!  Beach me,\\r\\nbeach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I\\'ll\\r\\nsign over to you my Martha\\'s Vineyard plantation, boys; including\\r\\nwife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I\\r\\nshall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that white water!\"  And so\\r\\nshouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on\\r\\nit; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally\\r\\nfell to rearing and plunging in the boat\\'s stern like a crazed colt\\r\\nfrom the prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at that chap now,\" philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\\r\\nunlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a\\r\\nshort distance, followed after--\"He\\'s got fits, that Flask has.\\r\\nFits? yes, give him fits--that\\'s the very word--pitch fits into \\'em.\\r\\nMerrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you\\r\\nknow;--merry\\'s the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.\\r\\nBut what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and\\r\\nsteadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack\\r\\nall your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that\\'s all.  Take it\\r\\neasy--why don\\'t ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and\\r\\nlungs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew\\r\\nof his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the\\r\\nblessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel sharks in\\r\\nthe audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado\\r\\nbrow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after\\r\\nhis prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific allusions of\\r\\nFlask to \"that whale,\" as he called the fictitious monster which he\\r\\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat\\'s bow with its\\r\\ntail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like,\\r\\nthat they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful\\r\\nlook over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the\\r\\noarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their\\r\\nnecks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and\\r\\nno limbs but arms, in these critical moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells of the\\r\\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\\r\\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\\r\\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\\r\\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that\\r\\nalmost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip\\r\\ninto the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to\\r\\ngain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down\\r\\nits other side;--all these, with the cries of the headsmen and\\r\\nharpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the\\r\\nwondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with\\r\\noutstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all\\r\\nthis was thrilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the\\r\\nfever heat of his first battle; not the dead man\\'s ghost encountering\\r\\nthe first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can\\r\\nfeel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the\\r\\nfirst time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of\\r\\nthe hunted sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and\\r\\nmore visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun\\r\\ncloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapour no longer\\r\\nblended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed\\r\\nseparating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck\\r\\ngiving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was\\r\\nnow set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat\\r\\ngoing with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could\\r\\nscarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the\\r\\nrow-locks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither\\r\\nship nor boat to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give way, men,\" whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\\r\\nsheet of his sail; \"there is time to kill a fish yet before the\\r\\nsquall comes.  There\\'s white water again!--close to!  Spring!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\\r\\nthat the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,\\r\\nwhen with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \"Stand\\r\\nup!\" and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death\\r\\nperil so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense\\r\\ncountenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the\\r\\nimminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing\\r\\nsound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the\\r\\nboat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and\\r\\nhissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!\" whispered Starbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron\\r\\nof Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push\\r\\nfrom astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the\\r\\nsail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near\\r\\nby; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The\\r\\nwhole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter\\r\\ninto the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and\\r\\nharpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the\\r\\niron, escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming\\r\\nround it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the\\r\\ngunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in\\r\\nthe sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our\\r\\ndownward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up\\r\\nto us from the bottom of the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers\\r\\ntogether; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us\\r\\nlike a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were\\r\\nburning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the\\r\\nother boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a\\r\\nflaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the\\r\\ndriving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\\r\\nno sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all\\r\\nattempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,\\r\\nperforming now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the\\r\\nlashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck\\r\\ncontrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a\\r\\nwaif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this\\r\\nforlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle\\r\\nin the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the\\r\\nsign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in\\r\\nthe midst of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or\\r\\nboat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still\\r\\nspread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of\\r\\nthe boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand\\r\\nto his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards\\r\\nhitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the\\r\\nthick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we\\r\\nall sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing\\r\\nright down upon us within a distance of not much more than its\\r\\nlength.\\r\\n\\r\\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant\\r\\nit tossed and gaped beneath the ship\\'s bows like a chip at the base\\r\\nof a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen\\r\\nno more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were\\r\\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\\r\\nlanded on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had\\r\\ncut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The\\r\\nship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light\\r\\nupon some token of our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 49\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hyena.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\\r\\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\\r\\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and\\r\\nmore than suspects that the joke is at nobody\\'s expense but his own.\\r\\nHowever, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.\\r\\nHe bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,\\r\\nall hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an\\r\\nostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.  And\\r\\nas for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden\\r\\ndisaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem\\r\\nto him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side\\r\\nbestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.  That odd sort of\\r\\nwayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of\\r\\nextreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,\\r\\nso that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most\\r\\nmomentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.  There is\\r\\nnothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort\\r\\nof genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this\\r\\nwhole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\\r\\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\\r\\nwater; \"Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\\r\\nhappen?\"  Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me,\\r\\nhe gave me to understand that such things did often happen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Stubb,\" said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\r\\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \"Mr. Stubb,\\r\\nI think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our\\r\\nchief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.  I\\r\\nsuppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set\\r\\nin a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman\\'s discretion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certain.  I\\'ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\\r\\nCape Horn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Flask,\" said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\\r\\nclose by; \"you are experienced in these things, and I am not.  Will\\r\\nyou tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr.\\r\\nFlask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself\\r\\nback-foremost into death\\'s jaws?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you twist that smaller?\" said Flask.  \"Yes, that\\'s the law.  I\\r\\nshould like to see a boat\\'s crew backing water up to a whale face\\r\\nforemost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\\r\\nthat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate\\r\\nstatement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls\\r\\nand capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,\\r\\nwere matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering\\r\\nthat at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I\\r\\nmust resign my life into the hands of him who steered the\\r\\nboat--oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his\\r\\nimpetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own\\r\\nfrantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our\\r\\nown particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck\\'s driving\\r\\non to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that\\r\\nStarbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in\\r\\nthe fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent\\r\\nStarbuck\\'s boat; and finally considering in what a devil\\'s chase I\\r\\nwas implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together,\\r\\nI say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of\\r\\nmy will.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"come along, you shall be my lawyer,\\r\\nexecutor, and legatee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\\r\\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\\r\\nmore fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth time in my nautical\\r\\nlife that I had done the same thing.  After the ceremony was\\r\\nconcluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone\\r\\nwas rolled away from my heart.  Besides, all the days I should now\\r\\nlive would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his\\r\\nresurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks\\r\\nas the case might be.  I survived myself; my death and burial were\\r\\nlocked up in my chest.  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly,\\r\\nlike a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of\\r\\na snug family vault.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my\\r\\nfrock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,\\r\\nand the devil fetch the hindmost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 50\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab\\'s Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who would have thought it, Flask!\" cried Stubb; \"if I had but one\\r\\nleg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the\\r\\nplug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he\\'s a wonderful old man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think it so strange, after all, on that account,\" said\\r\\nFlask.  \"If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different\\r\\nthing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of\\r\\nthe other left, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\\r\\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it\\r\\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\\r\\nperils of the chase.  So Tamerlane\\'s soldiers often argued with tears\\r\\nin their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be\\r\\ncarried into the thickest of the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considering\\r\\nthat with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of\\r\\ndanger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great\\r\\nand extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed,\\r\\nthen comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any\\r\\nmaimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing,\\r\\nthe joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little\\r\\nof his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes\\r\\nof the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and\\r\\ngiving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat\\r\\nactually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above\\r\\nall for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same\\r\\nboat\\'s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the\\r\\nheads of the owners of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a\\r\\nboat\\'s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on\\r\\nthat head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own\\r\\ntouching all that matter.  Until Cabaco\\'s published discovery, the\\r\\nsailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a\\r\\nlittle while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary\\r\\nbusiness of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after\\r\\nthis Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of\\r\\nmaking thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one\\r\\nof the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden\\r\\nskewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the\\r\\ngroove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and\\r\\nparticularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in\\r\\nthe bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed\\r\\npressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in\\r\\nexactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes\\r\\ncalled, the horizontal piece in the boat\\'s bow for bracing the knee\\r\\nagainst in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how\\r\\noften he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the\\r\\nsemi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter\\'s\\r\\nchisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there;\\r\\nall these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at\\r\\nthe time.  But almost everybody supposed that this particular\\r\\npreparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the\\r\\nultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\\r\\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a\\r\\nsupposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any\\r\\nboat\\'s crew being assigned to that boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\\r\\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then such\\r\\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the\\r\\nunknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating\\r\\noutlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer\\r\\ncastaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits\\r\\nof wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and\\r\\nwhat not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step\\r\\ndown into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create\\r\\nany unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\r\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it\\r\\nwere somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah\\r\\nremained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly\\r\\nworld like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced\\r\\nhimself to be linked with Ahab\\'s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to\\r\\nhave some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might\\r\\nhave been even authority over him; all this none knew.  But one\\r\\ncannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was such a\\r\\ncreature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see\\r\\nin their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and\\r\\nthen glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the\\r\\nOriental isles to the east of the continent--those insulated,\\r\\nimmemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days\\r\\nstill preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth\\'s primal\\r\\ngenerations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct\\r\\nrecollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,\\r\\neyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon\\r\\nwhy they were created and to what end; when though, according to\\r\\nGenesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the\\r\\ndevils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spirit-Spout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\\r\\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\\r\\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\\r\\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\\r\\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\\r\\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\\r\\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\\r\\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was\\r\\nseen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the\\r\\nmoon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god\\r\\nuprising from the sea.  Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of\\r\\nthese moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast\\r\\nhead, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it\\r\\nhad been day.  And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night,\\r\\nnot one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.  You\\r\\nmay think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old\\r\\nOriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the\\r\\nmoon, companions in one sky.  But when, after spending his uniform\\r\\ninterval there for several successive nights without uttering a\\r\\nsingle sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was\\r\\nheard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner\\r\\nstarted to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the\\r\\nrigging, and hailed the mortal crew.  \"There she blows!\"  Had the\\r\\ntrump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still\\r\\nthey felt no terror; rather pleasure.  For though it was a most\\r\\nunwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\\r\\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\\r\\nlowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\\r\\nt\\'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.  The\\r\\nbest man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every mast-head\\r\\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.  The strange,\\r\\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the\\r\\nhollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel\\r\\nlike air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two\\r\\nantagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct\\r\\nto heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.  And\\r\\nhad you watched Ahab\\'s face that night, you would have thought that\\r\\nin him also two different things were warring.  While his one live\\r\\nleg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb\\r\\nsounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.\\r\\nBut though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like\\r\\narrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen\\r\\nthat night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some\\r\\ndays after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:\\r\\nagain it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,\\r\\nonce more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served\\r\\nus night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.\\r\\nMysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the\\r\\ncase might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or\\r\\nthree; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be\\r\\nadvancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet\\r\\nseemed for ever alluring us on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\\r\\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things\\r\\ninvested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore\\r\\nthat whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in\\r\\nhowever far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was\\r\\ncast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time,\\r\\nthere reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting\\r\\napparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in\\r\\norder that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last\\r\\nin the remotest and most savage seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\\r\\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\\r\\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\\r\\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas\\r\\nso wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our\\r\\nvengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like\\r\\nprow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\\r\\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\\r\\nthat are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\\r\\nblast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\\r\\nsilver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\\r\\ndesolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\\r\\ndismal than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and\\r\\nthither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable\\r\\nsea-ravens.  And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these\\r\\nbirds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time\\r\\nobstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some\\r\\ndrifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and\\r\\ntherefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.  And heaved\\r\\nand heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast\\r\\ntides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish\\r\\nand remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.\\r\\n\\r\\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as\\r\\ncalled of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that\\r\\nbefore had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this\\r\\ntormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and\\r\\nthese fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any\\r\\nhaven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.  But\\r\\ncalm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of\\r\\nfeathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary\\r\\njet would at times be descried.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\\r\\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\\r\\ndeck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\\r\\naddressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these, after\\r\\neverything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done\\r\\nbut passively to await the issue of the gale.  Then Captain and crew\\r\\nbecome practical fatalists.  So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\\r\\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\\r\\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\\r\\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\\r\\neyelashes together.  Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part\\r\\nof the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\\r\\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\\r\\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\\r\\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a\\r\\nloosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as\\r\\nif manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through\\r\\nall the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.  By night\\r\\nthe same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean\\r\\nprevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still\\r\\nwordless Ahab stood up to the blast.  Even when wearied nature seemed\\r\\ndemanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.\\r\\nNever could Starbuck forget the old man\\'s aspect, when one night\\r\\ngoing down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him\\r\\nwith closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the\\r\\nrain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time\\r\\nbefore emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and\\r\\ncoat.  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of\\r\\ntides and currents which have previously been spoken of.  His lantern\\r\\nswung from his tightly clenched hand.  Though the body was erect, the\\r\\nhead was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the\\r\\nneedle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to\\r\\nthe compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself\\r\\nof the course of the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this\\r\\ngale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Albatross.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good\\r\\ncruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney\\r\\n(Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at\\r\\nthe fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to\\r\\na tyro in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent\\r\\nfrom home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\\r\\nskeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides, this spectral\\r\\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\\r\\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees\\r\\nfurred over with hoar-frost.  Only her lower sails were set.  A wild\\r\\nsight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three\\r\\nmast-heads.  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and\\r\\nbepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of\\r\\ncruising.  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and\\r\\nswung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided\\r\\nclose under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each\\r\\nother that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one\\r\\nship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,\\r\\nmildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own\\r\\nlook-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in\\r\\nthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his\\r\\nhand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove\\r\\nto make himself heard without it.  Meantime his ship was still\\r\\nincreasing the distance between.  While in various silent ways\\r\\nthe seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this\\r\\nominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale\\'s name\\r\\nto another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though\\r\\nhe would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the\\r\\nthreatening wind forbade.  But taking advantage of his windward\\r\\nposition, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that\\r\\nthe stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he\\r\\nloudly hailed--\"Ahoy there!  This is the Pequod, bound round the\\r\\nworld!  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!\\r\\nand this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address\\r\\nthem to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,\\r\\nthen, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small\\r\\nharmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming\\r\\nby our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged\\r\\nthemselves fore and aft with the stranger\\'s flanks.  Though in the\\r\\ncourse of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed\\r\\na similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles\\r\\ncapriciously carry meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Swim away from me, do ye?\" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the\\r\\nwater.  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed\\r\\nmore of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before\\r\\nevinced.  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding\\r\\nthe ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old\\r\\nlion voice,--\"Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRound the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire proud\\r\\nfeelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?  Only\\r\\nthrough numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where\\r\\nthose that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could\\r\\nfor ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and\\r\\nstrange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were\\r\\npromise in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we\\r\\ndream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time\\r\\nor other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this\\r\\nround globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave\\r\\nus whelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we\\r\\nhad spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.  But even had\\r\\nthis not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\\r\\nher--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it\\r\\nhad been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative\\r\\nanswer to the question he put.  For, as it eventually turned out, he\\r\\ncared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger\\r\\ncaptain, except he could contribute some of that information he so\\r\\nabsorbingly sought.  But all this might remain inadequately\\r\\nestimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of\\r\\nwhaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and\\r\\nespecially on a common cruising-ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\\r\\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\\r\\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\\r\\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a\\r\\nmoment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a\\r\\nwhile and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon\\r\\nthe illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two\\r\\nwhaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off\\r\\nlone Fanning\\'s Island, or the far away King\\'s Mills; how much more\\r\\nnatural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not\\r\\nonly interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\\r\\nsociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of\\r\\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\\r\\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\\r\\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things\\r\\nto talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters\\r\\non board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers\\r\\nof a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\\r\\nthumb-worn files.  And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\\r\\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\\r\\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\\r\\nimportance to her.  And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\\r\\nwhaling vessels crossing each other\\'s track on the cruising-ground\\r\\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one\\r\\nof them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and\\r\\nnow far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the\\r\\npeople of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would exchange the\\r\\nwhaling news, and have an agreeable chat.  For not only would they\\r\\nmeet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the\\r\\npeculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually\\r\\nshared privations and perils.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\\r\\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\\r\\nwith Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small\\r\\nnumber of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and\\r\\nwhen they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between\\r\\nthem; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he\\r\\ndoes not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides,\\r\\nthe English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan\\r\\nsuperiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean\\r\\nNantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of\\r\\nsea-peasant.  But where this superiority in the English whalemen\\r\\ndoes really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees\\r\\nin one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,\\r\\ncollectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in\\r\\nthe English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much\\r\\nto heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\\r\\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.  Whereas,\\r\\nsome merchant ships crossing each other\\'s wake in the mid-Atlantic,\\r\\nwill oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of\\r\\nrecognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a\\r\\nbrace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in\\r\\nfinical criticism upon each other\\'s rig.  As for Men-of-War, when\\r\\nthey chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of\\r\\nsilly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there\\r\\ndoes not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly\\r\\nlove about it at all.  As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are\\r\\nin such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as\\r\\npossible.  And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other\\'s\\r\\ncross-bones, the first hail is--\"How many skulls?\"--the same way that\\r\\nwhalers hail--\"How many barrels?\"  And that question once answered,\\r\\npirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on\\r\\nboth sides, and don\\'t like to see overmuch of each other\\'s villanous\\r\\nlikenesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\r\\nfree-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets another\\r\\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a \"GAM,\" a thing so\\r\\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\\r\\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\\r\\nand repeat gamesome stuff about \"spouters\" and \"blubber-boilers,\" and\\r\\nsuch like pretty exclamations.  Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,\\r\\nand also all Pirates and Man-of-War\\'s men, and Slave-ship sailors,\\r\\ncherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a\\r\\nquestion it would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of\\r\\npirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs\\r\\nhas any peculiar glory about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon\\r\\nelevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.  And besides, when a man\\r\\nis elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his\\r\\nsuperior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be\\r\\nhigh lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no\\r\\nsolid basis to stand on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is a GAM?  You might wear out your index-finger running up\\r\\nand down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.  Dr.\\r\\nJohnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster\\'s ark does not\\r\\nhold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many\\r\\nyears been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born\\r\\nYankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be\\r\\nincorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view, let me learnedly\\r\\ndefine it.\\r\\n\\r\\nGAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY\\r\\nON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE\\r\\nVISITS BY BOATS\\' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON\\r\\nBOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be\\r\\nforgotten here.  All professions have their own little peculiarities\\r\\nof detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate, man-of-war, or\\r\\nslave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always\\r\\nsits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat\\r\\nthere, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner\\'s\\r\\ntiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.  But the whale-boat has\\r\\nno seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.\\r\\nHigh times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water\\r\\non castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.  And as for a\\r\\ntiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and\\r\\ntherefore as in gamming a complete boat\\'s crew must leave the ship,\\r\\nand hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that\\r\\nsubordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\\r\\nhaving no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing\\r\\nlike a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious of\\r\\nthe eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of\\r\\nthe two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance\\r\\nof sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  Nor is this any\\r\\nvery easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering\\r\\noar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar\\r\\nreciprocating by rapping his knees in front.  He is thus completely\\r\\nwedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by\\r\\nsettling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of\\r\\nthe boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\\r\\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.  Merely make a\\r\\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then,\\r\\nagain, it would never do in plain sight of the world\\'s riveted eyes,\\r\\nit would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen\\r\\nsteadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything\\r\\nwith his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,\\r\\nhe generally carries his hands in his trowsers\\' pockets; but perhaps\\r\\nbeing generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for\\r\\nballast.  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well\\r\\nauthenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an\\r\\nuncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize\\r\\nhold of the nearest oarsman\\'s hair, and hold on there like grim\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town-Ho\\'s Story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,\\r\\nis much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you\\r\\nmeet more travellers than in any other part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\\r\\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.  She was\\r\\nmanned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that ensued\\r\\nshe gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general interest\\r\\nin the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the\\r\\nTown-Ho\\'s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a\\r\\ncertain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called\\r\\njudgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.  This\\r\\nlatter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming\\r\\nwhat may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be\\r\\nnarrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.  For\\r\\nthat secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the\\r\\nTown-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three confederate\\r\\nwhite seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to\\r\\nTashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night\\r\\nTashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that\\r\\nway, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.\\r\\nNevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those\\r\\nseamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by\\r\\nsuch a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this\\r\\nmatter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never\\r\\ntranspired abaft the Pequod\\'s main-mast.  Interweaving in its proper\\r\\nplace this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the\\r\\nship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on\\r\\nlasting record.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the\\r\\nmast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos\\r\\nterrapin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my humor\\'s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\\r\\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\\r\\nsaint\\'s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\\r\\nInn.  Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,\\r\\nwere on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions\\r\\nthey occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am\\r\\nabout rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of\\r\\nNantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\\'\\r\\nsail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was\\r\\nsomewhere to the northward of the Line.  One morning upon handling\\r\\nthe pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made\\r\\nmore water in her hold than common.  They supposed a sword-fish had\\r\\nstabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain, having some unusual reason\\r\\nfor believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and\\r\\ntherefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then\\r\\nconsidered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it\\r\\nafter searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy\\r\\nweather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working\\r\\nat the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more\\r\\ndays went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it\\r\\nsensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm, the\\r\\ncaptain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the\\r\\nislands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\\r\\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\\r\\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\\r\\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep\\r\\nthe ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.  In\\r\\ntruth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very\\r\\nprosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in\\r\\nperfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least\\r\\nfatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the\\r\\nmate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,\\r\\na Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\\'\\r\\nsaid Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your\\r\\ncourtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.  Now,\\r\\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\\r\\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\\r\\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had\\r\\nyet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions\\r\\npopularly connected with the open ocean.  For in their interflowing\\r\\naggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,\\r\\nand Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like\\r\\nexpansiveness, with many of the ocean\\'s noblest traits; with many of\\r\\nits rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain round\\r\\narchipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in\\r\\nlarge part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the\\r\\nAtlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous\\r\\nterritorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;\\r\\nhere and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like\\r\\ncraggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings\\r\\nof naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild\\r\\nbarbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry\\r\\nwigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered\\r\\nforests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in\\r\\nGothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of\\r\\nprey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar\\r\\nEmperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as\\r\\nwell as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant\\r\\nship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech\\r\\ncanoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as\\r\\nany that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out\\r\\nof sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a\\r\\nmidnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though\\r\\nan inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;\\r\\nas much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in\\r\\nhis infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to\\r\\nnurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed\\r\\nour austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite\\r\\nas vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh\\r\\nfrom the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this\\r\\nNantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a\\r\\nmariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible\\r\\nfirmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition\\r\\nwhich is the meanest slave\\'s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had\\r\\nlong been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved\\r\\nso thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,\\r\\ngentlemen, you shall hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\\r\\nprow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho\\'s leak seemed again\\r\\nincreasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\\r\\nevery day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like\\r\\nour Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping\\r\\ntheir whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should\\r\\nthe officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,\\r\\nthe probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\\r\\nremember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\\r\\nNor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\\r\\ngentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at\\r\\ntheir pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable\\r\\nlength; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if\\r\\nany other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a\\r\\nleaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,\\r\\nsome really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a\\r\\nlittle anxious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was\\r\\nfound gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern\\r\\nmanifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.\\r\\nHe commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,\\r\\nand every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,\\r\\nwas as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of\\r\\nnervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,\\r\\nunthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently\\r\\nimagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about\\r\\nthe safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only\\r\\non account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were\\r\\nworking that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\\r\\ngamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\\r\\ncontinually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\\r\\nmountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across\\r\\nthe deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee\\r\\nscupper-holes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this\\r\\nconventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person\\r\\nplaced in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very\\r\\nsignificantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway\\r\\nagainst that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and\\r\\nbitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize\\r\\nthat subaltern\\'s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be\\r\\nthis conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt\\r\\nwas a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing\\r\\ngolden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy\\'s\\r\\nsnorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,\\r\\ngentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son\\r\\nto Charlemagne\\'s father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;\\r\\nyet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,\\r\\nand Steelkilt knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\\r\\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on\\r\\nwith his gay banterings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\\'s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\\r\\none of ye, and let\\'s have a taste.  By the Lord, it\\'s worth bottling!\\r\\nI tell ye what, men, old Rad\\'s investment must go for it! he had\\r\\nbest cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,\\r\\nboys, that sword-fish only began the job; he\\'s come back again with a\\r\\ngang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and\\r\\nthe whole posse of \\'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at\\r\\nthe bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here\\r\\nnow, I\\'d tell him to jump overboard and scatter \\'em.  They\\'re playing\\r\\nthe devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he\\'s a simple old\\r\\nsoul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his\\r\\nproperty is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he\\'d give a\\r\\npoor devil like me the model of his nose.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Damn your eyes! what\\'s that pump stopping for?\\' roared Radney,\\r\\npretending not to have heard the sailors\\' talk.  \\'Thunder away at\\r\\nit!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Aye, aye, sir,\\' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  \\'Lively, boys,\\r\\nlively, now!\\'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\\r\\nfire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\\r\\npeculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\\r\\ntension of life\\'s utmost energies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\\r\\nwent forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his\\r\\nface fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from\\r\\nhis brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\\r\\nRadney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\\r\\nstate, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\\r\\nthe deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\\r\\nplanks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\\r\\nconsequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\\'s deck at sea is a piece of\\r\\nhousehold work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\\r\\nattended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\\r\\nof ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\\r\\ninflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\\r\\nseamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\\r\\ntheir faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\\r\\nprescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\\r\\nit was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\\r\\ngangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\\r\\nof them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\\r\\nthe gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\\r\\nbusiness not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\\r\\ncase with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\\r\\nmay understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\\r\\nas plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\\r\\nspat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\\r\\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\\r\\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\\r\\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate\\'s\\r\\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\\r\\nhim and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\\r\\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\\r\\nunwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\\r\\nireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\\r\\nvaliant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\\r\\ngentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\\r\\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\\r\\nsweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\\r\\nthen, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\\r\\nlads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\\r\\npumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\\r\\nwith an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\\r\\nunconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the\\r\\nstill seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper\\'s club hammer which he\\r\\nhad snatched from a cask near by.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,\\r\\nfor all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating\\r\\nSteelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow\\r\\nstill smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\\r\\nremained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed\\r\\nRadney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\\r\\ncommanding him to do his bidding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\\r\\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\\r\\nhis intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\\r\\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\\r\\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\\r\\nwas to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\\r\\nthe windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking\\r\\nhim that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\\r\\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\\r\\nyourself.\\'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\\r\\nwhere the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\\r\\ninch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\\r\\nmaledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\\r\\nstabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\\r\\nSteelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\\r\\nit back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek\\r\\nhe (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been\\r\\nbranded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer\\r\\ntouched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was\\r\\nstove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\\r\\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\\r\\nmastheads.  They were both Canallers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Canallers!\\' cried Don Pedro.  \\'We have seen many whale-ships in our\\r\\nharbours, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon: who and what are\\r\\nthey?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\\r\\nYou must have heard of it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and\\r\\nhereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha\\'s very fine; and\\r\\nere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for\\r\\nsuch information may throw side-light upon my story.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\\r\\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities\\r\\nand most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps,\\r\\nand affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by\\r\\nbilliard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great\\r\\nforests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;\\r\\nby happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery\\r\\nof those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white\\r\\nchapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one\\r\\ncontinual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life.\\r\\nThere\\'s your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where\\r\\nyou ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,\\r\\nand the snug patronising lee of churches.  For by some curious\\r\\nfatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that\\r\\nthey ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen,\\r\\nmost abound in holiest vicinities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is that a friar passing?\\' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into\\r\\nthe crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\\'s Inquisition wanes in\\r\\nLima,\\' laughed Don Sebastian.  \\'Proceed, Senor.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A moment!  Pardon!\\' cried another of the company.  \\'In the name of\\r\\nall us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we\\r\\nhave by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present\\r\\nLima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow\\r\\nand look surprised; you know the proverb all along this\\r\\ncoast--\"Corrupt as Lima.\"  It but bears out your saying, too;\\r\\nchurches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open--and\\r\\n\"Corrupt as Lima.\"  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city\\r\\nof the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your\\r\\ncup!  Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\\r\\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\\r\\nhe.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,\\r\\nflowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his\\r\\nred-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny\\r\\ndeck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.  The brigandish\\r\\nguise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and\\r\\ngaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.  A terror to the\\r\\nsmiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart\\r\\nvisage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond\\r\\non his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these\\r\\nCanallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it\\r\\nis often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of\\r\\nviolence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor\\r\\nstranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.  In sum,\\r\\ngentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically\\r\\nevinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its\\r\\nmost finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except\\r\\nSydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.  Nor does\\r\\nit at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many\\r\\nthousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the\\r\\nprobationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition\\r\\nbetween quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly\\r\\nploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I see!  I see!\\' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his\\r\\nchicha upon his silvery ruffles.  \\'No need to travel!  The world\\'s\\r\\none Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the\\r\\ngenerations were cold and holy as the hills.--But the story.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.\\r\\nHardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior\\r\\nmates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.  But\\r\\nsliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed\\r\\ninto the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the\\r\\nforecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,\\r\\nand a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm\\'s way, the\\r\\nvaliant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon\\r\\nhis officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him\\r\\nalong to the quarter-deck.  At intervals, he ran close up to the\\r\\nrevolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it\\r\\nwith his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.  But\\r\\nSteelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they\\r\\nsucceeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing\\r\\nabout three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these\\r\\nsea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come out of that, ye pirates!\\' roared the captain, now menacing\\r\\nthem with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.\\r\\n\\'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\\r\\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\\r\\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\\'s) death would be the\\r\\nsignal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.  Fearing in\\r\\nhis heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little\\r\\ndesisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to\\r\\ntheir duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\\' demanded their\\r\\nringleader.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!  Do you want\\r\\nto sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?  Turn to!\\' and\\r\\nhe once more raised a pistol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Sink the ship?\\' cried Steelkilt.  \\'Aye, let her sink.  Not a man of\\r\\nus turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.\\r\\nWhat say ye, men?\\' turning to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was their\\r\\nresponse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his\\r\\neye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--\\'It\\'s\\r\\nnot our fault; we didn\\'t want it; I told him to take his hammer away;\\r\\nit was boy\\'s business; he might have known me before this; I told him\\r\\nnot to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here\\r\\nagainst his cursed jaw; ain\\'t those mincing knives down in the\\r\\nforecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.\\r\\nCaptain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don\\'t be a fool;\\r\\nforget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we\\'re\\r\\nyour men; but we won\\'t be flogged.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Look ye, now,\\' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\\r\\n\\'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped\\r\\nfor the cruise, d\\'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\\r\\ndischarge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don\\'t want a row; it\\'s\\r\\nnot our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but\\r\\nwe won\\'t be flogged.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to!\\' roared the Captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--\\'I tell you\\r\\nwhat it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a\\r\\nshabby rascal, we won\\'t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;\\r\\nbut till you say the word about not flogging us, we don\\'t do a hand\\'s\\r\\nturn.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I\\'ll keep ye there\\r\\ntill ye\\'re sick of it.  Down ye go.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Shall we?\\' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them were\\r\\nagainst it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded\\r\\nhim down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears\\r\\ninto a cave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As the Lakeman\\'s bare head was just level with the planks, the\\r\\nCaptain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over\\r\\nthe slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and\\r\\nloudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock\\r\\nbelonging to the companionway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down\\r\\nthe crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in\\r\\nnumber--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\\r\\nremained neutral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward\\r\\nand aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;\\r\\nat which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\\r\\nbreaking through the bulkhead below.  But the hours of darkness\\r\\npassed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling\\r\\nhard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through\\r\\nthe dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\\r\\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.  Water\\r\\nwas then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit\\r\\nwere tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and\\r\\npocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.  Twice every\\r\\nday for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a\\r\\nconfused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary\\r\\nsummons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the\\r\\nforecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.  The fetid closeness\\r\\nof the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of\\r\\nultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at\\r\\ndiscretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to\\r\\nthe rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his\\r\\nbabbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning\\r\\nthree others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the\\r\\ndesperate arms below that sought to restrain them.  Only three were\\r\\nleft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Better turn to, now?\\' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Shut us up again, will ye!\\' cried Steelkilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh certainly,\\' the Captain, and the key clicked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\\r\\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that\\r\\nhad last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place\\r\\nas black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt\\r\\nproposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with\\r\\nhim, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the\\r\\ngarrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,\\r\\nheavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the\\r\\nbowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation\\r\\npossible, seize the ship.  For himself, he would do this, he said,\\r\\nwhether they joined him or not.  That was the last night he should\\r\\nspend in that den.  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part\\r\\nof the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any\\r\\nother mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was\\r\\nmore, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the\\r\\ntime to make the rush should come.  But to this their leader as\\r\\nfiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly\\r\\nas his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the\\r\\nmatter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but\\r\\nadmit one man at a time.  And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these\\r\\nmiscreants must come out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\\r\\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same\\r\\npiece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in\\r\\norder to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to\\r\\nsurrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such\\r\\nconduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his determination\\r\\nstill to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle\\r\\nchemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;\\r\\nand when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls\\r\\nto each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,\\r\\nand gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at\\r\\nmidnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\\r\\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.\\r\\nIn a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,\\r\\nthe still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his\\r\\nperfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man\\r\\nwho had been fully ripe for murder.  But all these were collared, and\\r\\ndragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were\\r\\nseized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and\\r\\nthere they hung till morning.  \\'Damn ye,\\' cried the Captain, pacing\\r\\nto and fro before them, \\'the vultures would not touch ye, ye\\r\\nvillains!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\\r\\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\\r\\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon\\r\\nthe whole, he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for\\r\\nthe present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go\\r\\nwith a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\\' turning to the three men in the\\r\\nrigging--\\'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;\\' and,\\r\\nseizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the\\r\\ntwo traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their\\r\\nheads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'My wrist is sprained with ye!\\' he cried, at last; \\'but there is\\r\\nstill rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn\\'t give\\r\\nup.  Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say\\r\\nfor himself.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\\r\\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\\r\\nsort of hiss, \\'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me,\\r\\nI murder you!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me\\'--and the Captain drew off\\r\\nwith the rope to strike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Best not,\\' hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But I must,\\'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the\\r\\nCaptain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the\\r\\ndeck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his\\r\\nrope, said, \\'I won\\'t do it--let him go--cut him down: d\\'ye hear?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\\r\\nman, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.\\r\\nEver since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,\\r\\nhearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had\\r\\nwatched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth, that he\\r\\ncould hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing\\r\\nand able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the\\r\\nrope and advanced to his pinioned foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You are a coward!\\' hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'So I am, but take that.\\'  The mate was in the very act of striking,\\r\\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He paused: and then\\r\\npausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt\\'s threat,\\r\\nwhatever that might have been.  The three men were then cut down, all\\r\\nhands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the\\r\\niron pumps clanged as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\\r\\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running\\r\\nup, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the\\r\\ncrew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at\\r\\ntheir own instance they were put down in the ship\\'s run for\\r\\nsalvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.  On\\r\\nthe contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt\\'s instigation, they\\r\\nhad resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders\\r\\nto the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.\\r\\nBut in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all\\r\\nagreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case\\r\\nany should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her\\r\\nother perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her\\r\\ncaptain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on\\r\\nthe day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate\\r\\nwas quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his\\r\\nbandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\r\\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\\r\\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\\r\\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.  He was in\\r\\nRadney the chief mate\\'s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to\\r\\nrun more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the\\r\\nrigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,\\r\\nupon resuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one or\\r\\ntwo other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of\\r\\nhis revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\\r\\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\\r\\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship\\'s side.\\r\\nIn this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.  There was a\\r\\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\\r\\nthis was the sea.  Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\\r\\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o\\'clock, in the\\r\\nmorning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.  At\\r\\nhis leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very\\r\\ncarefully in his watches below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What are you making there?\\' said a shipmate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you think? what does it look like?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\\'s an odd one, seems to me.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Yes, rather oddish,\\' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm\\'s length\\r\\nbefore him; \\'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven\\'t enough\\r\\ntwine,--have you any?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there was none in the forecastle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then I must get some from old Rad;\\' and he rose to go aft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You don\\'t mean to go a begging to HIM!\\' said a sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why not?  Do you think he won\\'t do me a turn, when it\\'s to help\\r\\nhimself in the end, shipmate?\\' and going to the mate, he looked at\\r\\nhim quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.  It\\r\\nwas given him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the\\r\\nnext night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the\\r\\npocket of the Lakeman\\'s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat\\r\\ninto his hammock for a pillow.  Twenty-four hours after, his trick at\\r\\nthe silent helm--nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave\\r\\nalways ready dug to the seaman\\'s hand--that fatal hour was then to\\r\\ncome; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was\\r\\nalready stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed\\r\\nin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\\r\\ndeed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had, and without being\\r\\nthe avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to\\r\\nstep in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he\\r\\nwould have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the\\r\\nsecond day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid\\r\\nTeneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted\\r\\nout, \\'There she rolls! there she rolls!\\'  Jesu, what a whale!  It was\\r\\nMoby Dick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Moby Dick!\\' cried Don Sebastian; \\'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor, but do\\r\\nwhales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,\\r\\nDon;--but that would be too long a story.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'How? how?\\' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.  Let me get\\r\\nmore into the air, Sirs.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The chicha! the chicha!\\' cried Don Pedro; \\'our vigorous friend looks\\r\\nfaint;--fill up his empty glass!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen, so\\r\\nsuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\\r\\nship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of\\r\\nthe moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily\\r\\nlifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it\\r\\nhad been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was\\r\\nnow a phrensy.  \\'The White Whale--the White Whale!\\' was the cry from\\r\\ncaptain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,\\r\\nwere all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the\\r\\ndogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of\\r\\nthe vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,\\r\\nshifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.\\r\\nGentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these\\r\\nevents, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.\\r\\nThe mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it\\r\\nwas his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in\\r\\nthe prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.\\r\\nMoreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate\\'s got the start;\\r\\nand none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he\\r\\nstrained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast,\\r\\nand, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was always a\\r\\nfurious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to\\r\\nbeach him on the whale\\'s topmost back.  Nothing loath, his bowsman\\r\\nhauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two\\r\\nwhitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a\\r\\nsunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.  That\\r\\ninstant, as he fell on the whale\\'s slippery back, the boat righted,\\r\\nand was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into\\r\\nthe sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the\\r\\nspray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\\r\\nseeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale\\r\\nrushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his\\r\\njaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat\\'s bottom, the Lakeman had\\r\\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\\r\\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,\\r\\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.\\r\\nHe cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance, Moby Dick\\r\\nrose again, with some tatters of Radney\\'s red woollen shirt, caught\\r\\nin the teeth that had destroyed him.  All four boats gave chase\\r\\nagain; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary\\r\\nplace--where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the\\r\\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately\\r\\ndeserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a\\r\\nlarge double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some\\r\\nother harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ship\\'s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain\\r\\ncalled upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of\\r\\nheaving down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting\\r\\nvigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites\\r\\nnecessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard\\r\\nwork they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,\\r\\nthey were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put\\r\\noff with them in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his\\r\\nofficers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded\\r\\nand ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the\\r\\npoop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their\\r\\nperil, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best\\r\\nwhale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred\\r\\nmiles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\\r\\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.  He steered away from\\r\\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\\r\\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.\\r\\nThe captain presented a pistol.  With one foot on each prow of the\\r\\nyoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that\\r\\nif the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in\\r\\nbubbles and foam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you want of me?\\' cried the captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?\\' demanded\\r\\nSteelkilt; \\'no lies.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.\\'  With that\\r\\nhe leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\\r\\nstood face to face with the captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me.\\r\\nAs soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\\r\\nisland, and remain there six days.  If I do not, may lightning strike\\r\\nme!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A pretty scholar,\\' laughed the Lakeman.  \\'Adios, Senor!\\' and\\r\\nleaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\\r\\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\\r\\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck\\r\\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\\r\\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the\\r\\nsailor headed.  They embarked; and so for ever got the start of\\r\\ntheir former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal\\r\\nretribution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\\r\\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\\r\\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.  Chartering a small\\r\\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\\r\\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\\r\\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses\\r\\nto give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\\r\\ndestroyed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Are you through?\\' said Don Sebastian, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am, Don.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,\\r\\nthis your story is in substance really true?

It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\\r\\nthose curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\\r\\npresent day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\\r\\ntime to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\\r\\nof the whale all wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\\r\\nwill be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\\r\\nsculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\\r\\nwhen on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\\r\\nand on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\\r\\nscales of chain-armor like Saladin\\'s, and a helmeted head like St.\\r\\nGeorge\\'s; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\\r\\nprevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\\r\\nmany scientific presentations of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\\r\\nto be the whale\\'s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\\r\\nElephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\\r\\nendless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\\r\\npursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\\r\\nbefore any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\\r\\nsome sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\\r\\nshadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\\r\\ndepartment of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\\r\\nform of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\\r\\nthis sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\\r\\ntail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It\\r\\nlooks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms\\r\\nof the true whale\\'s majestic flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\\r\\npainter\\'s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\\r\\nantediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido\\'s picture of Perseus rescuing\\r\\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the\\r\\nmodel of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in\\r\\npainting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one\\r\\nwhit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\\r\\nundulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\\r\\na sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\\r\\nwhich the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors\\' Gate\\r\\nleading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\\r\\nProdromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah\\'s whale, as\\r\\ndepicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\\r\\nWhat shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder\\'s whale winding\\r\\nlike a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\\r\\nand gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\\r\\nnew--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\\r\\nimitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\\r\\nuniversally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\\r\\nbook-binder\\'s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\\r\\nwhen the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\\r\\nItalian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\\r\\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\\r\\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\\r\\nspecies of the Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\\r\\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\\r\\nmanner of spouts, jets d\\'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\\r\\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the\\r\\ntitle-page of the original edition of the \"Advancement of Learning\"\\r\\nyou will find some curious whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at\\r\\nthose pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific\\r\\ndelineations, by those who know.  In old Harris\\'s collection of\\r\\nvoyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book\\r\\nof voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\\r\\nthe ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\\r\\nIn one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\\r\\nrepresented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\\r\\ntheir living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\\r\\nof representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\\r\\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\\r\\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\\r\\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.\"  In this book is an outline purporting\\r\\nto be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\\r\\nfrom one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\\r\\ndeck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\\r\\nthe benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\\r\\nme say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\\r\\naccompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\\r\\nof that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant\\r\\ncaptain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\\r\\n\\r\\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\\r\\nthe benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\\r\\nof mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith\\'s Animated Nature.\"\\r\\nIn the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\\r\\nalleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\\r\\nbut this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\\r\\nfor the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\\r\\nthis nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\\r\\nupon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\\r\\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\\r\\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All\\r\\nthese are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\\r\\nGreenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\\r\\nlong experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\\r\\nits counterpart in nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\\r\\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\\r\\nBaron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which\\r\\nhe gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\\r\\nthat picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your\\r\\nsummary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier\\'s Sperm\\r\\nWhale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had\\r\\nthe benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\\r\\nderived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\\r\\nscientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\\r\\nauthentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\\r\\nof lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and\\r\\nsaucers inform us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the sign-painters\\' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\\r\\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally\\r\\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\\r\\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full\\r\\nof mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\\r\\npaint.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\\r\\nsurprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\\r\\nhave been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\\r\\ncorrect as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\\r\\ncorrectly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\\r\\nof hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\\r\\nfull-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\\r\\nhimself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\\r\\nsignificance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\\r\\nafloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\\r\\nline-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\\r\\nimpossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\\r\\npreserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\\r\\nthe highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\\r\\nwhale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\\r\\none of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship\\'s deck, such is\\r\\nthen the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\\r\\nhis precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\\r\\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\\r\\nall.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\\r\\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\\r\\nThough Jeremy Bentham\\'s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\\r\\nlibrary of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\\r\\nburly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\\'s other\\r\\nleading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\\r\\ninferred from any leviathan\\'s articulated bones.  In fact, as the\\r\\ngreat Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\\r\\nrelation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\\r\\nto the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\\r\\nis strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\\r\\nbe incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\\r\\nside fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\\r\\nhuman hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\\r\\nbone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\\r\\nthese are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\\r\\nfingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\\r\\nsometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be\\r\\ntruly said to handle us without mittens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must\\r\\nneeds conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the\\r\\nworld which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait\\r\\nmay hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\\r\\nany very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\\r\\nway of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And\\r\\nthe only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\\r\\nliving contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you\\r\\nrun no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.\\r\\nWherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your\\r\\ncuriosity touching this Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of\\r\\nWhaling Scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\\r\\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\\r\\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\\r\\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I\\r\\npass that matter by.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\\r\\nColnett\\'s, Huggins\\'s, Frederick Cuvier\\'s, and Beale\\'s.  In the\\r\\nprevious chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.  Huggins\\'s\\r\\nis far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale\\'s is the best.\\r\\nAll Beale\\'s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle\\r\\nfigure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping\\r\\nhis second chapter.  His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales,\\r\\nthough no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some\\r\\nparlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.\\r\\nSome of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.  Ross Browne are pretty\\r\\ncorrect in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved.  That is not\\r\\nhis fault though.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but\\r\\nthey are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.\\r\\nHe has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad\\r\\ndeficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well\\r\\ndone, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living\\r\\nwhale as seen by his living hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\\r\\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to\\r\\nbe anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,\\r\\nand taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they\\r\\nrepresent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first\\r\\nengraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\\r\\njust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\\r\\nbearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the\\r\\nstoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is\\r\\ndrawn just balancing upon the monster\\'s spine; and standing in that\\r\\nprow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an\\r\\noarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,\\r\\nand in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the\\r\\nwhole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub\\r\\nfloats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\\r\\nobliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\\r\\nabout the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\\r\\nblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\\r\\nSerious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\\r\\nwhale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw\\r\\nso good a one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\\r\\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\\r\\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\\r\\nPatagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\\r\\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\\r\\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls\\r\\nare pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\\r\\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\\r\\nback.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing\\r\\nthrough the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,\\r\\nand causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught\\r\\nnigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is\\r\\nall raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is\\r\\nthe glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of\\r\\nthe powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\\r\\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\\r\\ninserted into his spout-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life for it\\r\\nhe was either practically conversant with his subject, or else\\r\\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.  The French are\\r\\nthe lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of\\r\\nEurope, and where will you find such a gallery of living and\\r\\nbreathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at\\r\\nVersailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the\\r\\nconsecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash\\r\\nof the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors\\r\\ndash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a\\r\\nplace in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\\r\\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and\\r\\nengravings they have of their whaling scenes.  With not one tenth of\\r\\nEngland\\'s experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of\\r\\nthat of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations\\r\\nwith the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real\\r\\nspirit of the whale hunt.  For the most part, the English and\\r\\nAmerican whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the\\r\\nmechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the\\r\\nwhale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is\\r\\nabout tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even\\r\\nScoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff\\r\\nfull length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate\\r\\nminiatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of\\r\\nclassical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;\\r\\nand with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the\\r\\ninspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified\\r\\nArctic snow crystals.  I mean no disparagement to the excellent\\r\\nvoyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it\\r\\nwas certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a\\r\\nsworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two\\r\\nother French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes\\r\\nhimself \"H.  Durand.\"  One of them, though not precisely adapted to\\r\\nour present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.\\r\\nIt is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French\\r\\nwhaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on\\r\\nboard; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the\\r\\npalms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless\\r\\nair.  The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its\\r\\npresenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of\\r\\noriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:\\r\\nthe ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the\\r\\nLeviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the\\r\\nact of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a\\r\\nboat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about\\r\\ngiving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons and lances lie\\r\\nlevelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its\\r\\nhole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\\r\\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.  From the ship,\\r\\nthe smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the\\r\\nsmoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,\\r\\nrising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the\\r\\nactivity of the excited seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in\\r\\nMountains; in Stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen\\r\\na crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted\\r\\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\\r\\nleg.  There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\\r\\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)\\r\\nis being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any time these\\r\\nten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and\\r\\nexhibited that stump to an incredulous world.  But the time of his\\r\\njustification has now come.  His three whales are as good whales as\\r\\nwere ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as\\r\\nunquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.\\r\\nBut, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech\\r\\ndoes the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully\\r\\ncontemplating his own amputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and\\r\\nSag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\\r\\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\\r\\nWhale-teeth, or ladies\\' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,\\r\\nand other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the\\r\\nnumerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of\\r\\nthe rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.  Some of them\\r\\nhave little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially\\r\\nintended for the skrimshandering business.  But, in general, they\\r\\ntoil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent\\r\\ntool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in\\r\\nthe way of a mariner\\'s fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a\\r\\nman to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called\\r\\nsavagery.  Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.\\r\\nI myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\\r\\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his\\r\\ndomestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry.  An ancient\\r\\nHawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and\\r\\nelaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as\\r\\na Latin lexicon.  For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a\\r\\nshark\\'s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been\\r\\nachieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.  With\\r\\nthe same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark\\'s tooth,\\r\\nof his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone\\r\\nsculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its\\r\\nmaziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles\\'s shield; and full\\r\\nof barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old\\r\\nDutch savage, Albert Durer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs\\r\\nof the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the\\r\\nforecastles of American whalers.  Some of them are done with much\\r\\naccuracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales\\r\\nhung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door.  When the porter\\r\\nis sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.  But these knocking\\r\\nwhales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.  On the spires of\\r\\nsome old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed\\r\\nthere for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that\\r\\nare to all intents and purposes so labelled with \"HANDS OFF!\" you\\r\\ncannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\\r\\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the\\r\\nplain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of\\r\\nthe Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks\\r\\nagainst them in a surf of green surges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\\r\\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\\r\\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\\r\\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.  But you must\\r\\nbe a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but\\r\\nif you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and\\r\\ntake the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first\\r\\nstand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills,\\r\\nthat your precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious\\r\\nre-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita,\\r\\nthough once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera\\r\\nchronicled them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace\\r\\nout great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them;\\r\\nas when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw\\r\\narmies locked in battle among the clouds.  Thus at the North have I\\r\\nchased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the\\r\\nbright points that first defined him to me.  And beneath the\\r\\neffulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined\\r\\nthe chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of\\r\\nHydrus and the Flying Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a frigate\\'s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons\\r\\nfor spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies,\\r\\nto see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents\\r\\nreally lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nBrit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast\\r\\nmeadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right\\r\\nWhale largely feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us,\\r\\nso that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and\\r\\ngolden wheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure\\r\\nfrom the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws\\r\\nsluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing\\r\\nfibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that\\r\\nmanner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance\\r\\ntheir scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so\\r\\nthese monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and\\r\\nleaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the \"Brazil Banks\" does\\r\\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\\r\\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\\r\\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\\r\\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at\\r\\nall reminded one of mowers.  Seen from the mast-heads, especially\\r\\nwhen they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black\\r\\nforms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else.\\r\\nAnd as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a\\r\\ndistance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants\\r\\nwithout knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened\\r\\nelevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first\\r\\ntime beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.  And even\\r\\nwhen recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very\\r\\nhard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can\\r\\npossibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that\\r\\nlives in a dog or a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\\r\\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore.  For\\r\\nthough some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the\\r\\nland are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general\\r\\nview of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties,\\r\\nwhere, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in\\r\\ndisposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog?  The\\r\\naccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear\\r\\ncomparative analogy to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the\\r\\nseas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\\r\\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra\\r\\nincognita, so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to\\r\\ndiscover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the\\r\\nmost terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and\\r\\nindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who\\r\\nhave gone upon the waters; though but a moment\\'s consideration will\\r\\nteach, that however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and\\r\\nhowever much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may\\r\\naugment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea\\r\\nwill insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest\\r\\nfrigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of\\r\\nthese very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness\\r\\nof the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\\r\\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a\\r\\nwidow.  That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the\\r\\nwrecked ships of last year.  Yea, foolish mortals, Noah\\'s flood is\\r\\nnot yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\\r\\nmiracle upon the other?  Preternatural terrors rested upon the\\r\\nHebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground\\r\\nopened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever\\r\\nsets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships\\r\\nand crews.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but\\r\\nit is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host\\r\\nwho murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself\\r\\nhath spawned.  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle\\r\\noverlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales\\r\\nagainst the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split\\r\\nwrecks of ships.  No mercy, no power but its own controls it.\\r\\nPanting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider,\\r\\nthe masterless ocean overruns the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures\\r\\nglide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously\\r\\nhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.  Consider also the\\r\\ndevilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless\\r\\ntribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks.\\r\\nConsider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose\\r\\ncreatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the\\r\\nworld began.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most\\r\\ndocile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you\\r\\nnot find a strange analogy to something in yourself?  For as this\\r\\nappalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man\\r\\nthere lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed\\r\\nby all the horrors of the half known life.  God keep thee!  Push not\\r\\noff from that isle, thou canst never return!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\nSquid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on\\r\\nher way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air\\r\\nimpelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three\\r\\ntall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three\\r\\nmild palms on a plain.  And still, at wide intervals in the silvery\\r\\nnight, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost\\r\\npreternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any\\r\\nstagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed\\r\\na golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the\\r\\nslippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this\\r\\nprofound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by\\r\\nDaggoo from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher\\r\\nand higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed\\r\\nbefore our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.  Thus\\r\\nglistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.  Then once\\r\\nmore arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale; and yet is\\r\\nthis Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on\\r\\nre-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every\\r\\nman from his nod, the negro yelled out--\"There! there again! there\\r\\nshe breaches! right ahead!  The White Whale, the White Whale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time\\r\\nthe bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab\\r\\nstood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in\\r\\nreadiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance\\r\\nin the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm\\r\\nof Daggoo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\\r\\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect\\r\\nthe ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the\\r\\nparticular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his\\r\\neagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner\\r\\ndid he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick\\r\\nintensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab\\'s in advance, and all\\r\\nswiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down, and while,\\r\\nwith oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the\\r\\nsame spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.  Almost forgetting\\r\\nfor the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most\\r\\nwondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to\\r\\nmankind.  A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a\\r\\nglancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long\\r\\narms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest\\r\\nof anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within\\r\\nreach.  No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable\\r\\ntoken of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the\\r\\nbillows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck\\r\\nstill gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild\\r\\nvoice exclaimed--\"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,\\r\\nthan to have seen thee, thou white ghost!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was it, Sir?\" said Flask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,\\r\\nand returned to their ports to tell of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the\\r\\nvessel; the rest as silently following.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected\\r\\nwith the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it\\r\\nbeing so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it\\r\\nwith portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all\\r\\nof them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet\\r\\nvery few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its\\r\\ntrue nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to\\r\\nthe sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales\\r\\nfind their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of\\r\\nfeeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones\\r\\nbelow the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell\\r\\nof what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely\\r\\npursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms\\r\\nof the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty\\r\\nfeet in length.  They fancy that the monster to which these arms\\r\\nbelonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that\\r\\nthe sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in\\r\\norder to attack and tear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\\r\\nPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner in\\r\\nwhich the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,\\r\\nwith some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two\\r\\ncorrespond.  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the\\r\\nincredible bulk he assigns it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious\\r\\ncreature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of\\r\\ncuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would\\r\\nseem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well\\r\\nas for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere\\r\\npresented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible\\r\\nwhale-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,\\r\\nslightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of\\r\\nordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp\\r\\nmore pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more\\r\\nconvenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the\\r\\nordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close\\r\\ncoiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are\\r\\nbeginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope\\'s\\r\\ndurability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and\\r\\ngloss.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\\r\\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though\\r\\nnot so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and\\r\\nelastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),\\r\\nis much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a\\r\\ndusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a\\r\\ngolden-haired Circassian to behold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.  At first\\r\\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.  By\\r\\nexperiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one\\r\\nhundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain\\r\\nnearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common sperm whale-line\\r\\nmeasures something over two hundred fathoms.  Towards the stern of\\r\\nthe boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the\\r\\nworm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,\\r\\ncheese-shaped mass of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or layers of\\r\\nconcentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the \"heart,\" or\\r\\nminute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.  As the least\\r\\ntangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take\\r\\nsomebody\\'s arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is\\r\\nused in stowing the line in its tub.  Some harpooneers will consume\\r\\nalmost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high\\r\\naloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub,\\r\\nso as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and\\r\\ntwists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\\r\\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs.  There is some advantage in\\r\\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily\\r\\ninto the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American\\r\\ntub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes\\r\\na rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch\\r\\nin thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,\\r\\nwhich will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very\\r\\nmuch of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped\\r\\non the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off\\r\\nwith a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\\r\\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\\r\\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\\r\\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.\\r\\nFirst: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional\\r\\nline from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound\\r\\nso deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally\\r\\nattached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is\\r\\nshifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the\\r\\nother; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\\r\\nconsort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\\r\\nsafety\\'s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\\r\\nto the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\\r\\nalmost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\\r\\nstop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down\\r\\nafter him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no\\r\\ntown-crier would ever find her again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\\r\\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\\r\\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting\\r\\ncrosswise upon the loom or handle of every man\\'s oar, so that it jogs\\r\\nagainst his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as\\r\\nthey alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks\\r\\nor grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden\\r\\npin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping\\r\\nout.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and\\r\\nis then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms\\r\\n(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues\\r\\nits way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then\\r\\nattached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected\\r\\nwith the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes\\r\\nthrough sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\\r\\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the\\r\\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the\\r\\ntimid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the\\r\\ndeadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son\\r\\nof mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen\\r\\nintricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him\\r\\nthat at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these\\r\\nhorrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot\\r\\nbe thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in\\r\\nhis bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange\\r\\nthing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry\\r\\nmirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over\\r\\nyour mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of\\r\\nthe whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman\\'s nooses; and, like the six\\r\\nburghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew\\r\\npull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you\\r\\nmay say.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for\\r\\nthose repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually\\r\\nchronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by\\r\\nthe line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out, to be seated\\r\\nthen in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold\\r\\nwhizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and\\r\\nshaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit\\r\\nmotionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking\\r\\nlike a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the\\r\\nslightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\\r\\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\\r\\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\\r\\nnever pierce you out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\\r\\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\\r\\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;\\r\\nand contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the\\r\\nfatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose\\r\\nof the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before\\r\\nbeing brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of\\r\\ntrue terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why\\r\\nsay more?  All men live enveloped in whale-lines.  All are born with\\r\\nhalters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,\\r\\nsudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle,\\r\\never-present perils of life.  And if you be a philosopher, though\\r\\nseated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more\\r\\nof terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,\\r\\nand not a harpoon, by your side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb Kills a Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,\\r\\nto Queequeg it was quite a different object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you see him \\'quid,\" said the savage, honing his harpoon in the\\r\\nbow of his hoisted boat, \"then you quick see him \\'parm whale.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing\\r\\nspecial to engage them, the Pequod\\'s crew could hardly resist the\\r\\nspell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.  For this part of the\\r\\nIndian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen\\r\\ncall a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of\\r\\nporpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of\\r\\nmore stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the\\r\\nin-shore ground off Peru.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\\r\\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\\r\\nin what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;\\r\\nin that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went\\r\\nout of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum\\r\\nwill, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\\r\\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So\\r\\nthat at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for\\r\\nevery swing that we made there was a nod from below from the\\r\\nslumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;\\r\\nand across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the\\r\\nsun over all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices\\r\\nmy hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency\\r\\npreserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under\\r\\nour lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in\\r\\nthe water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy\\r\\nback, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun\\'s rays like a\\r\\nmirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and\\r\\nanon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a\\r\\nportly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,\\r\\npoor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter\\'s wand, the\\r\\nsleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into\\r\\nwakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the\\r\\nvessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth\\r\\nthe accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted\\r\\nthe sparkling brine into the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clear away the boats!  Luff!\" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own\\r\\norder, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the\\r\\nspokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\\r\\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\\r\\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few\\r\\nripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be\\r\\nalarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man\\r\\nmust speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the\\r\\ngunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the\\r\\ncalm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as\\r\\nwe thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail\\r\\nforty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower\\r\\nswallowed up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There go flukes!\" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed\\r\\nby Stubb\\'s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a\\r\\nrespite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had\\r\\nelapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the\\r\\nsmoker\\'s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb\\r\\ncounted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the\\r\\nwhale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of\\r\\ncautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,\\r\\nand oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb\\r\\ncheered on his crew to the assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his\\r\\njeopardy, he was going \"head out\"; that part obliquely projecting\\r\\nfrom the mad yeast which he brewed.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance\\r\\nthe entire interior of the sperm whale\\'s enormous head consists.\\r\\nThough apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant\\r\\npart about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and\\r\\ninvariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is\\r\\nthe breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the\\r\\ntapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\\r\\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from\\r\\na bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York\\r\\npilot-boat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Start her, start her, my men!  Don\\'t hurry yourselves; take plenty\\r\\nof time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\\'s all,\"\\r\\ncried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  \"Start her, now;\\r\\ngive \\'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my\\r\\nboy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the\\r\\nword--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,\\r\\nand raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\\r\\nboys--that\\'s all.  Start her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!\" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some\\r\\nold war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\\r\\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\\r\\nwhich the eager Indian gave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.\\r\\n\"Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!\" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards\\r\\non his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ka-la!  Koo-loo!\" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\\r\\nmouthful of Grenadier\\'s steak.  And thus with oars and yells the\\r\\nkeels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the\\r\\nvan, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the\\r\\nsmoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they\\r\\nstrained, till the welcome cry was heard--\"Stand up, Tashtego!--give\\r\\nit to him!\"  The harpoon was hurled.  \"Stern all!\"  The oarsmen\\r\\nbacked water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along\\r\\nevery one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant\\r\\nbefore, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round\\r\\nthe loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a\\r\\nhempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes\\r\\nfrom his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so\\r\\nalso, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through\\r\\nand through both of Stubb\\'s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or\\r\\nsquares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had\\r\\naccidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy\\'s sharp two-edged\\r\\nsword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it\\r\\nout of your clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wet the line! wet the line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\\r\\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\\r\\nit.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\\r\\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\\r\\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering\\r\\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\\r\\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\\r\\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\\r\\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the\\r\\nmost convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\\r\\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\\r\\nwould have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,\\r\\nthe other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing\\r\\nelements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a\\r\\nceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion\\r\\nfrom within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking\\r\\ncraft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they\\r\\nrushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent\\r\\nbeing tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the\\r\\nsteering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his\\r\\ncentre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as\\r\\nthey shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened\\r\\nhis flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haul in--haul in!\" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\\r\\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\\r\\nyet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,\\r\\nStubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart\\r\\nafter dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat\\r\\nalternately sterning out of the way of the whale\\'s horrible wallow,\\r\\nand then ranging up for another fling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks\\r\\ndown a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,\\r\\nwhich bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The\\r\\nslanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back\\r\\nits reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other\\r\\nlike red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was\\r\\nagonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\\r\\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,\\r\\nhauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb\\r\\nstraightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the\\r\\ngunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pull up--pull up!\" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\\r\\nrelaxed in his wrath.  \"Pull up!--close to!\" and the boat ranged\\r\\nalong the fish\\'s flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly\\r\\nchurned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,\\r\\ncarefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel\\r\\nafter some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which\\r\\nhe was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold\\r\\nwatch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is\\r\\nstruck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing\\r\\ncalled his \"flurry,\" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,\\r\\noverwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the\\r\\nimperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to\\r\\nstruggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\\r\\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and\\r\\ncontracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized\\r\\nrespirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it\\r\\nhad been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and\\r\\nfalling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into\\r\\nthe sea.  His heart had burst!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s dead, Mr. Stubb,\" said Daggoo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; both pipes smoked out!\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\\r\\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,\\r\\nstood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 62\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat\\r\\npushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as\\r\\ntemporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the\\r\\nforemost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a\\r\\nstrong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for\\r\\noften, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be\\r\\nflung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however\\r\\nprolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to\\r\\npull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to\\r\\nset an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by\\r\\nincredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\\r\\nand what it is to keep shouting at the top of one\\'s compass, while\\r\\nall the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is\\r\\nnone know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very\\r\\nheartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this\\r\\nstraining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at\\r\\nonce the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--\"Stand up, and\\r\\ngive it to him!\"  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round\\r\\non his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with\\r\\nwhat little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into\\r\\nthe whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,\\r\\nthat out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;\\r\\nno wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and\\r\\ndisrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\\r\\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\\r\\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\\r\\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\\r\\nthat makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how\\r\\ncan you expect to find it there when most wanted!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical\\r\\ninstant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and\\r\\nharpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent\\r\\njeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change\\r\\nplaces; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,\\r\\ntakes his proper station in the bows of the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\\r\\nfoolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from\\r\\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\\r\\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\\r\\nobvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a\\r\\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\\r\\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\\r\\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\\r\\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\\r\\nharpooneer that has caused them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of\\r\\nthis world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not\\r\\nfrom out of toil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 63\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crotch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in\\r\\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent\\r\\nmention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in\\r\\nlength, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale\\r\\nnear the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden\\r\\nextremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly\\r\\nprojects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to\\r\\nits hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a\\r\\nbackwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have\\r\\ntwo harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first\\r\\nand second irons.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\\r\\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\\r\\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\\r\\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.\\r\\nIt is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that\\r\\nowing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale\\r\\nupon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\\r\\nharpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the\\r\\nsecond iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already\\r\\nconnected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon\\r\\nmust, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,\\r\\nsomehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve\\r\\nall hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;\\r\\nthe spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making\\r\\nthis feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this\\r\\ncritical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\\r\\ncasualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\\r\\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\\r\\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the\\r\\nlines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all\\r\\ndirections.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until\\r\\nthe whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\\r\\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\\r\\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\\r\\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\\r\\nsimultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is\\r\\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the\\r\\nfirst one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these\\r\\nparticulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\\r\\nelucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in\\r\\nscenes hereafter to be painted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 64\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb\\'s Supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb\\'s whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a\\r\\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\\r\\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen\\r\\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\\r\\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\\r\\ncorpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\\r\\nlong intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\\r\\nenormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of\\r\\nHang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on\\r\\nthe foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile\\r\\nan hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if\\r\\nladen with pig-lead in bulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\\r\\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly\\r\\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\\r\\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\\r\\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\\r\\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\\r\\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\\r\\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\\r\\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a\\r\\nthousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not\\r\\none jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would\\r\\nhave thought from the sound on the Pequod\\'s decks, that all hands\\r\\nwere preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being\\r\\ndragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.\\r\\nBut by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is\\r\\nto be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the\\r\\nbows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel\\'s\\r\\nand seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars\\r\\nand rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together\\r\\nlike colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains\\r\\nstanding.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most\\r\\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored\\r\\nalongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density\\r\\nthat part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\\r\\nside-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low\\r\\nbeneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from\\r\\nthe boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is\\r\\ningeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden\\r\\nfloat at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other\\r\\nend is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\\r\\nmade to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\\r\\ngirdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and\\r\\nbeing slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\\r\\nsmallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\\r\\nflukes or lobes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be\\r\\nknown on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,\\r\\nbetrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an\\r\\nunwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official\\r\\nsuperior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of\\r\\naffairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,\\r\\nwas soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was\\r\\nsomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his\\r\\npalate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and\\r\\ncut me one from his small!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a\\r\\ngeneral thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the\\r\\nenemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before\\r\\nrealizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some\\r\\nof these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular\\r\\npart of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering\\r\\nextremity of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\\r\\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti\\r\\nsupper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor\\r\\nwas Stubb the only banqueter on whale\\'s flesh that night.  Mingling\\r\\ntheir mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of\\r\\nsharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its\\r\\nfatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled\\r\\nby the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few\\r\\ninches of the sleepers\\' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just\\r\\nsee them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black\\r\\nwaters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge\\r\\nglobular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This\\r\\nparticular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such\\r\\nan apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\\r\\nsymmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\\r\\nthings.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened\\r\\nto the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,\\r\\nsharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship\\'s decks, like\\r\\nhungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to\\r\\nbolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while\\r\\nthe valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving\\r\\neach other\\'s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,\\r\\nthe sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely\\r\\ncarving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you\\r\\nto turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much\\r\\nthe same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough\\r\\nfor all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders\\r\\nof all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting\\r\\nalongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or\\r\\na dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like\\r\\ninstances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and\\r\\noccasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\\r\\nhilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when\\r\\nyou will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more\\r\\njovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a\\r\\nwhaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend\\r\\nyour decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the\\r\\nexpediency of conciliating the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\\r\\ngoing on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of\\r\\nhis own epicurean lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook, cook!--where\\'s that old Fleece?\" he cried at length, widening\\r\\nhis legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his\\r\\nsupper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\\r\\nstabbing with his lance; \"cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\\r\\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came\\r\\nshambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was\\r\\nsomething the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\\r\\nscoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,\\r\\ncame shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,\\r\\nwhich, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;\\r\\nthis old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of\\r\\ncommand, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb\\'s\\r\\nsideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on\\r\\nhis two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at\\r\\nthe same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best\\r\\near into play.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook,\" said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\\r\\nmouth, \"don\\'t you think this steak is rather overdone?  You\\'ve been\\r\\nbeating this steak too much, cook; it\\'s too tender.  Don\\'t I always\\r\\nsay that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those\\r\\nsharks now over the side, don\\'t you see they prefer it tough and\\r\\nrare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to \\'em;\\r\\ntell \\'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in\\r\\nmoderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own\\r\\nvoice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this\\r\\nlantern,\" snatching one from his sideboard; \"now then, go and preach\\r\\nto \\'em!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the\\r\\ndeck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low\\r\\nover the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the\\r\\nother hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the\\r\\nside in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,\\r\\nsoftly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fellow-critters: I\\'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam\\r\\nnoise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin\\' ob de lips!  Massa\\r\\nStubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but\\r\\nby Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook,\" here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden\\r\\nslap on the shoulder,--\"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn\\'t swear\\r\\nthat way when you\\'re preaching.  That\\'s no way to convert sinners,\\r\\ncook!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself,\" sullenly turning to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, cook; go on, go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:\"-\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right!\" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, \"coax \\'em to it; try that,\"\\r\\nand Fleece continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\\r\\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--\\'top dat dam slappin\\' ob de\\r\\ntail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin\\'\\r\\nand bitin\\' dare?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook,\" cried Stubb, collaring him, \"I won\\'t have that swearing.\\r\\nTalk to \\'em gentlemanly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don\\'t blame ye so much for;\\r\\ndat is natur, and can\\'t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,\\r\\ndat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in\\r\\nyou, why den you be angel; for all angel is not\\'ing more dan de shark\\r\\nwell goberned.  Now, look here, bred\\'ren, just try wonst to be cibil,\\r\\na helping yourselbs from dat whale.  Don\\'t be tearin\\' de blubber out\\r\\nyour neighbour\\'s mout, I say.

Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;\\r\\nfill your dam bellies \\'till dey bust--and den die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, cook,\" said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; \"stand\\r\\njust where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay\\r\\nparticular attention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All \\'dention,\" said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in\\r\\nthe desired position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; \"I shall now go\\r\\nback to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are\\r\\nyou, cook?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What dat do wid de \\'teak,\" said the old black, testily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Silence!  How old are you, cook?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Bout ninety, dey say,\" he gloomily muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,\\r\\nand don\\'t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?\" rapidly bolting\\r\\nanother mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a\\r\\ncontinuation of the question.  \"Where were you born, cook?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin\\' ober de Roanoke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Born in a ferry-boat!  That\\'s queer, too.  But I want to know what\\r\\ncountry you were born in, cook!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t I say de Roanoke country?\" he cried sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you didn\\'t, cook; but I\\'ll tell you what I\\'m coming to, cook.\\r\\nYou must go home and be born over again; you don\\'t know how to cook a\\r\\nwhale-steak yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,\" he growled, angrily, turning\\r\\nround to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit\\r\\nof steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it\\r\\nshould be?  Take it, I say\"--holding the tongs towards him--\"take it,\\r\\nand taste it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old\\r\\nnegro muttered, \"Best cooked \\'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook,\" said Stubb, squaring himself once more; \"do you belong to the\\r\\nchurch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Passed one once in Cape-Down,\" said the old man sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\\r\\nwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\\r\\nhis beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,\\r\\nand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?\" said Stubb.\\r\\n\"Where do you expect to go to, cook?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to bed berry soon,\" he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It\\'s an awful\\r\\nquestion.  Now what\\'s your answer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When dis old brack man dies,\" said the negro slowly, changing his\\r\\nwhole air and demeanor, \"he hisself won\\'t go nowhere; but some\\r\\nbressed angel will come and fetch him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And\\r\\nfetch him where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up dere,\" said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and\\r\\nkeeping it there very solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\\r\\nyou are dead?  But don\\'t you know the higher you climb, the colder it\\r\\ngets?  Main-top, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t say dat t\\'all,\" said Fleece, again in the sulks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said up there, didn\\'t you? and now look yourself, and see where\\r\\nyour tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven\\r\\nby crawling through the lubber\\'s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you\\r\\ndon\\'t get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.\\r\\nIt\\'s a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it\\'s no go.  But\\r\\nnone of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my\\r\\norders.  Do ye hear?  Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t\\'other\\r\\na\\'top of your heart, when I\\'m giving my orders, cook.  What! that\\r\\nyour heart, there?--that\\'s your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that\\'s\\r\\nit--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All \\'dention,\" said the old black, with both hands placed as\\r\\ndesired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears\\r\\nin front at one and the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\\r\\nthat I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\\r\\ndon\\'t you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak\\r\\nfor my private table here, the capstan, I\\'ll tell you what to do so\\r\\nas not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand, and\\r\\nshow a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d\\'ye hear?\\r\\nAnd now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure\\r\\nyou stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.\\r\\nAs for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now ye\\r\\nmay go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\\r\\nD\\'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you\\r\\ngo.--Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don\\'t forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, \\'stead of him eat whale.  I\\'m bressed\\r\\nif he ain\\'t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\" muttered the old\\r\\nman, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his\\r\\nhammock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 65\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale as a Dish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp,\\r\\nand, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems\\r\\nso outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the\\r\\nhistory and philosophy of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\\r\\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\\r\\nprices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth\\'s time, a certain cook of\\r\\nthe court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce\\r\\nto be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a\\r\\nspecies of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine\\r\\neating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\\r\\nballs, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for\\r\\nturtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very\\r\\nfond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\\r\\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\\r\\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\\r\\nlong, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men\\r\\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\\r\\nnot so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have\\r\\nrare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their\\r\\nmost famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\\r\\nbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that\\r\\ncertain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland\\r\\nby a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months\\r\\non the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after\\r\\ntrying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are\\r\\ncalled \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\\r\\nand crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives\\'\\r\\ndough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look\\r\\nthat the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\\r\\nexceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to\\r\\nbe delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating\\r\\nas the buffalo\\'s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a\\r\\nsolid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and\\r\\ncreamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a\\r\\ncocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply\\r\\na substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method\\r\\nof absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.\\r\\nIn the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the\\r\\nseamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them\\r\\nfry there awhile.  Many a good supper have I thus made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\\r\\ndish.  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the\\r\\ntwo plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two\\r\\nlarge puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a\\r\\nmost delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves\\' head,\\r\\nwhich is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that\\r\\nsome young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon\\r\\ncalves\\' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,\\r\\nso as to be able to tell a calf\\'s head from their own heads; which,\\r\\nindeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why\\r\\na young buck with an intelligent looking calf\\'s head before him, is\\r\\nsomehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort\\r\\nof reproachfully at him, with an \"Et tu Brute!\" expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\\r\\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\\r\\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the\\r\\nconsideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly\\r\\nmurdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no\\r\\ndoubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a\\r\\nmurderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by\\r\\noxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if\\r\\nany murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see\\r\\nthe crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead\\r\\nquadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal\\'s\\r\\njaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more\\r\\ntolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his\\r\\ncellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that\\r\\nprovident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,\\r\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground\\r\\nand feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\\r\\nadding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my\\r\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what\\r\\nis that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the\\r\\nvery ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after\\r\\ndevouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with\\r\\nwhat quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of\\r\\nCruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within\\r\\nthe last month or two that that society passed a resolution to\\r\\npatronise nothing but steel pens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 66\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shark Massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\\r\\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a\\r\\ngeneral thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business\\r\\nof cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious\\r\\none; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about\\r\\nit.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the\\r\\nhelm a\\'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till\\r\\ndaylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches\\r\\nshall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the\\r\\ncrew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan\\r\\nwill not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks\\r\\ngather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,\\r\\nsay, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by\\r\\nmorning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish\\r\\ndo not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times\\r\\nconsiderably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp\\r\\nwhaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some\\r\\ninstances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.\\r\\nBut it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod\\'s sharks;\\r\\nthough, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have\\r\\nlooked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole\\r\\nround sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper\\r\\nwas concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle\\r\\nseaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the\\r\\nsharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,\\r\\nand lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light\\r\\nover the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long\\r\\nwhaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by\\r\\nstriking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only\\r\\nvital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling\\r\\nhosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought\\r\\nabout new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They\\r\\nviciously snapped, not only at each other\\'s disembowelments, but like\\r\\nflexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails\\r\\nseemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be\\r\\noppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was\\r\\nunsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A\\r\\nsort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very\\r\\njoints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had\\r\\ndeparted.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one\\r\\nof these sharks almost took poor Queequeg\\'s hand off, when he tried\\r\\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best\\r\\nsteel; is about the bigness of a man\\'s spread hand; and in general\\r\\nshape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;\\r\\nonly its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably\\r\\nnarrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as\\r\\npossible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a\\r\\nrazor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,\\r\\nis inserted for a handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg no care what god made him shark,\" said the savage,\\r\\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \"wedder Fejee god or\\r\\nNantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 67\\r\\n\\r\\nCutting In.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio\\r\\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod\\r\\nwas turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You\\r\\nwould have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the\\r\\nsea gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other\\r\\nponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted\\r\\ngreen, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of\\r\\ngrapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower\\r\\nmast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship\\'s deck.  The end\\r\\nof the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then\\r\\nconducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles\\r\\nwas swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,\\r\\nweighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in\\r\\nstages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their\\r\\nlong spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of\\r\\nthe hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a\\r\\nbroad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,\\r\\nand the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence\\r\\nheaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the\\r\\nentire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like\\r\\nthe nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,\\r\\nquivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more\\r\\nshe leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the\\r\\nwindlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at\\r\\nlast, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship\\r\\nrolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle\\r\\nrises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of\\r\\nthe first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale\\r\\nprecisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the\\r\\nbody precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.\\r\\nFor the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps\\r\\nthe whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in\\r\\none strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \"scarf,\"\\r\\nsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;\\r\\nand just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very\\r\\nact itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft\\r\\ntill its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then\\r\\ncease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping\\r\\nmass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one\\r\\npresent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may\\r\\nbox his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen\\r\\nweapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he\\r\\ndexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the\\r\\nswaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating\\r\\ngreat tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,\\r\\nin order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished\\r\\nswordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\\r\\nscientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,\\r\\nlunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the\\r\\nshort lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a\\r\\nblanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The\\r\\nheavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is\\r\\npeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is\\r\\nslowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\\r\\nhatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\\r\\nblubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\\r\\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass\\r\\nof plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles\\r\\nhoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass\\r\\nheaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the\\r\\nmates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing\\r\\noccasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 68\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\\r\\nof the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced\\r\\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion\\r\\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already\\r\\nyou know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the\\r\\nconsistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic\\r\\nand compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen\\r\\ninches in thickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\\r\\ncreature\\'s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,\\r\\nyet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a\\r\\npresumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping\\r\\nlayer from the whale\\'s body but that same blubber; and the outermost\\r\\nenveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be\\r\\nbut the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you\\r\\nmay scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent\\r\\nsubstance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only\\r\\nit is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to\\r\\nbeing dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes\\r\\nrather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use\\r\\nfor marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;\\r\\nand being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself\\r\\nwith fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is\\r\\npleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you\\r\\nmay say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same\\r\\ninfinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the\\r\\nentire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin\\r\\nof the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were\\r\\nsimply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous\\r\\nwhale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.\\r\\nBut no more of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this\\r\\nskin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk\\r\\nof one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in\\r\\nquantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only\\r\\nthree fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea\\r\\nmay hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere\\r\\npart of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.\\r\\nReckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net\\r\\nweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale\\'s skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least\\r\\namong the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over\\r\\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\\r\\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\\r\\nengravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\\r\\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,\\r\\nas if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In\\r\\nsome instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as\\r\\nin a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other\\r\\ndelineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those\\r\\nmysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that\\r\\nis the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive\\r\\nmemory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was\\r\\nmuch struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters\\r\\nchiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the\\r\\nUpper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked\\r\\nwhale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks\\r\\nreminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which\\r\\nthe exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the\\r\\nback, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the\\r\\nregular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,\\r\\naltogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those\\r\\nNew England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear\\r\\nthe marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I\\r\\nshould say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm\\r\\nWhale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in\\r\\nthe whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for\\r\\nI have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the\\r\\nspecies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of\\r\\nthe whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in\\r\\nlong pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is\\r\\nvery happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his\\r\\nblubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an\\r\\nIndian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is\\r\\nby reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is\\r\\nenabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,\\r\\ntimes, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in\\r\\nthose shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy\\r\\nsurtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those\\r\\nHyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,\\r\\nlungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that\\r\\nwarm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter\\r\\nwould bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs\\r\\nand warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it\\r\\nthen--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom\\r\\ncorporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful\\r\\nthat he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in\\r\\nthose Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are\\r\\nsometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the\\r\\nhearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more\\r\\nsurprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the\\r\\nblood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\r\\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\\r\\nvirtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself\\r\\nafter the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,\\r\\nlive in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep\\r\\nthy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter\\'s, and\\r\\nlike the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\\r\\nthine own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of\\r\\nerections, how few are domed like St. Peter\\'s! of creatures, how few\\r\\nvast as the whale!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 69\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of\\r\\nthe beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in\\r\\nhue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still\\r\\ncolossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it\\r\\ntorn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed\\r\\nwith rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so\\r\\nmany insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless\\r\\nphantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that\\r\\nit so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of\\r\\nfowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the\\r\\nalmost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the\\r\\nunclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,\\r\\nwafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and\\r\\non, till lost in infinite perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures\\r\\nall in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or\\r\\nspeckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I\\r\\nween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his\\r\\nfuneral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of\\r\\nearth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\\r\\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid\\r\\nman-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the\\r\\ndistance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the\\r\\nwhite mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high\\r\\nagainst it; straightway the whale\\'s unharming corpse, with trembling\\r\\nfingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS\\r\\nHEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun\\r\\nthe place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because\\r\\ntheir leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.  There\\'s\\r\\nyour law of precedents; there\\'s your utility of traditions; there\\'s\\r\\nthe story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on\\r\\nthe earth, and now not even hovering in the air!  There\\'s orthodoxy!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, while in life the great whale\\'s body may have been a real\\r\\nterror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic\\r\\nto a world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts than\\r\\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\\r\\nin them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 70\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sphynx.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\\r\\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.  Now, the beheading of\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which\\r\\nexperienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not\\r\\nwithout reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a\\r\\nneck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,\\r\\nin that very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also,\\r\\nthat the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet\\r\\nintervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost\\r\\nhidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\\r\\nbursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward\\r\\ncircumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that\\r\\nsubterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into\\r\\nthe ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear\\r\\nof all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a\\r\\ncritical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not\\r\\nmarvel, then, at Stubb\\'s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\\r\\nbehead a sperm whale?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\\r\\ncable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small\\r\\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,\\r\\nwith a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale\\'s\\r\\nhead embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to\\r\\nsuspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a\\r\\nwhaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn\\r\\nin jewellers\\' scales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\\r\\nwas hoisted against the ship\\'s side--about half way out of the sea,\\r\\nso that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native\\r\\nelement.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,\\r\\nby reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and\\r\\nevery yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;\\r\\nthere, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod\\'s waist like the\\r\\ngiant Holofernes\\'s from the girdle of Judith.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\\r\\nbelow to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous\\r\\nbut now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal\\r\\nyellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless\\r\\nleaves upon the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\\r\\nfrom his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\\r\\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\\r\\nStubb\\'s long spade--still remaining there after the whale\\'s\\r\\nDecapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the\\r\\nhalf-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,\\r\\nand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\\r\\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx\\'s in the desert.  \"Speak, thou\\r\\nvast and venerable head,\" muttered Ahab, \"which, though ungarnished\\r\\nwith a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,\\r\\nmighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all\\r\\ndivers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper\\r\\nsun now gleams, has moved amid this world\\'s foundations.  Where\\r\\nunrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;\\r\\nwhere in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with\\r\\nbones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,\\r\\nthere was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver\\r\\nnever went; hast slept by many a sailor\\'s side, where sleepless\\r\\nmothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw\\'st the\\r\\nlocked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart\\r\\nthey sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven\\r\\nseemed false to them.  Thou saw\\'st the murdered mate when tossed by\\r\\npirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper\\r\\nmidnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on\\r\\nunharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that\\r\\nwould have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.\\r\\nO head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an\\r\\ninfidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sail ho!\" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye?  Well, now, that\\'s cheering,\" cried Ahab, suddenly erecting\\r\\nhimself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  \"That\\r\\nlively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\\r\\nman.--Where away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze\\r\\nto us!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that\\r\\nway, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!  O Nature, and O soul\\r\\nof man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not\\r\\nthe smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning\\r\\nduplicate in mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 71\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jeroboam\\'s Story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster\\r\\nthan the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger\\'s boats and manned\\r\\nmast-heads proved her a whale-ship.  But as she was so far to\\r\\nwindward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other\\r\\nground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was\\r\\nset to see what response would be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\\r\\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\\r\\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\\r\\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the\\r\\nwhale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,\\r\\neven at considerable distances and with no small facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\\'s\\r\\nsetting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of\\r\\nNantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the\\r\\nPequod\\'s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the\\r\\nside-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\\'s order to accommodate the\\r\\nvisiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his\\r\\nboat\\'s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.\\r\\nIt turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,\\r\\nand that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\\'s\\r\\ncompany.  For, though himself and boat\\'s crew remained untainted, and\\r\\nthough his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea\\r\\nand air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to\\r\\nthe timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come\\r\\ninto direct contact with the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an\\r\\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the\\r\\nJeroboam\\'s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep\\r\\nparallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by\\r\\nthis time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,\\r\\nindeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the\\r\\nboat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully\\r\\nbrought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the\\r\\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between\\r\\nthe two parties; but at intervals not without still another\\r\\ninterruption of a very different sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam\\'s boat, was a man of a singular\\r\\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\\r\\nnotabilities make up all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish\\r\\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\\r\\nyellow hair.  A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded\\r\\nwalnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were\\r\\nrolled up on his wrists.  A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\\r\\nexclaimed--\"That\\'s he! that\\'s he!--the long-togged scaramouch the\\r\\nTown-Ho\\'s company told us of!\"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story\\r\\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\\r\\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to this\\r\\naccount and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the\\r\\nscaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost\\r\\neverybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\\r\\nShakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\\r\\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\\r\\ntrap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which\\r\\nhe carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing\\r\\ngunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.  A strange,\\r\\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for\\r\\nNantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed\\r\\na steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand\\r\\ncandidate for the Jeroboam\\'s whaling voyage.  They engaged him; but\\r\\nstraightway upon the ship\\'s getting out of sight of land, his\\r\\ninsanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the\\r\\narchangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He\\r\\npublished his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the\\r\\ndeliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.\\r\\nThe unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the\\r\\ndark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the\\r\\npreternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel\\r\\nin the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere\\r\\nof sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.  As such a man,\\r\\nhowever, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he\\r\\nrefused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would\\r\\nfain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual\\'s\\r\\nintention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel\\r\\nforthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all\\r\\nhands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried\\r\\nout.  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that\\r\\nat last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel\\r\\nwas sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.  He was\\r\\ntherefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they permit\\r\\nGabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it\\r\\ncame to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The\\r\\nconsequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or\\r\\nnothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken\\r\\nout, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,\\r\\nas he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but\\r\\naccording to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,\\r\\ncringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his\\r\\ninstructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\\r\\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are\\r\\ntrue.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\\r\\nthe measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his\\r\\nmeasureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But\\r\\nit is time to return to the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fear not thy epidemic, man,\" said Ahab from the bulwarks, to\\r\\nCaptain Mayhew, who stood in the boat\\'s stern; \"come on board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!  Beware of the\\r\\nhorrible plague!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gabriel!  Gabriel!\" cried Captain Mayhew; \"thou must either--\"  But\\r\\nthat instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its\\r\\nseethings drowned all speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast thou seen the White Whale?\" demanded Ahab, when the boat\\r\\ndrifted back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!  Beware of the\\r\\nhorrible tail!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--\"  But again the boat tore ahead\\r\\nas if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a\\r\\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those\\r\\noccasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.\\r\\nMeantime, the hoisted sperm whale\\'s head jogged about very violently,\\r\\nand Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than\\r\\nhis archangel nature seemed to warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\\r\\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions\\r\\nfrom Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that\\r\\nseemed leagued with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon\\r\\nspeaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\\r\\nexistence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking\\r\\nin this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\\r\\nattacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his\\r\\ngibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being\\r\\nthan the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But\\r\\nwhen, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\\r\\nthe mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter\\r\\nhim; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\\r\\nopportunity, despite all the archangel\\'s denunciations and\\r\\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\\r\\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\\r\\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\\r\\niron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\\r\\nwas tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies\\r\\nof speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,\\r\\nwhile Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat\\'s bow, and with\\r\\nall the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild\\r\\nexclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for\\r\\nhis poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\\r\\nquick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\\r\\nbodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\\r\\nfurious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\\r\\nin his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\\r\\nyards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any\\r\\noarsman\\'s head; but the mate for ever sank.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\\r\\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\\r\\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\\r\\noftener the boat\\'s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\\r\\nthe headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.\\r\\nBut strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances\\r\\nthan one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of\\r\\nviolence is discernible; the man being stark dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\\r\\ndescried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--\"The vial! the\\r\\nvial!\"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further\\r\\nhunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with\\r\\nadded influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\\r\\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\\r\\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit\\r\\none of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless\\r\\nterror to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to\\r\\nhim, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\\r\\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To\\r\\nwhich Ahab answered--\"Aye.\"  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more\\r\\nstarted to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently\\r\\nexclaimed, with downward pointed finger--\"Think, think of the\\r\\nblasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer\\'s end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \"Captain, I have\\r\\njust bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\\r\\nofficers, if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\\r\\nships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,\\r\\ndepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.\\r\\nThus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only\\r\\nreceived after attaining an age of two or three years or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely\\r\\ntumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\\r\\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a\\r\\nletter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'st not read it?\" cried Ahab.  \"Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it\\'s\\r\\nbut a dim scrawl;--what\\'s this?\"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck\\r\\ntook a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the\\r\\nend, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the\\r\\nboat, without its coming any closer to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har--yes, Mr.\\r\\nHarry--(a woman\\'s pinny hand,--the man\\'s wife, I\\'ll wager)--Aye--Mr.\\r\\nHarry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it\\'s Macey, and he\\'s dead!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,\" sighed Mayhew; \"but\\r\\nlet me have it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, keep it thyself,\" cried Gabriel to Ahab; \"thou art soon going\\r\\nthat way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Curses throttle thee!\" yelled Ahab.  \"Captain Mayhew, stand by now\\r\\nto receive it\"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck\\'s hands,\\r\\nhe caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\\r\\nboat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from\\r\\nrowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship\\'s stern; so that,\\r\\nas if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel\\'s eager\\r\\nhand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and\\r\\nimpaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.\\r\\nIt fell at Ahab\\'s feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to\\r\\ngive way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat\\r\\nrapidly shot away from the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the\\r\\njacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to\\r\\nthis wild affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 72\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monkey-Rope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\\r\\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now\\r\\nhands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There\\r\\nis no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time\\r\\neverything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him\\r\\nwho endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our\\r\\nway a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\\r\\nthe whale\\'s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original\\r\\nhole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and\\r\\nweighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was\\r\\ninserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,\\r\\nas harpooneer, to descend upon the monster\\'s back for the special\\r\\npurpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require\\r\\nthat the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing\\r\\nor stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies\\r\\nalmost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\\r\\nupon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\\r\\npoor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\\r\\nwater, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On\\r\\nthe occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a\\r\\nshirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to\\r\\nuncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as\\r\\nwill presently be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the savage\\'s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\\r\\nbow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful\\r\\nduty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon\\r\\nthe dead whale\\'s back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a\\r\\ndancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship\\'s steep side, did\\r\\nI hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called\\r\\nin the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas\\r\\nbelted round his waist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we\\r\\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at\\r\\nboth ends; fast to Queequeg\\'s broad canvas belt, and fast to my\\r\\nnarrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the\\r\\ntime, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,\\r\\nthen both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,\\r\\nit should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese\\r\\nligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;\\r\\nnor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the\\r\\nhempen bond entailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\\r\\nthat while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\\r\\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\\r\\ncompany of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and\\r\\nthat another\\'s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into\\r\\nunmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort\\r\\nof interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could\\r\\nhave so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I\\r\\njerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would\\r\\nthreaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this\\r\\nsituation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that\\r\\nbreathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese\\r\\nconnexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,\\r\\nyou snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your\\r\\npills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you\\r\\nmay possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of\\r\\nlife.  But handle Queequeg\\'s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\\r\\nsometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.\\r\\nNor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the\\r\\nmanagement of one end of it.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the\\r\\nPequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.  This\\r\\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\\r\\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\\r\\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\\r\\nmonkey-rope holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\\r\\nwhale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the\\r\\nincessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only\\r\\njamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made\\r\\nupon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly\\r\\nallured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the\\r\\ncarcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\\r\\naside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether incredible were\\r\\nit not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\\r\\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\\r\\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\\r\\nthem.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and\\r\\nthen jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of\\r\\nwhat seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still\\r\\nanother protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\\r\\nTashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\\r\\nkeen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they\\r\\ncould reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\\r\\ndisinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg\\'s best\\r\\nhappiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\\r\\nthe circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\\r\\nhidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\\r\\nwould come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I\\r\\nsuppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor\\r\\nQueequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life\\r\\ninto the hands of his gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\\r\\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters\\r\\nit, after all?  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us\\r\\nmen in this whaling world?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is\\r\\nLife; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what\\r\\nbetween sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor\\r\\nlad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For\\r\\nnow, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at\\r\\nlast climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\\r\\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\\r\\nconsolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,\\r\\nye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?\" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\\r\\n\"Yes, this must be ginger,\" peering into the as yet untasted cup.\\r\\nThen standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards\\r\\nthe astonished steward slowly saying, \"Ginger? ginger? and will you\\r\\nhave the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\\r\\nginger?  Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\\r\\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is\\r\\nginger?--sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer\\r\\nmatches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil is ginger, I say, that\\r\\nyou offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\\r\\nbusiness,\" he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\\r\\ncome from forward.  \"Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of\\r\\nit, if you please.\"  Then watching the mate\\'s countenance, he added,\\r\\n\"The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and\\r\\njalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward\\r\\nan apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters\\r\\nby which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I trust not,\" said Starbuck, \"it is poor stuff enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, steward,\" cried Stubb, \"we\\'ll teach you to drug it\\r\\nharpooneer; none of your apothecary\\'s medicine here; you want to\\r\\npoison us, do ye?  You have got out insurances on our lives and want\\r\\nto murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not me,\" cried Dough-Boy, \"it was Aunt Charity that brought\\r\\nthe ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any\\r\\nspirits, but only this ginger-jub--so she called it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to\\r\\nthe lockers, and get something better.  I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck.  It is the captain\\'s orders--grog for the harpooneer on a\\r\\nwhale.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough,\" replied Starbuck, \"only don\\'t hit him again, but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something\\r\\nof that sort; and this fellow\\'s a weazel.  What were you about\\r\\nsaying, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a\\r\\nsort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,\\r\\nand was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity\\'s gift, and\\r\\nthat was freely given to the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 73\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale\\'s\\r\\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod\\'s side.  But we must let it\\r\\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\\r\\nit.  For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now\\r\\nfor the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\\r\\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\\r\\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\\r\\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\\r\\nanywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture\\r\\nof those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not\\r\\ncommissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed\\r\\nnumbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now\\r\\nthat a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the\\r\\nsurprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should\\r\\nbe captured that day, if opportunity offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\\r\\nboats, Stubb\\'s and Flask\\'s, were detached in pursuit.  Pulling\\r\\nfurther and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the\\r\\nmen at the mast-head.  But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great\\r\\nheap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft\\r\\nthat one or both the boats must be fast.  An interval passed and the\\r\\nboats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards\\r\\nthe ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the\\r\\nhull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly\\r\\ngoing down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly\\r\\ndisappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.  \"Cut, cut!\" was\\r\\nthe cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on\\r\\nthe point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel\\'s\\r\\nside.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not\\r\\nsounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the\\r\\nsame time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.\\r\\nFor a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while\\r\\nthey still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still\\r\\nplied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take\\r\\nthem under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.\\r\\nAnd they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift\\r\\ntremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the\\r\\nstrained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under\\r\\nher bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,\\r\\nthat the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the\\r\\nwhale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to\\r\\nfly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his\\r\\ncourse, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after\\r\\nhim, so that they performed a complete circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\\r\\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for\\r\\nlance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\\r\\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale\\'s\\r\\nbody, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking\\r\\nat every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting\\r\\nfountains that poured from the smitten rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\\r\\nturned upon his back a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his\\r\\nflukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,\\r\\nsome conversation ensued between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\" said\\r\\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with\\r\\nso ignoble a leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wants with it?\" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\\'s\\r\\nbow, \"did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\'s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a\\r\\nRight Whale\\'s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that\\r\\nship can never afterwards capsize?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying\\r\\nso, and he seems to know all about ships\\' charms.  But I sometimes\\r\\nthink he\\'ll charm the ship to no good at last.  I don\\'t half like\\r\\nthat chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort\\r\\nof carved into a snake\\'s head, Stubb?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of\\r\\na dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;\\r\\nlook down there, Flask\"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion\\r\\nof both hands--\"Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the\\r\\ndevil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his\\r\\nhaving been stowed away on board ship?  He\\'s the devil, I say.  The\\r\\nreason why you don\\'t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of\\r\\nsight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.  Blast him!\\r\\nnow that I think of it, he\\'s always wanting oakum to stuff into the\\r\\ntoes of his boots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He sleeps in his boots, don\\'t he?  He hasn\\'t got any hammock; but\\r\\nI\\'ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt, and it\\'s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do\\r\\nye see, in the eye of the rigging.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the old man have so much to do with him for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bargain?--about what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and\\r\\nthe devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away\\r\\nhis silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then\\r\\nhe\\'ll surrender Moby Dick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\\r\\none, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the\\r\\nold flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\\r\\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.  Well,\\r\\nhe was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.  The devil,\\r\\nswitching his hoofs, up and says, \\'I want John.\\'  \\'What for?\\' says\\r\\nthe old governor.  \\'What business is that of yours,\\' says the devil,\\r\\ngetting mad,--\\'I want to use him.\\'  \\'Take him,\\' says the\\r\\ngovernor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn\\'t give John the\\r\\nAsiatic cholera before he got through with him, I\\'ll eat this whale\\r\\nin one mouthful.  But look sharp--ain\\'t you all ready there?  Well,\\r\\nthen, pull ahead, and let\\'s get the whale alongside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I remember some such story as you were telling,\" said Flask,\\r\\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\\r\\ntowards the ship, \"but I can\\'t remember where.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?\\r\\nDid ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now, tell me,\\r\\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,\\r\\nwas the same you say is now on board the Pequod?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn\\'t the devil\\r\\nlive for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?  Did you ever\\r\\nsee any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?  And if the devil\\r\\nhas a latch-key to get into the admiral\\'s cabin, don\\'t you suppose he\\r\\ncan crawl into a porthole?  Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you see that mainmast there?\" pointing to the ship; \"well, that\\'s\\r\\nthe figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod\\'s hold, and\\r\\nstring along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,\\r\\nthat wouldn\\'t begin to be Fedallah\\'s age.  Nor all the coopers in\\r\\ncreation couldn\\'t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that\\r\\nyou meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.\\r\\nNow, if he\\'s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is\\r\\ngoing to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him\\r\\noverboard--tell me that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give him a good ducking, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'d crawl back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Duck him again; and keep ducking him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes,\\r\\nand drown you--what then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to see him try it; I\\'d give him such a pair of black\\r\\neyes that he wouldn\\'t dare to show his face in the admiral\\'s cabin\\r\\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\\r\\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.\\r\\nDamn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I\\'m afraid of the devil?  Who\\'s\\r\\nafraid of him, except the old governor who daresn\\'t catch him and put\\r\\nhim in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about\\r\\nkidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the\\r\\npeople the devil kidnapped, he\\'d roast for him?  There\\'s a governor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do I suppose it?  You\\'ll know it before long, Flask.  But I am going\\r\\nnow to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very\\r\\nsuspicious going on, I\\'ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and\\r\\nsay--Look here, Beelzebub, you don\\'t do it; and if he makes any fuss,\\r\\nby the Lord I\\'ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to\\r\\nthe capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail\\r\\nwill come short off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather\\r\\nguess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he\\'ll sneak\\r\\noff without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his\\r\\nlegs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,\\r\\nStubb?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,\\r\\nwhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for\\r\\nsecuring him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you so?\" said Flask; \"yes, you\\'ll soon see this right\\r\\nwhale\\'s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn good time, Flask\\'s saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod\\r\\nsteeply leaned over towards the sperm whale\\'s head, now, by the\\r\\ncounterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely\\r\\nstrained, you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in\\r\\nLocke\\'s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist\\r\\nin Kant\\'s and you come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus,\\r\\nsome minds for ever keep trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all\\r\\nthese thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and\\r\\nright.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\\r\\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\\r\\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\\r\\noff whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately\\r\\nremoved and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone\\r\\nattached to what is called the crown-piece.  But nothing like this,\\r\\nin the present case, had been done.  The carcases of both whales had\\r\\ndropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule\\r\\ncarrying a pair of overburdening panniers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\\'s head, and ever\\r\\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his\\r\\nown hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\\r\\nshadow; while, if the Parsee\\'s shadow was there at all it seemed only\\r\\nto blend with, and lengthen Ahab\\'s.  As the crew toiled on,\\r\\nLaplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these\\r\\npassing things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 74\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sperm Whale\\'s Head--Contrasted View.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\\r\\njoin them, and lay together our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\\r\\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\\r\\nregularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\\r\\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\\r\\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\\r\\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\\'s side; and as we\\r\\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\\r\\ndeck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\\r\\nto study practical cetology than here?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\\r\\nthese heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\\r\\nis a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\\'s which the\\r\\nRight Whale\\'s sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\'s head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\\r\\nsuperiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\\r\\ninstance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\\r\\ncolour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\\r\\nlarge experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\\r\\ncall a \"grey-headed whale.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\\r\\ntwo most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\\r\\nof the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale\\'s jaw, if\\r\\nyou narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\\r\\nwould fancy to be a young colt\\'s eye; so out of all proportion is it\\r\\nto the magnitude of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\\'s eyes, it is\\r\\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\\r\\nthan he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\\r\\nwhale\\'s eyes corresponds to that of a man\\'s ears; and you may fancy,\\r\\nfor yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\\r\\nobjects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\\r\\ncommand some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\\r\\nside-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\\r\\nbitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\\r\\nin broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\\r\\nwere stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\\r\\nbacks, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\\r\\nfronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\\r\\nbut his eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\\r\\neyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\\r\\nas to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\\r\\nposition of the whale\\'s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\\r\\ncubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\\r\\nmountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\\r\\nwholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\\r\\nThe whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\\r\\nand another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\\r\\nprofound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\\r\\nsaid to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\\r\\nsashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\\r\\nseparately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\\r\\nthe view.  This peculiarity of the whale\\'s eyes is a thing always to\\r\\nbe borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\\r\\nin some subsequent scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\\r\\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\\r\\na hint.  So long as a man\\'s eyes are open in the light, the act of\\r\\nseeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\\r\\nseeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one\\'s\\r\\nexperience will teach him, that though he can take in an\\r\\nundiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\\r\\nimpossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\\r\\nthings--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\\r\\nof time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\\r\\nBut if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\\r\\nby a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\\r\\nin such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\\r\\nbe utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\\r\\nthen, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\\r\\nsimultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\\r\\ncombining, and subtle than man\\'s, that he can at the same moment of\\r\\ntime attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\\r\\nhim, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\\r\\nis it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\\r\\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\\r\\nproblems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\\r\\nincongruity in this comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\\r\\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\\r\\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\\r\\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\\r\\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\\r\\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are\\r\\nan entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\\r\\nfor hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\\r\\nleaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\\r\\nquill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\\r\\neye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\\r\\nobserved between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of\\r\\nthe former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely\\r\\nand evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite\\r\\nimperceptible from without.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\\r\\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\\r\\nwhich is smaller than a hare\\'s?  But if his eyes were broad as the\\r\\nlens of Herschel\\'s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the\\r\\nporches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or\\r\\nsharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to \"enlarge\"\\r\\nyour mind?  Subtilize it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,\\r\\ncant over the sperm whale\\'s head, that it may lie bottom up;\\r\\nthen, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the\\r\\nmouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from\\r\\nit, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth\\r\\nCave of his stomach.  But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look\\r\\nabout us where we are.  What a really beautiful and chaste-looking\\r\\nmouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a\\r\\nglistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\\r\\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at\\r\\none end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up, so as to get it\\r\\noverhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific\\r\\nportcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the\\r\\nfishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.  But far\\r\\nmore terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see\\r\\nsome sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw,\\r\\nsome fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles with\\r\\nhis body, for all the world like a ship\\'s jib-boom.  This whale is\\r\\nnot dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;\\r\\nhypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have\\r\\nrelaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\\r\\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws\\r\\nupon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised\\r\\nartist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of\\r\\nextracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard\\r\\nwhite whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious\\r\\narticles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to\\r\\nriding-whips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were\\r\\nan anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the\\r\\nother work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished\\r\\ndentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a keen cutting-spade,\\r\\nQueequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts,\\r\\nand a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as\\r\\nMichigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands.  There\\r\\nare generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,\\r\\nbut undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.  The jaw is\\r\\nafterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building\\r\\nhouses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 75\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Right Whale\\'s Head--Contrasted View.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\\r\\nWhale\\'s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale\\'s head may be compared to a\\r\\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\\r\\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale\\'s head bears a rather\\r\\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred\\r\\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\\r\\nshoemaker\\'s last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of\\r\\nthe nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\\r\\nlodged, she and all her progeny.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume\\r\\ndifferent aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on\\r\\nits summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take\\r\\nthe whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the\\r\\napertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye\\r\\nupon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the\\r\\nmass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the\\r\\n\"crown,\" and the Southern fishers the \"bonnet\" of the Right Whale;\\r\\nfixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the\\r\\ntrunk of some huge oak, with a bird\\'s nest in its crotch.  At any\\r\\nrate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this\\r\\nbonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,\\r\\nindeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term \"crown\" also\\r\\nbestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in\\r\\nthinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the\\r\\nsea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this\\r\\nmarvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky\\r\\nlooking fellow to grace a diadem.  Look at that hanging lower lip!\\r\\nwhat a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter\\'s\\r\\nmeasurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and\\r\\npout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\\r\\nThe fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during an\\r\\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\\r\\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a\\r\\nslippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.  Upon my word were I\\r\\nat Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.\\r\\nGood Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about\\r\\ntwelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were\\r\\na regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,\\r\\npresent us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats\\r\\nof whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the\\r\\nupper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds\\r\\nwhich have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these\\r\\nbones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale\\r\\nstrains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small\\r\\nfish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding\\r\\ntime.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural\\r\\norder, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,\\r\\nwhereby some whalemen calculate the creature\\'s age, as the age of an\\r\\noak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is\\r\\nfar from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical\\r\\nprobability.  At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far\\r\\ngreater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem\\r\\nreasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\\r\\nconcerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the\\r\\nwondrous \"whiskers\" inside of the whale\\'s mouth;* another, \"hogs\\'\\r\\nbristles\"; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following\\r\\nelegant language: \"There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing\\r\\non each side of his upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each\\r\\nside of his mouth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,\\r\\nor rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on\\r\\nthe upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.  Sometimes these\\r\\ntufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs every one knows, these same \"hogs\\' bristles,\" \"fins,\" \"whiskers,\"\\r\\n\"blinds,\" or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks\\r\\nand other stiffening contrivances.  But in this particular, the\\r\\ndemand has long been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne\\'s time\\r\\nthat the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the\\r\\nfashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the\\r\\njaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the\\r\\nlike thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for\\r\\nprotection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\\r\\nstanding in the Right Whale\\'s mouth, look around you afresh.  Seeing\\r\\nall these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you\\r\\nnot think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing\\r\\nupon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of\\r\\nthe softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the\\r\\nfloor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in\\r\\npieces in hoisting it on deck.  This particular tongue now before us;\\r\\nat a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it\\r\\nwill yield you about that amount of oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\\r\\nwith--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\\r\\ndifferent heads.  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale\\'s there is no\\r\\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\\r\\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale\\'s.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are\\r\\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\\r\\nanything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external\\r\\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\\r\\nlie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the\\r\\nother will not be very long in following.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale\\'s there?  It is the\\r\\nsame he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead\\r\\nseem now faded away.  I think his broad brow to be full of a\\r\\nprairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to\\r\\ndeath.  But mark the other head\\'s expression.  See that amazing lower\\r\\nlip, pressed by accident against the vessel\\'s side, so as firmly to\\r\\nembrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an\\r\\nenormous practical resolution in facing death?  This Right Whale I\\r\\ntake to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might\\r\\nhave taken up Spinoza in his latter years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 76\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battering-Ram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\\'s head, I would have\\r\\nyou, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its\\r\\nfront aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you\\r\\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\\r\\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power\\r\\nmay be lodged there.  Here is a vital point; for you must either\\r\\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain\\r\\nan infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true\\r\\nevents, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane\\r\\nto the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\\r\\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the\\r\\nlong socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that\\r\\nthe mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,\\r\\nas though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you\\r\\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\\r\\nhas--his spout hole--is on the top of his head; you observe that his\\r\\neyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his\\r\\nentire length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived\\r\\nthat the front of the Sperm Whale\\'s head is a dead, blind wall,\\r\\nwithout a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.\\r\\nFurthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower,\\r\\nbackward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the\\r\\nslightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from\\r\\nthe forehead do you come to the full cranial development.  So that\\r\\nthis whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.  Finally, though, as\\r\\nwill soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate\\r\\noil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance\\r\\nwhich so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.  In some\\r\\nprevious place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body\\r\\nof the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so with the head;\\r\\nbut with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so\\r\\nthick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not\\r\\nhandled it.  The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted\\r\\nby the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.  It is as\\r\\nthough the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses\\' hoofs.\\r\\nI do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large, loaded\\r\\nIndiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the\\r\\ndocks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend between them, at\\r\\nthe point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or\\r\\nwood.  No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,\\r\\nenveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bravely and\\r\\nuninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken\\r\\nhandspikes and iron crow-bars.  By itself this sufficiently\\r\\nillustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,\\r\\nit has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess\\r\\nwhat is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of\\r\\ndistension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,\\r\\nhas no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise\\r\\ninexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether\\r\\nbeneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the\\r\\nwater; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;\\r\\nconsidering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically\\r\\noccurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs\\r\\nthere may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected\\r\\nconnexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric\\r\\ndistension and contraction.  If this be so, fancy the\\r\\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\\r\\ndestructive of all elements contributes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable\\r\\nwall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a\\r\\nmass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled\\r\\nwood is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the\\r\\nsmallest insect.  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all\\r\\nthe specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in\\r\\nthis expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\\r\\ninconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\\r\\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the\\r\\nSperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed\\r\\nthe Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your\\r\\neye-brow.  For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and\\r\\nsentimentalist in Truth.  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander\\r\\ngiants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials\\r\\nthen?  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess\\'s\\r\\nveil at Lais?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 77\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Heidelburgh Tun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright, you\\r\\nmust know something of the curious internal structure of the thing\\r\\noperated upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the Sperm Whale\\'s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\\r\\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the\\r\\nlower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the\\r\\nupper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end\\r\\nforming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.  At the\\r\\nmiddle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and\\r\\nthen you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally\\r\\ndivided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure nautical\\r\\nmathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.  A quoin is\\r\\na solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by\\r\\nthe steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of\\r\\nboth sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb\\r\\nof oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\\r\\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\\r\\nextent.  The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the\\r\\ngreat Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as that famous great\\r\\ntierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale\\'s vast plaited\\r\\nforehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical\\r\\nadornment of his wondrous tun.  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was\\r\\nalways replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the\\r\\nRhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most\\r\\nprecious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized\\r\\nspermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.\\r\\nNor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of\\r\\nthe creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon\\r\\nexposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending\\r\\nforth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate\\r\\nice is just forming in water.  A large whale\\'s case generally yields\\r\\nabout five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable\\r\\ncircumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles\\r\\naway, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of\\r\\nsecuring what you can.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\\r\\ncoated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\\r\\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\\r\\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\'s case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\\r\\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and\\r\\nsince--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third\\r\\nof the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at\\r\\neighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six\\r\\nfeet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and\\r\\ndown against a ship\\'s side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator\\'s instrument is brought\\r\\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\\r\\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,\\r\\nlest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and\\r\\nwastingly let out its invaluable contents.  It is this decapitated\\r\\nend of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water,\\r\\nand retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose\\r\\nhempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in\\r\\nthat quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous\\r\\nand--in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the\\r\\nSperm Whale\\'s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 78\\r\\n\\r\\nCistern and Buckets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his\\r\\nerect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,\\r\\nto the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has\\r\\ncarried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two\\r\\nparts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.  Securing this\\r\\nblock, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of\\r\\nthe rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck.\\r\\nThen, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through\\r\\nthe air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.\\r\\nThere--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he\\r\\nvivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good\\r\\npeople to prayers from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp\\r\\nspade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper\\r\\nplace to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds\\r\\nvery heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding\\r\\nthe walls to find where the gold is masoned in.  By the time this\\r\\ncautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\\r\\nwell-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\\r\\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\\r\\nthree alert hands.  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of\\r\\nthe Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\\r\\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\\r\\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the\\r\\nword to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all\\r\\nbubbling like a dairy-maid\\'s pail of new milk.  Carefully lowered\\r\\nfrom its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed\\r\\nhand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.  Then remounting aloft,\\r\\nit again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will\\r\\nyield no more.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole\\r\\nharder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some\\r\\ntwenty feet of the pole have gone down.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\\r\\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at\\r\\nonce a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego, that\\r\\nwild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment\\r\\nhis one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;\\r\\nor whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\\r\\nwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\\r\\nstating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no\\r\\ntelling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket\\r\\ncame suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating\\r\\nbucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this\\r\\ngreat Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went\\r\\nclean out of sight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man overboard!\" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation\\r\\nfirst came to his senses.  \"Swing the bucket this way!\" and putting\\r\\none foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold\\r\\non the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the\\r\\nhead, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.\\r\\nMeantime, there was a terrible tumult.  Looking over the side, they\\r\\nsaw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the\\r\\nsurface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous\\r\\nidea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by\\r\\nthose struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was\\r\\nclearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting\\r\\ntackles--a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable\\r\\nhorror of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore\\r\\nout, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till\\r\\nthe drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one\\r\\nremaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed\\r\\nevery instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more\\r\\nlikely from the violent motions of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come down, come down!\" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one\\r\\nhand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should\\r\\ndrop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the\\r\\nfoul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well,\\r\\nmeaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, man,\" cried Stubb, \"are you ramming home a\\r\\ncartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him; jamming that\\r\\niron-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, will ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand clear of the tackle!\" cried a voice like the bursting of a\\r\\nrocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\\r\\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara\\'s Table-Rock into the whirlpool;\\r\\nthe suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her\\r\\nglittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now\\r\\nover the sailors\\' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a\\r\\nthick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous\\r\\ntackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down\\r\\nto the bottom of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared\\r\\naway, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for\\r\\none swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.  The next, a loud\\r\\nsplash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One\\r\\npacked rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,\\r\\nas moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the\\r\\ndiver could be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside,\\r\\nand pushed a little off from the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! ha!\" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging\\r\\nperch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm\\r\\nthrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm\\r\\nthrust forth from the grass over a grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both! both!--it is both!\"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;\\r\\nand soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,\\r\\nand with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into\\r\\nthe waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego\\r\\nwas long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after\\r\\nthe slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made\\r\\nside lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;\\r\\nthen dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and\\r\\nupwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that\\r\\nupon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\\r\\nknowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\\r\\ntrouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and\\r\\ntoss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\\r\\ntrial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the\\r\\ngreat head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\\r\\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\\r\\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward\\r\\nand apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to\\r\\nbe forgotten.  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with\\r\\nfencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\\'s will be sure to\\r\\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\\r\\neither seen or heard of some one\\'s falling into a cistern ashore; an\\r\\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\\r\\nthe Indian\\'s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale\\'s well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?  We\\r\\nthought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the\\r\\nlightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink\\r\\nin an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.  We have\\r\\nthee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash\\r\\nfell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,\\r\\nleaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double\\r\\nwelded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than\\r\\nthe sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But\\r\\nthe tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present\\r\\ninstance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head\\r\\nremaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and\\r\\ndeliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing\\r\\nhis agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a\\r\\nrunning delivery, so it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\\r\\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\\r\\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\\r\\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale.  Only one sweeter end can readily\\r\\nbe recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking\\r\\nhoney in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of\\r\\nit, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died\\r\\nembalmed.  How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato\\'s\\r\\nhoney head, and sweetly perished there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 79\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\\r\\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\\r\\nas yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful\\r\\nas for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of\\r\\nGibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the\\r\\nDome of the Pantheon.  Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater\\r\\nnot only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively\\r\\nstudies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in\\r\\ndetail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein.  Nor\\r\\nhave Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints\\r\\ntouching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.\\r\\nTherefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the\\r\\napplication of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my\\r\\nendeavor.  I try all things; I achieve what I can.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.\\r\\nHe has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central and most\\r\\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\\r\\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\\r\\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely\\r\\naffect the countenance of the whale.  For as in landscape gardening,\\r\\na spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost\\r\\nindispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be\\r\\nphysiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of\\r\\nthe nose.  Dash the nose from Phidias\\'s marble Jove, and what a sorry\\r\\nremainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all\\r\\nhis proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\\r\\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it\\r\\nis an added grandeur.  A nose to the whale would have been\\r\\nimpertinent.  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his\\r\\nvast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never\\r\\ninsulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.  A\\r\\npestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even\\r\\nwhen beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view\\r\\nto be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.\\r\\nThis aspect is sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with\\r\\nthe morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the\\r\\nbull has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up\\r\\nmountain defiles, the elephant\\'s brow is majestic.  Human or animal,\\r\\nthe mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German\\r\\nEmperors to their decrees.  It signifies--\"God: done this day by my\\r\\nhand.\"  But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the\\r\\nbrow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.\\r\\nFew are the foreheads which like Shakespeare\\'s or Melancthon\\'s rise\\r\\nso high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,\\r\\neternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead\\'s\\r\\nwrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to\\r\\ndrink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.\\r\\nBut in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity\\r\\ninherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in\\r\\nthat full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more\\r\\nforcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.  For\\r\\nyou see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;\\r\\nno nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing\\r\\nbut that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;\\r\\ndumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Nor, in\\r\\nprofile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its\\r\\ngrandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile, you plainly\\r\\nperceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the\\r\\nforehead\\'s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\\'s mark of genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale ever\\r\\nwritten a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius is declared in\\r\\nhis doing nothing particular to prove it.  It is moreover declared in\\r\\nhis pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great\\r\\nSperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been\\r\\ndeified by their child-magian thoughts.  They deified the crocodile\\r\\nof the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale\\r\\nhas no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be\\r\\nincapable of protrusion.  If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical\\r\\nnation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods\\r\\nof old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;\\r\\nin the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove\\'s high seat,\\r\\nthe great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\\r\\n\\r\\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But there\\r\\nis no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\\'s and every\\r\\nbeing\\'s face.  Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a\\r\\npassing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty\\r\\nlanguages, could not read the simplest peasant\\'s face in its\\r\\nprofounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope\\r\\nto read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale\\'s brow?  I but put that\\r\\nbrow before you.  Read it if you can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 80\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\\r\\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\\r\\nsquare.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty\\r\\nfeet in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this\\r\\nskull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting\\r\\nthroughout on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere\\r\\nseen--this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared\\r\\nby the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the\\r\\nhigh end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while\\r\\nunder the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom\\r\\nexceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth--reposes the\\r\\nmere handful of this monster\\'s brain.  The brain is at least twenty\\r\\nfeet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its\\r\\nvast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified\\r\\nfortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket is it secreted in\\r\\nhim, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the\\r\\nSperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one\\r\\nformed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.  Lying in strange\\r\\nfolds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems\\r\\nmore in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\\r\\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,\\r\\nin the creature\\'s living intact state, is an entire delusion.  As for\\r\\nhis true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.\\r\\nThe whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\\r\\ncommon world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\\r\\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\\r\\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and\\r\\nfrom the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull\\r\\n(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men\\'s skulls,\\r\\nand you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the\\r\\ndepressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you\\r\\nwould say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by\\r\\nthose negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his\\r\\nprodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,\\r\\nthough not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted\\r\\npotency is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\\'s proper brain,\\r\\nyou deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have\\r\\nanother idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any\\r\\nquadruped\\'s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its\\r\\nvertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing\\r\\nrudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,\\r\\nthat the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the\\r\\ncurious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the\\r\\nfirst men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,\\r\\nin the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of\\r\\nwhich he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow\\r\\nof his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an\\r\\nimportant thing in not pushing their investigations from the\\r\\ncerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a\\r\\nman\\'s character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would\\r\\nrather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin\\r\\njoist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice\\r\\nin my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I\\r\\nfling half out to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His\\r\\ncranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in\\r\\nthat vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches\\r\\nacross, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the\\r\\nbase downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the\\r\\ncanal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\\r\\nlarge capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the\\r\\nsame strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and\\r\\ndirectly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for\\r\\nmany feet after emerging from the brain\\'s cavity, the spinal cord\\r\\nremains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.\\r\\nUnder all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and\\r\\nmap out the whale\\'s spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this\\r\\nlight, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\\r\\nmore than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his\\r\\nspinal cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\\r\\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale\\'s hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises\\r\\nover one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,\\r\\nthe outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I\\r\\nshould call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness\\r\\nin the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you\\r\\nwill yet have reason to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 81\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\\r\\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\\r\\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\\r\\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\\r\\ntheir flag in the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\\r\\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and\\r\\ndropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently\\r\\nstanding in the bows instead of the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What has he in his hand there?\" cried Starbuck, pointing to\\r\\nsomething wavingly held by the German.  \"Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that,\" said Stubb, \"no, no, it\\'s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;\\r\\nhe\\'s coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don\\'t you see\\r\\nthat big tin can there alongside of him?--that\\'s his boiling water.\\r\\nOh! he\\'s all right, is the Yarman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go along with you,\" cried Flask, \"it\\'s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.\\r\\nHe\\'s out of oil, and has come a-begging.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on\\r\\nthe whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the\\r\\nold proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a\\r\\nthing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer\\r\\ndid indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\\r\\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\\r\\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\\r\\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\\r\\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\\r\\nprofound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\\r\\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding\\r\\nby hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is\\r\\ntechnically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well\\r\\ndeserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\\r\\nship\\'s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\\r\\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,\\r\\nthat without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he\\r\\nslewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\\r\\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s keels.  There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of\\r\\ntheir danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight\\r\\nbefore the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of\\r\\nhorses in harness.  They left a great, wide wake, as though\\r\\ncontinually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\\r\\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\\r\\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\\r\\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.  Whether this\\r\\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\\r\\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\\r\\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\\r\\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\\r\\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\\r\\ncurrents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming\\r\\nforth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn\\r\\nshreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which\\r\\nseemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the\\r\\nwaters behind him to upbubble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s got some paregoric?\" said Stubb, \"he has the stomach-ache, I\\'m\\r\\nafraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse\\r\\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.  It\\'s the first foul\\r\\nwind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw\\r\\nso before? it must be, he\\'s lost his tiller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\\r\\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\\r\\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then\\r\\npartly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his\\r\\ndevious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.  Whether he\\r\\nhad lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were\\r\\nhard to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I\\'ll give ye a sling for that wounded\\r\\narm,\" cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind he don\\'t sling thee with it,\" cried Starbuck.  \"Give way, or\\r\\nthe German will have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this\\r\\none fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\\r\\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\\r\\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit\\r\\nfor the time.  At this juncture the Pequod\\'s keels had shot by the\\r\\nthree German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\\r\\nDerick\\'s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\\r\\nforeign rivals.  The only thing they feared, was, that from being\\r\\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\\r\\nbefore they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,\\r\\nhe seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and\\r\\noccasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the\\r\\nother boats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!\" cried Starbuck; \"he mocks and\\r\\ndares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\\r\\nago!\"--then in his old intense whisper--\"Give way, greyhounds!  Dog\\r\\nto it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell ye what it is, men\"--cried Stubb to his crew--\"it\\'s against\\r\\nmy religion to get mad; but I\\'d like to eat that villainous\\r\\nYarman--Pull--won\\'t ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do\\r\\nye love brandy?  A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come,\\r\\nwhy don\\'t some of ye burst a blood-vessel?  Who\\'s that been dropping\\r\\nan anchor overboard--we don\\'t budge an inch--we\\'re becalmed.  Halloo,\\r\\nhere\\'s grass growing in the boat\\'s bottom--and by the Lord, the mast\\r\\nthere\\'s budding.  This won\\'t do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The\\r\\nshort and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! see the suds he makes!\" cried Flask, dancing up and down--\"What\\r\\na hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads, DO\\r\\nspring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked\\r\\nclams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he\\'s a hundred barreller--don\\'t\\r\\nlose him now--don\\'t oh, DON\\'T!--see that Yarman--Oh,\\r\\nwon\\'t ye pull for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!\\r\\nDon\\'t ye love sperm?  There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a\\r\\nbank!--a whole bank!  The bank of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What\\'s\\r\\nthat Yarman about now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at\\r\\nthe advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double\\r\\nview of retarding his rivals\\' way, and at the same time economically\\r\\naccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!\" cried Stubb.  \"Pull now, men, like\\r\\nfifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.  What\\r\\nd\\'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in\\r\\ntwo-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead?  What d\\'ye say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, pull like god-dam,\"--cried the Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the\\r\\nPequod\\'s three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so\\r\\ndisposed, momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous\\r\\nattitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three\\r\\nmates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with\\r\\nan exhilarating cry of, \"There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the\\r\\nwhite-ash breeze!  Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\\r\\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had\\r\\nnot a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught\\r\\nthe blade of his midship oarsman.  While this clumsy lubber was\\r\\nstriving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick\\'s\\r\\nboat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a\\r\\nmighty rage;--that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.\\r\\nWith a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly\\r\\nranged up on the German\\'s quarter.  An instant more, and all four\\r\\nboats were diagonically in the whale\\'s immediate wake, while\\r\\nstretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was\\r\\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\\r\\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\\r\\nfright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\\r\\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically\\r\\nsank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating\\r\\nfin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted\\r\\nbroken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical\\r\\nhawks.  But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make\\r\\nknown her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was\\r\\nchained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking\\r\\nrespiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him\\r\\nunspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis\\r\\njaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man\\r\\nwho so pitied.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nboats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,\\r\\nDerick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually\\r\\nlong dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\\r\\nthree tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to\\r\\ntheir feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed\\r\\ntheir barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their\\r\\nthree Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapours of foam and\\r\\nwhite-fire!  The three boats, in the first fury of the whale\\'s\\r\\nheadlong rush, bumped the German\\'s aside with such force, that both\\r\\nDerick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over\\r\\nby the three flying keels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\" cried Stubb, casting a passing\\r\\nglance upon them as he shot by; \"ye\\'ll be picked up presently--all\\r\\nright--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard\\'s dogs, you\\r\\nknow--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail\\r\\nnow.  Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin\\r\\nkettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind of\\r\\nfastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--makes the\\r\\nwheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there\\'s\\r\\ndanger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.  Hurrah!\\r\\nthis is the way a fellow feels when he\\'s going to Davy Jones--all a\\r\\nrush down an endless inclined plane!  Hurrah! this whale carries the\\r\\neverlasting mail!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the monster\\'s run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he\\r\\ntumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew\\r\\nround the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in\\r\\nthem; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding\\r\\nwould soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,\\r\\nthey caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\\r\\nlast--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\\r\\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the\\r\\nblue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while\\r\\nthe three sterns tilted high in the air.  And the whale soon ceasing\\r\\nto sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of\\r\\nexpending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But\\r\\nthough boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is\\r\\nthis \"holding on,\" as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp\\r\\nbarbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\\r\\nthe Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his\\r\\nfoes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\\r\\ndoubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\\r\\nreasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\\r\\nwater, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\\r\\nsurface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\\r\\nsquare feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\\r\\nan astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\\r\\nhere, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\\r\\nwhale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\\r\\nIt must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\\r\\nhas estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with\\r\\nall their guns, and stores, and men on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\\r\\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\\r\\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\\r\\ndepths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\\r\\nsilence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\\r\\nand wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\\r\\nvisible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin\\r\\nthreads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an\\r\\neight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.\\r\\nIs this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--\"Canst\\r\\nthou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?\\r\\nThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,\\r\\nnor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make\\r\\nhim flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of\\r\\na spear!\"  This the creature? this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should\\r\\nfollow the prophets.  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in\\r\\nhis tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,\\r\\nto hide him from the Pequod\\'s fish-spears!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\\r\\nsent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\\r\\nenough to shade half Xerxes\\' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the\\r\\nwounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his\\r\\nhead!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines\\r\\nsuddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to\\r\\nthem, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,\\r\\nso that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,\\r\\nrelieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\\r\\nboats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a\\r\\ndense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haul in!  Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he\\'s rising.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand\\'s breadth\\r\\ncould have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\\r\\ndripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\\r\\nship\\'s lengths of the hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land\\r\\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\\r\\nveins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\\r\\ninstantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one\\r\\nof whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure\\r\\nof the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point\\r\\nas a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\\r\\narterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary\\r\\npressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may\\r\\nbe said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\\r\\nquantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\\r\\nfountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\\r\\nconsiderable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\\r\\nsource is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.\\r\\nEven now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew\\r\\nover his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\\r\\nwere followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\\r\\ncontinually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was\\r\\nonly at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture\\r\\ninto the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no\\r\\nvital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they\\r\\nsignificantly call it, was untouched.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\\r\\nhis form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\\r\\nrevealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,\\r\\nwere beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of\\r\\nthe noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale\\'s\\r\\neyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable\\r\\nto see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one\\r\\narm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\\r\\norder to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and\\r\\nalso to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\\r\\ninoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last\\r\\nhe partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,\\r\\nthe size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there\\'s no need of that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an\\r\\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\\r\\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\\r\\nswift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\\r\\nglorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask\\'s boat\\r\\nand marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,\\r\\nso spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\\r\\nthe wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\\r\\nwith his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\\r\\nwaning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a\\r\\nlog, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As\\r\\nwhen by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\\r\\nmighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\\r\\nspray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying\\r\\nspout of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\\r\\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\\r\\nImmediately, by Starbuck\\'s orders, lines were secured to it at\\r\\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\\r\\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\\r\\nvery heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\\r\\ntransferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\\r\\nstiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\\r\\nupheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\\r\\nspade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\\r\\nhis flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\\r\\nthe stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\\r\\ncaptured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\\r\\nprominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\\r\\nneeds have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\\r\\nto account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\\r\\nthe fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\\r\\nthe buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\\r\\nthat stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor\\'\\r\\nWest Indian long before America was discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\\r\\ncabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further\\r\\ndiscoveries, by the ship\\'s being unprecedentedly dragged over\\r\\nsideways to the sea, owing to the body\\'s immensely increasing\\r\\ntendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\\r\\naffairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\\r\\nindeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\\r\\nstill persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\\r\\ncommand was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\\r\\nstrain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\\r\\nwere fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime\\r\\neverything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of\\r\\nthe deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The\\r\\nship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks\\r\\nand cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\\r\\ndislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon\\r\\nthe immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;\\r\\nand so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\\r\\nnot be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of\\r\\nponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on\\r\\nthe point of going over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold on, hold on, won\\'t ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don\\'t be in\\r\\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do\\r\\nsomething or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your\\r\\nhandspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\\r\\ncut the big chains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Knife?  Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\\'s heavy\\r\\nhatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\\r\\nslashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of\\r\\nsparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\\r\\nWith a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\\r\\nthe carcase sank.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\\r\\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\\r\\naccounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\\r\\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\\r\\nsurface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\\r\\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\\r\\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\\r\\nthat this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\\r\\nfish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\\r\\nhim.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and\\r\\nswelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm\\r\\nflush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\\r\\nthese brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\\r\\naccident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,\\r\\ntwenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt\\r\\nimputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\\r\\nRight Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a\\r\\nton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there\\r\\nare instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\\r\\nthe sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the\\r\\nreason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to\\r\\na prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A\\r\\nline-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore\\r\\nWhaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right\\r\\nWhale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty\\r\\nof rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look\\r\\nfor it when it shall have ascended again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard\\r\\nfrom the Pequod\\'s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\\r\\nlowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\\r\\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\\r\\nits incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless, the Fin-Back\\'s spout\\r\\nis so similar to the Sperm Whale\\'s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\\r\\noften mistaken for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host were\\r\\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding\\r\\nall sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all\\r\\ndisappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 82\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Honour and Glory of Whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the\\r\\ntrue method.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches\\r\\nup to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with\\r\\nits great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so\\r\\nmany great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way\\r\\nor other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the\\r\\nreflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so\\r\\nemblazoned a fraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to\\r\\nthe eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale\\r\\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\\r\\nThose were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore\\r\\narms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men\\'s lamp-feeders.\\r\\nEvery one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the\\r\\nlovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the\\r\\nsea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,\\r\\nPerseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the\\r\\nmonster, and delivered and married the maid.  It was an admirable\\r\\nartistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the\\r\\npresent day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first\\r\\ndart.  And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient\\r\\nJoppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,\\r\\nthere stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the\\r\\ncity\\'s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical\\r\\nbones of the monster that Perseus slew.  When the Romans took Joppa,\\r\\nthe same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.  What seems most\\r\\nsingular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was\\r\\nfrom Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some\\r\\nsupposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of\\r\\nSt. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a\\r\\nwhale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely\\r\\njumbled together, and often stand for each other.  \"Thou art as a\\r\\nlion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,\" saith Ezekiel;\\r\\nhereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible\\r\\nuse that word itself.  Besides, it would much subtract from the glory\\r\\nof the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of\\r\\nthe land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.\\r\\nAny man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a\\r\\nCoffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\\r\\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\r\\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is\\r\\ndepicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the\\r\\ngreat ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was\\r\\nunknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus\\' case, St.\\r\\nGeorge\\'s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and\\r\\nconsidering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only\\r\\na large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not\\r\\nappear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the\\r\\nancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no\\r\\nother than the great Leviathan himself.  In fact, placed before the\\r\\nstrict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish,\\r\\nflesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being\\r\\nplanted before the ark of Israel, his horse\\'s head and both the palms\\r\\nof his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of\\r\\nhim remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a\\r\\nwhaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we\\r\\nharpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order\\r\\nof St. George.  And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable\\r\\ncompany (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a\\r\\nwhale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with\\r\\ndisdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are\\r\\nmuch better entitled to St. George\\'s decoration than they.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\\r\\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\\r\\nantique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good\\r\\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether\\r\\nthat strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.  It\\r\\nnowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless,\\r\\nindeed, from the inside.  Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of\\r\\ninvoluntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not\\r\\nthe whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\\r\\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still\\r\\nmore ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;\\r\\ncertainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then, why\\r\\nnot the prophet?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the\\r\\nwhole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named; for\\r\\nlike royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our\\r\\nfraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.  That\\r\\nwondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,\\r\\nwhich gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the\\r\\ngodhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our\\r\\nLord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,\\r\\nhas for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.  When Brahma, or the\\r\\nGod of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after\\r\\none of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to\\r\\npreside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose\\r\\nperusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before\\r\\nbeginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\\r\\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\\r\\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\\r\\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost\\r\\ndepths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman,\\r\\nthen? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there\\'s a\\r\\nmember-roll for you!  What club but the whaleman\\'s can head off like\\r\\nthat?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 83\\r\\n\\r\\nJonah Historically Regarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\\r\\nthe preceding chapter.  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\\r\\nhistorical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some\\r\\nsceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox\\r\\npagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the\\r\\nwhale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those\\r\\ntraditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for\\r\\nall that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\\'s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\\r\\nstory was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\\r\\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\\r\\nrepresented Jonah\\'s whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity\\r\\nonly true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right\\r\\nWhale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the\\r\\nfishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his\\r\\nswallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb\\'s anticipative\\r\\nanswer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\\r\\nconsider Jonah as tombed in the whale\\'s belly, but as temporarily\\r\\nlodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\\r\\nin the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale\\'s mouth would\\r\\naccommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\\r\\nplayers.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\\r\\nhollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\\r\\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely\\r\\nin reference to his incarcerated body and the whale\\'s gastric juices.\\r\\nBut this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\\r\\nexegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\\r\\nbody of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\\r\\ncampaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\\r\\nBesides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\\r\\nwhen Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\\r\\neffected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\\r\\nwhale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\\r\\nWhale,\" as some craft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the\\r\\n\"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\"  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists\\r\\nwho have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely\\r\\nmeant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered\\r\\nprophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.  Poor\\r\\nSag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.  But he had still\\r\\nanother reason for his want of faith.  It was this, if I remember\\r\\nright: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and\\r\\nafter three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days\\'\\r\\njourney of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three\\r\\ndays\\' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean\\r\\ncoast.  How is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\\r\\nthat short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him\\r\\nround by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak of the\\r\\npassage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another\\r\\npassage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would\\r\\ninvolve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days,\\r\\nnot to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being\\r\\ntoo shallow for any whale to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah\\'s\\r\\nweathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the\\r\\nhonour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,\\r\\nits reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\\r\\nfoolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,\\r\\nseeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up\\r\\nfrom the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious\\r\\npride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend\\r\\nclergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of\\r\\nJonah\\'s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a\\r\\nsignal magnification of the general miracle.  And so it was.\\r\\nBesides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe\\r\\nin the historical story of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an\\r\\nEnglish traveller in old Harris\\'s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque\\r\\nbuilt in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that\\r\\nburnt without any oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 84\\r\\n\\r\\nPitchpoling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\\r\\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\\r\\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.  Nor is\\r\\nit to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may\\r\\npossibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and\\r\\nwater are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object\\r\\nin view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed\\r\\nstrongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the\\r\\nGerman ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in\\r\\nthat occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the\\r\\nside, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to\\r\\ninsure a crop of hair from the craft\\'s bald keel.  He seemed to be\\r\\nworking in obedience to some particular presentiment.  Nor did it\\r\\nremain unwarranted by the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down\\r\\nto them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered\\r\\nflight, as of Cleopatra\\'s barges from Actium.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb\\'s was foremost.  By great\\r\\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\\r\\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his\\r\\nhorizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted\\r\\nstrainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably\\r\\nextract it.  It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be\\r\\ncontent to lose him.  But to haul the boat up to his flank was\\r\\nimpossible, he swam so fast and furious.  What then remained?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\\r\\ncountless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often\\r\\nforced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called\\r\\npitchpoling.  Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises\\r\\nboasts nothing like it.  It is only indispensable with an inveterate\\r\\nrunning whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance\\r\\nto which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently\\r\\nrocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.  Steel and wood\\r\\nincluded, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the\\r\\nstaff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a\\r\\nlighter material--pine.  It is furnished with a small rope called a\\r\\nwarp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the\\r\\nhand after darting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that\\r\\nthough the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,\\r\\nyet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently\\r\\nsuccessful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of\\r\\nthe harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become\\r\\nserious drawbacks.  As a general thing, therefore, you must first\\r\\nget fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness\\r\\nand equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to\\r\\nexcel in pitchpoling.  Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed\\r\\nbow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is\\r\\nforty feet ahead.  Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or\\r\\nthrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb\\r\\nwhistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to\\r\\nsecure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.\\r\\nThen holding the lance full before his waistband\\'s middle, he levels\\r\\nit at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses\\r\\nthe butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon\\r\\nstands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.  He\\r\\nminds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.\\r\\nNext moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the\\r\\nbright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot\\r\\nof the whale.  Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That drove the spigot out of him!\" cried Stubb.  \"\\'Tis July\\'s\\r\\nimmortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!  Would now, it\\r\\nwere old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old\\r\\nMonongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I\\'d have ye hold a canakin to the\\r\\njet, and we\\'d drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive, we\\'d brew\\r\\nchoice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that\\r\\nlive punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is\\r\\nrepeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in\\r\\nskilful leash.  The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line\\r\\nis slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,\\r\\nand mutely watches the monster die.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 85\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of\\r\\nages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the\\r\\nsea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with\\r\\nso many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries\\r\\nback, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of\\r\\nthe whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this\\r\\nshould be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a\\r\\nquarter minutes past one o\\'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of\\r\\nDecember, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these\\r\\nspoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is\\r\\nsurely a noteworthy thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\\r\\ncontingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\\r\\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\\r\\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or\\r\\na cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\\r\\nsurface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\\r\\nregular lungs, like a human being\\'s, the whale can only live by\\r\\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the\\r\\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he\\r\\ncannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\\r\\nattitude, the Sperm Whale\\'s mouth is buried at least eight feet\\r\\nbeneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\\r\\nconnexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle\\r\\nalone; and this is on the top of his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\\r\\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\\r\\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with\\r\\nthe blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not\\r\\nthink I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\\r\\nscientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\\r\\na man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\\r\\nnostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to\\r\\nsay, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,\\r\\nthis is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,\\r\\nby intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\\r\\ndrawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle\\r\\nof air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his\\r\\nribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\\r\\ninvolved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,\\r\\nwhen he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated\\r\\nblood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\\r\\nhe carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel\\r\\ncrossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\\r\\nfuture use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact\\r\\nof this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded\\r\\nupon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\\r\\nconsider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in\\r\\nHAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I\\r\\nmean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\\r\\nwill continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\\r\\nother unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\\r\\nseventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\\r\\nrises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,\\r\\nto a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\\r\\nso that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good\\r\\nhis regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are\\r\\ntold, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.\\r\\nRemark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\\r\\ndifferent; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale\\r\\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\\r\\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\\r\\ntoo, that this necessity for the whale\\'s rising exposes him to all\\r\\nthe fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could\\r\\nthis vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms\\r\\nbeneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the\\r\\ngreat necessities that strike the victory to thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving\\r\\nfor two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has\\r\\nto attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.\\r\\nBut the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\\r\\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\\r\\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\\r\\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\\r\\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\\r\\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\\r\\nof smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be\\r\\nwater or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be\\r\\narrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm\\r\\nWhale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No\\r\\nroses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his\\r\\nspouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is\\r\\nfurnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\\r\\nretention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\\r\\nwhale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\\r\\nstrangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what\\r\\nhas the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that\\r\\nhad anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out\\r\\nsomething by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is\\r\\nsuch an excellent listener!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\\r\\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\\r\\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\\r\\nlittle to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\\r\\nlaid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question\\r\\nreturns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\\r\\nwhether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\\r\\nbreath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\\r\\nat the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\\r\\nthat the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\\r\\nit cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\\r\\nthrough the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\\r\\nwould seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\\r\\nBut the Sperm Whale\\'s food is far beneath the surface, and there he\\r\\ncannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very\\r\\nclosely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\\r\\nunmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his\\r\\njets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak\\r\\nout!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\\r\\nyou not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so\\r\\neasy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain\\r\\nthings the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might\\r\\nalmost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\\r\\nenveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls\\r\\nfrom it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\\r\\nclose view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\\r\\ncascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\\r\\nyou really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\\r\\nthat they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\\r\\nthat they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\\r\\nspout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\\r\\nwhale\\'s head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\\r\\nsea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\\'s in\\r\\nthe desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\\r\\nwater on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a\\r\\ncavity in a rock filled up with rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\\r\\nthe precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be\\r\\npeering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your\\r\\npitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even\\r\\nwhen coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the\\r\\njet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from\\r\\nthe acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who\\r\\ncoming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\\r\\nscientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin\\r\\npeeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\\r\\nspout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I\\r\\nhave heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is\\r\\nfairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing\\r\\nthe investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly\\r\\nspout alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My\\r\\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides\\r\\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\\r\\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\\r\\nI account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an\\r\\nundisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;\\r\\nall other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.\\r\\nAnd I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound\\r\\nbeings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,\\r\\nthere always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act\\r\\nof thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on\\r\\nEternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere\\r\\nlong saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation\\r\\nin the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,\\r\\nwhile plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin\\r\\nshingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument\\r\\nfor the above supposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\\r\\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,\\r\\nmild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his\\r\\nincommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes\\r\\nsee it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal\\r\\nupon his thoughts.  For, d\\'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear\\r\\nair; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists\\r\\nof the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,\\r\\nenkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for\\r\\nall have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with\\r\\nthem, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions\\r\\nof some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor\\r\\ninfidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 86\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\\r\\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\\r\\ncelestial, I celebrate a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale\\'s tail to begin at that point\\r\\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\\r\\ncomprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\\r\\nsquare feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\\r\\nbroad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\\r\\nthan an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\\r\\nslightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\\r\\nleaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of\\r\\nbeauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\\r\\nthese flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\\r\\ntail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\\r\\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\\r\\nmiddle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\\r\\nlong and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\\r\\ncrosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\\r\\nas anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\\r\\nRoman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\\r\\nthin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\\r\\nwonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\\r\\nmuch to the great strength of the masonry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\\r\\nenough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\\r\\nwoof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\\r\\nthe loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\\r\\nthem, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\\r\\nconfluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to\\r\\na point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\\r\\ndo it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\\r\\ngraceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease\\r\\nundulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those\\r\\nmotions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength\\r\\nnever impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in\\r\\neverything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the\\r\\nmagic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from\\r\\nthe marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As\\r\\ndevout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of\\r\\nGoethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that\\r\\nseemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the\\r\\nFather in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever\\r\\nthey may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\\r\\nhermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\\r\\nsuccessfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of\\r\\nall brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,\\r\\nfeminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is\\r\\nconceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\\r\\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\\r\\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.\\r\\nTherein no fairy\\'s arm can transcend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for\\r\\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in\\r\\nsweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan\\'s tail acts in\\r\\na different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\\r\\nnever wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\\r\\nTo the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\\r\\ncoiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\\r\\nit is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\\r\\nmonster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\\r\\nby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\\r\\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\\r\\nhis conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\\r\\nIn striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\\r\\nthe blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\\r\\nunobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\\r\\nthen simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\\r\\nYour only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\\r\\nthrough the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\\r\\nof the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\\r\\nrib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\\r\\ngenerally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\\r\\noften received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child\\'s\\r\\nplay.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\\r\\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\\r\\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\\r\\nelephant\\'s trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\\r\\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\\r\\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\\r\\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor\\'s whisker, woe to that sailor,\\r\\nwhiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\\r\\ntouch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\\r\\nbethink me of Darmonodes\\' elephant that so frequented the\\r\\nflower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\\r\\ndamsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\\r\\npity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\\r\\nhis tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\\r\\nin the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\\r\\nthe middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\\r\\ncorpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\\r\\nif it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\\r\\nbroad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\\r\\nthe surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\\r\\nalmost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\\r\\nlight wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\\r\\nwould think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\\r\\nflukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\\r\\ncompletely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\\r\\nplunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\\r\\nhis body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\\r\\nmoment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime\\r\\nBREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale\\'s\\r\\nflukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\\r\\nnature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\\r\\nspasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I\\r\\nseen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\\r\\nthe flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in\\r\\nall what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to\\r\\nyou; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head\\r\\nof my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\\r\\nlarge herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\\r\\nfor a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\\r\\nto me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\\r\\nwas never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\\r\\nAs Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\\r\\ntestified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\\r\\nbeings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\\r\\nantiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\\r\\nprofoundest silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\\r\\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\\r\\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\\r\\nopposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\\r\\nrespectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\\r\\nto Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan\\'s tail, his trunk is but\\r\\nthe stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant\\'s trunk\\r\\nwere as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush\\r\\nand crash of the sperm whale\\'s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\\r\\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\\r\\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses\\r\\nhis balls.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale\\r\\nand the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\\r\\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\\r\\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\\r\\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that\\r\\nthe elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\\r\\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\\r\\ninability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,\\r\\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\\r\\ninexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\\r\\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared\\r\\nthem akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by\\r\\nthese methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there\\r\\nwanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of\\r\\nstrangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.\\r\\nDissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,\\r\\nand never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how\\r\\nunderstand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he\\r\\nhas none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,\\r\\nbut my face shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his\\r\\nback parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has\\r\\nno face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 87\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Armada.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward\\r\\nfrom the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all\\r\\nAsia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long\\r\\nislands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,\\r\\nform a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with\\r\\nAustralia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the\\r\\nthickly studded oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by\\r\\nseveral sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;\\r\\nconspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the\\r\\nstraits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,\\r\\nemerge into the China seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\\r\\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\\r\\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little\\r\\ncorrespond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled\\r\\nempire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and\\r\\nsilks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand\\r\\nislands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant\\r\\nprovision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of\\r\\nthe land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,\\r\\nof being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores of\\r\\nthe Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses\\r\\nwhich guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the\\r\\nPropontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the\\r\\nobsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of\\r\\nships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day,\\r\\nhave passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with\\r\\nthe costliest cargoes of the east.  But while they freely waive a\\r\\nceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to\\r\\nmore solid tribute.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\\r\\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\\r\\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at\\r\\nthe point of their spears.  Though by the repeated bloody\\r\\nchastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,\\r\\nthe audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;\\r\\nyet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and\\r\\nAmerican vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly\\r\\nboarded and pillaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\\r\\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\\r\\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\\r\\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine\\r\\nIslands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great\\r\\nwhaling season there.  By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod\\r\\nwould sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the\\r\\nworld, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where\\r\\nAhab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted\\r\\nupon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to\\r\\nfrequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed\\r\\nto be haunting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\\r\\ncrew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a long\\r\\ntime, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring,\\r\\nand needs no sustenance but what\\'s in himself.  So Ahab.  Mark this,\\r\\ntoo, in the whaler.  While other hulls are loaded down with alien\\r\\nstuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering\\r\\nwhale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and\\r\\ntheir wants.  She has a whole lake\\'s contents bottled in her ample\\r\\nhold.  She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable\\r\\npig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years\\' water in her.  Clear old\\r\\nprime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the\\r\\nNantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish\\r\\nfluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian\\r\\nstreams.  Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China\\r\\nfrom New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the\\r\\nwhale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of\\r\\nsoil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like\\r\\nthemselves.  So that did you carry them the news that another flood\\r\\nhad come; they would only answer--\"Well, boys, here\\'s the ark!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\\r\\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most\\r\\nof the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen\\r\\nas an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained\\r\\nmore and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,\\r\\nand admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the green palmy cliffs\\r\\nof the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted\\r\\nnostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single\\r\\njet was descried.  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with\\r\\nany game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when\\r\\nthe customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a\\r\\nspectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\\r\\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\\r\\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\\r\\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in\\r\\nextensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it\\r\\nwould almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn\\r\\nleague and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To this\\r\\naggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be\\r\\nimputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you\\r\\nmay now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being\\r\\ngreeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what\\r\\nsometimes seems thousands on thousands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\\r\\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,\\r\\na continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\\r\\nnoon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the\\r\\nRight Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like\\r\\nthe cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting\\r\\nspout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,\\r\\ncontinually rising and falling away to leeward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeen from the Pequod\\'s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill\\r\\nof the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into\\r\\nthe air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,\\r\\nshowed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,\\r\\ndescried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\\r\\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage\\r\\nin their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the\\r\\nplain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying\\r\\nforward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their\\r\\nsemicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic\\r\\ncentre.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\\r\\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their\\r\\nyet suspended boats.  If the wind only held, little doubt had they,\\r\\nthat chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only\\r\\ndeploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of\\r\\ntheir number.  And who could tell whether, in that congregated\\r\\ncaravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like\\r\\nthe worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the\\r\\nSiamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,\\r\\ndriving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of\\r\\nTashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our\\r\\nwake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\\r\\nrear.  It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling\\r\\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\\r\\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\\r\\ndisappearing.  Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly\\r\\nrevolved in his pivot-hole, crying, \"Aloft there, and rig whips and\\r\\nbuckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\\r\\nfairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in\\r\\nhot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the\\r\\nswift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;\\r\\nhow very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding\\r\\nher on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to\\r\\nher, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\\r\\nthe deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and\\r\\nin the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\\r\\nfancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green\\r\\nwalls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and\\r\\nbethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,\\r\\nand beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing\\r\\nand being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of\\r\\nremorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were\\r\\ninfernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these\\r\\nconceits had passed through his brain, Ahab\\'s brow was left gaunt and\\r\\nribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been\\r\\ngnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\\r\\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\\r\\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\\r\\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\\r\\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\\r\\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\\r\\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the\\r\\nwake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;\\r\\ngradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was\\r\\npassed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some\\r\\npresumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\\r\\nthe three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\\r\\nrear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\\r\\nbattalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\\r\\nstacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\\r\\nafter several hours\\' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\\r\\nchase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave\\r\\nanimating token that they were now at last under the influence of\\r\\nthat strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\\r\\nfishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\\r\\ncompact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\\r\\nsteadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\\r\\nlike King Porus\\' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\\r\\nseemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\\r\\nvast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\\r\\ntheir short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\\r\\nof panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\\r\\nnumber, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\\r\\nwater-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\\r\\nbut a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\\r\\nwolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\\r\\nBut this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\\r\\ncreatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\\r\\nlion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\\r\\nhorseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\\r\\nin the sheepfold of a theatre\\'s pit, they will, at the slightest\\r\\nalarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\\r\\ntrampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\\r\\nBest, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\\r\\nwhales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth\\r\\nwhich is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\\r\\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\\r\\nnor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\\r\\ncustomary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\\r\\nfor some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\\r\\nthree minutes\\' time, Queequeg\\'s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\\r\\ndarted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\\r\\nlight, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\\r\\nmovement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\\r\\nin no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\\r\\nanticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\\r\\nvicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\\r\\ndeeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\\r\\ncircumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\\r\\nof speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\\r\\nas we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\\r\\nflew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\\r\\nboat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\\r\\nto steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\\r\\nwhat moment it may be locked in and crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\\r\\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\\r\\naway from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\\r\\nall the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\\r\\nout of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\\r\\nthere was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\\r\\nidle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\\r\\nThey chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\\r\\nthe way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\\r\\nrose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\\r\\nus.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\\r\\nwhich, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\\r\\nown fan-like extremity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\\r\\ninvented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\\r\\nof wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\\r\\ncross each other\\'s grain at right angles; a line of considerable\\r\\nlength is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\\r\\nend of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\\r\\nharpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\\r\\nFor then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\\r\\nchase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\\r\\nwhile you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\\r\\nkill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\\r\\nafterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\\r\\nthese the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\\r\\nthree of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\\r\\nsaw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\\r\\nsidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\\r\\nmalefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\\r\\nthe act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\\r\\none of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\\r\\ncarried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat\\'s bottom as the\\r\\nseat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\\r\\nwounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\\r\\nand so stopped the leaks for the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\\r\\nit not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale\\'s way greatly\\r\\ndiminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\\r\\nthe circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\\r\\nSo that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\\r\\nwhale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\\r\\nmomentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\\r\\nthe shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\\r\\nvalley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\\r\\noutermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\\r\\nthe sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\\r\\nproduced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\\r\\nquiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\\r\\nlurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\\r\\ndistance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\\r\\nsaw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\\r\\nround and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\\r\\nclosely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\\r\\neasily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\\r\\ntheir backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\\r\\nmore immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\\r\\npossible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\\r\\nfor a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\\r\\nonly admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\\r\\nthe lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\\r\\nthe women and children of this routed host.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\\r\\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\\r\\nin any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\\r\\nembraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\\r\\nthree square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\\r\\ntime might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\\r\\nboat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\\r\\nmention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\\r\\nbeen purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\\r\\nextent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\\r\\nprecise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\\r\\nunsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\\r\\nmay have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\\r\\nbecalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\\r\\nfearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\\r\\nwas impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\\r\\nsnuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\\r\\nit almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\\r\\nQueequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\\r\\nhis lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\\r\\nfrom darting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\\r\\nstill stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\\r\\nsuspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\\r\\nmothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\\r\\nshortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\\r\\nconsiderable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\\r\\nwhile suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\\r\\nif leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\\r\\nmortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\\r\\nreminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\\r\\ntowards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in\\r\\ntheir new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also\\r\\nseemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from\\r\\ncertain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured\\r\\nsome fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a\\r\\nlittle frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\\r\\nfrom that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\\r\\nreticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,\\r\\nthe unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar\\'s bow.  The delicate\\r\\nside-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\\r\\nplaited crumpled appearance of a baby\\'s ears newly arrived from\\r\\nforeign parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!\\r\\nhim fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one\\r\\nlittle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\\r\\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\\r\\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\\r\\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical\\r\\ncord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still\\r\\ntethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\\r\\nchase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes\\r\\nentangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.\\r\\nSome of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in\\r\\nthis enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\\r\\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\\r\\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing\\r\\nbut one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to\\r\\nan Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two\\r\\nteats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the\\r\\nbreasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these\\r\\nprecious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter\\'s lance, the\\r\\nmother\\'s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for\\r\\nrods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it\\r\\nmight do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual\\r\\nesteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations\\r\\nand affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely\\r\\nand fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely\\r\\nrevelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed\\r\\nAtlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in\\r\\nmute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round\\r\\nme, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal\\r\\nmildness of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\\r\\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\\r\\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\\r\\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\\r\\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the\\r\\nsight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to\\r\\nand fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.\\r\\nIt is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly\\r\\npowerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by\\r\\nsundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting\\r\\na short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for\\r\\nhauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in\\r\\nthis part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from\\r\\nthe boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in\\r\\nthe extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the\\r\\nrevolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\\r\\nbattle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\\r\\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he\\r\\nseemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at\\r\\nfirst the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we\\r\\nperceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,\\r\\nthis whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he\\r\\nhad also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free\\r\\nend of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in\\r\\nthe coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade\\r\\nitself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to\\r\\nmadness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing\\r\\nwith his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\\r\\nwounding and murdering his own comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\\r\\nstationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\\r\\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted\\r\\nby half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly\\r\\nto heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries\\r\\nvanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more\\r\\ncentral circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long\\r\\ncalm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then\\r\\nlike to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river\\r\\nHudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling\\r\\nupon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common\\r\\nmountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck\\r\\ntaking the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oars!  Oars!\" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--\"gripe your\\r\\noars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!  Shove him\\r\\noff, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand\\r\\nup--stand up, and stay so!  Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their\\r\\nbacks--scrape them!--scrape away!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving\\r\\na narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.  But by desperate\\r\\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\\r\\nrapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\\r\\nAfter many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided\\r\\ninto what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by\\r\\nrandom whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky\\r\\nsalvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg\\'s hat, who,\\r\\nwhile standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat\\r\\ntaken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing\\r\\nof a pair of broad flukes close by.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\\r\\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\\r\\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\\r\\nonward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;\\r\\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\\r\\nwhales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which\\r\\nFlask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or\\r\\nthree of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional\\r\\ngame is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a\\r\\ndead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of\\r\\nprior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that\\r\\nsagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.  Of\\r\\nall the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to\\r\\nescape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,\\r\\nby some other craft than the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 88\\r\\n\\r\\nSchools and Schoolmasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\\r\\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing\\r\\nthose vast aggregations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\\r\\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\\r\\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals\\r\\neach.  Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two\\r\\nsorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering\\r\\nnone but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly\\r\\ndesignated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see\\r\\na male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,\\r\\nevinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight\\r\\nof his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,\\r\\nswimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by\\r\\nall the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between\\r\\nthis Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is\\r\\nalways of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at\\r\\nfull growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an\\r\\naverage-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare\\r\\nsay, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nit cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily\\r\\nentitled to EMBONPOINT.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\r\\nramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\\r\\nleisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the Line in time for\\r\\nthe full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just\\r\\nreturned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and\\r\\nso cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the\\r\\ntime they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator\\r\\nawhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the\\r\\ncool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of\\r\\nthe year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\\r\\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\r\\ninteresting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\\r\\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\\r\\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\\r\\nhim away!  High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him\\r\\nare to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though\\r\\ndo what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario\\r\\nout of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common.  As ashore, the\\r\\nladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival\\r\\nadmirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly\\r\\nbattle, and all for love.  They fence with their long lower jaws,\\r\\nsometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy\\r\\nlike elks that warringly interweave their antlers.  Not a few are\\r\\ncaptured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed heads,\\r\\nbroken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and\\r\\ndislocated mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\\r\\nthe first rush of the harem\\'s lord, then is it very diverting to\\r\\nwatch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again\\r\\nand revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young\\r\\nLothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand\\r\\nconcubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen\\r\\nwill seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand\\r\\nTurks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness\\r\\nis small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons\\r\\nand daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the\\r\\nmaternal help.  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that\\r\\nmight be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however\\r\\nmuch for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his\\r\\nanonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.  In good\\r\\ntime, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and\\r\\ndumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a\\r\\ngeneral lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and\\r\\nvirtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the\\r\\nimpotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands\\r\\nthe harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all\\r\\nalone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and\\r\\nwarning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so\\r\\nis the lord and master of that school technically known as the\\r\\nschoolmaster.  It is therefore not in strict character, however\\r\\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should\\r\\nthen go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly\\r\\nof it.  His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived\\r\\nfrom the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised\\r\\nthat the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must\\r\\nhave read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\\r\\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,\\r\\nand what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into\\r\\nsome of his pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\\r\\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\\r\\nWhales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is\\r\\ncalled--proves an ancient one.  Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel\\r\\nBoone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he\\r\\ntakes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she\\r\\nis, though she keeps so many moody secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\\r\\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.  For while\\r\\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\\r\\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\\r\\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\\r\\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\\r\\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal\\r\\ngout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.\\r\\nLike a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and\\r\\nwickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking\\r\\nrate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he\\r\\nwould a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon relinquish this\\r\\nturbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and\\r\\nseparately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is\\r\\nstill more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike a\\r\\nForty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.  But strike\\r\\na member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\\r\\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long,\\r\\nas themselves to fall a prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 89\\r\\n\\r\\nFast-Fish and Loose-Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\\r\\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\\r\\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in\\r\\ncompany, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be\\r\\nfinally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are\\r\\nindirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this\\r\\none grand feature.  For example,--after a weary and perilous chase\\r\\nand capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by\\r\\nreason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be\\r\\nretaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside,\\r\\nwithout risk of life or line.  Thus the most vexatious and violent\\r\\ndisputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some\\r\\nwritten or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all\\r\\ncases.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\\r\\nenactment, was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General\\r\\nin A.D. 1695.  But though no other nation has ever had any written\\r\\nwhaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own\\r\\nlegislators and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system\\r\\nwhich for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian\\'s Pandects and\\r\\nthe By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling\\r\\nwith other People\\'s Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven on a\\r\\nQueen Anne\\'s forthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the\\r\\nneck, so small are they.\\r\\n\\r\\nI.  A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\\r\\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\\r\\nexpound it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish?  Alive or dead a fish is technically\\r\\nfast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any\\r\\nmedium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an\\r\\noar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it\\r\\nis all the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a\\r\\nwaif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the\\r\\nparty waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it\\r\\nalongside, as well as their intention so to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the\\r\\nwhalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder\\r\\nknocks--the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more\\r\\nupright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for\\r\\npeculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for\\r\\none party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed\\r\\nby another party.  But others are by no means so scrupulous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover\\r\\nlitigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a\\r\\nhard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the\\r\\nplaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,\\r\\nthrough peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their\\r\\nlines, but their boat itself.  Ultimately the defendants (the crew of\\r\\nanother ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and\\r\\nfinally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And\\r\\nwhen those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped\\r\\nhis fingers in the plaintiffs\\' teeth, and assured them that by way of\\r\\ndoxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,\\r\\nharpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the\\r\\ntime of the seizure.  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the\\r\\nrecovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\\r\\njudge.  In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\\r\\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\\r\\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife\\'s\\r\\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\\r\\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action\\r\\nto recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he\\r\\nthen supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\\r\\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\\r\\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\\r\\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\\r\\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\\r\\nbecame that subsequent gentleman\\'s property, along with whatever\\r\\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\\r\\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the\\r\\nvery learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the\\r\\nboat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely\\r\\nabandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the\\r\\ncontroverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the\\r\\ndefendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the\\r\\nfinal capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made\\r\\noff with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;\\r\\nand hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.\\r\\nNow the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid\\r\\narticles were theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,\\r\\nmight possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of\\r\\nthe matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling\\r\\nlaws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord\\r\\nEllenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching\\r\\nFast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the\\r\\nfundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its\\r\\ncomplicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the\\r\\nTemple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not a saying in every one\\'s mouth, Possession is half of the\\r\\nlaw: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?  But\\r\\noften possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews and\\r\\nsouls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof\\r\\npossession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious landlord\\r\\nis the widow\\'s last mite but a Fast-Fish?  What is yonder undetected\\r\\nvillain\\'s marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that\\r\\nbut a Fast-Fish?  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the\\r\\nbroker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to\\r\\nkeep Woebegone\\'s family from starvation; what is that ruinous\\r\\ndiscount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Savesoul\\'s\\r\\nincome of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of\\r\\nhundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven\\r\\nwithout any of Savesoul\\'s help) what is that globular L100,000 but a\\r\\nFast-Fish?  What are the Duke of Dunder\\'s hereditary towns and\\r\\nhamlets but Fast-Fish?  What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull,\\r\\nis poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish?  What to that apostolic lancer,\\r\\nBrother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  And concerning all\\r\\nthese, is not Possession the whole of the law?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\\r\\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.  That is\\r\\ninternationally and universally applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck\\r\\nthe Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\\r\\nmistress?  What was Poland to the Czar?  What Greece to the Turk?\\r\\nWhat India to England?  What at last will Mexico be to the United\\r\\nStates?  All Loose-Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but\\r\\nLoose-Fish?  What all men\\'s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish?  What\\r\\nis the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?  What\\r\\nto the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers\\r\\nbut Loose-Fish?  What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish?\\r\\nAnd what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 90\\r\\n\\r\\nHeads or Tails.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.\"\\r\\nBRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with\\r\\nthe context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the\\r\\ncoast of that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have\\r\\nthe head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail.  A\\r\\ndivision which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is\\r\\nno intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,\\r\\nis to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various\\r\\nrespects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and\\r\\nLoose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same\\r\\ncourteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the\\r\\nexpense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation\\r\\nof royalty.  In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that\\r\\nthe above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before\\r\\nyou a circumstance that happened within the last two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\\r\\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\\r\\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off\\r\\nfrom the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under\\r\\nthe jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord\\r\\nWarden.  Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all\\r\\nthe royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become\\r\\nby assignment his.  By some writers this office is called a sinecure.\\r\\nBut not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in\\r\\nfobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same\\r\\nfobbing of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\\r\\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\\r\\nfat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the\\r\\nprecious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\\r\\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\\r\\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\\r\\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\\r\\nlaying it upon the whale\\'s head, he says--\"Hands off! this fish, my\\r\\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden\\'s.\"  Upon\\r\\nthis the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly\\r\\nEnglish--knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\\r\\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\\r\\nstranger.  But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften\\r\\nthe hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.\\r\\nAt length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,\\r\\nmade bold to speak,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Duke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is\\r\\nall that to go to the Duke\\'s benefit; we getting nothing at all for\\r\\nour pains but our blisters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\\r\\ngetting a livelihood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\\r\\nthis whale.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\\r\\nWellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some\\r\\nparticular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small\\r\\ndegree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an\\r\\nhonest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his\\r\\nGrace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners\\r\\ninto full consideration.  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied\\r\\n(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and\\r\\nreceived the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if\\r\\nfor the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling\\r\\nwith other people\\'s business.  Is this the still militant old man,\\r\\nstanding at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing\\r\\nalms of beggars?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the\\r\\nDuke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must\\r\\nneeds inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally\\r\\ninvested with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.\\r\\nBut Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so\\r\\ncaught belongs to the King and Queen, \"because of its superior\\r\\nexcellence.\"  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been\\r\\nheld a cogent argument in such matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?  A\\r\\nreason for that, ye lawyers!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his treatise on \"Queen-Gold,\" or Queen-pinmoney, an old King\\'s\\r\\nBench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \"Ye tail is ye\\r\\nQueen\\'s, that ye Queen\\'s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.\"\\r\\nNow this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the\\r\\nGreenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies\\' bodices.  But\\r\\nthis same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad\\r\\nmistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.  But is the Queen a\\r\\nmermaid, to be presented with a tail?  An allegorical meaning may\\r\\nlurk here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the\\r\\nwhale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain\\r\\nlimitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown\\'s\\r\\nordinary revenue.  I know not that any other author has hinted of the\\r\\nmatter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be\\r\\ndivided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly\\r\\ndense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically\\r\\nregarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed\\r\\ncongeniality.  And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in\\r\\nlaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 91\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\\r\\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\"\\r\\nSIR T. BROWNE, V.E.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\\r\\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the\\r\\nmany noses on the Pequod\\'s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\\r\\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft.  A peculiar and not very pleasant\\r\\nsmell was smelt in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will bet something now,\" said Stubb, \"that somewhere hereabouts\\r\\nare some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.  I thought\\r\\nthey would keel up before long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the\\r\\ndistance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of\\r\\nwhale must be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed\\r\\nFrench colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture\\r\\nsea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was\\r\\nplain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a\\r\\nblasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,\\r\\nand so floated an unappropriated corpse.  It may well be conceived,\\r\\nwhat an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian\\r\\ncity in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the\\r\\ndeparted.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no\\r\\ncupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there\\r\\nthose who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\\r\\nobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no\\r\\nmeans of the nature of attar-of-rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the\\r\\nFrenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed\\r\\neven more of a nosegay than the first.  In truth, it turned out to be\\r\\none of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a\\r\\nsort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct\\r\\nbodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nin the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever\\r\\nturn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun\\r\\nblasted whales in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\\r\\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\\r\\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a pretty fellow, now,\" he banteringly laughed, standing in\\r\\nthe ship\\'s bows, \"there\\'s a jackal for ye!  I well know that these\\r\\nCrappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes\\r\\nlowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale\\r\\nspouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold\\r\\nfull of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing\\r\\nthat all the oil they will get won\\'t be enough to dip the Captain\\'s\\r\\nwick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here\\'s a\\r\\nCrappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I\\r\\nmean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that\\r\\nother precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a\\r\\nhat, some one, and let\\'s make him a present of a little oil for dear\\r\\ncharity\\'s sake.  For what oil he\\'ll get from that drugged whale\\r\\nthere, wouldn\\'t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned\\r\\ncell.  And as for the other whale, why, I\\'ll agree to get more oil by\\r\\nchopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he\\'ll get\\r\\nfrom that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may\\r\\ncontain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I\\r\\nwonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It\\'s worth trying.\\r\\nYes, I\\'m for it;\" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that\\r\\nwhether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with\\r\\nno hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from\\r\\nthe cabin, Stubb now called his boat\\'s crew, and pulled off for the\\r\\nstranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance\\r\\nwith the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was\\r\\ncarved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,\\r\\nand for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;\\r\\nthe whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red\\r\\ncolour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton\\r\\nde Rose,\"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name\\r\\nof this aromatic ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,\\r\\nyet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\\r\\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A wooden rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that\\r\\nwill do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\\r\\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\\r\\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\\r\\nbawled--\"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses\\r\\nthat speak English?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to\\r\\nbe the chief-mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WHAT whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, then; good bye now, and I\\'ll call again in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\\r\\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\\r\\nhands into a trumpet and shouted--\"No, Sir!  No!\"  Upon which Ahab\\r\\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\\r\\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort\\r\\nof bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with your nose, there?\" said Stubb.  \"Broke it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it was broken, or that I didn\\'t have any nose at all!\"\\r\\nanswered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was\\r\\nat very much.  \"But what are you holding YOURS for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing!  It\\'s a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,\\r\\nain\\'t it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of\\r\\nposies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What in the devil\\'s name do you want here?\" roared the Guernseyman,\\r\\nflying into a sudden passion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that\\'s the word! why don\\'t you pack those\\r\\nwhales in ice while you\\'re working at \\'em?  But joking aside, though;\\r\\ndo you know, Rose-bud, that it\\'s all nonsense trying to get any oil\\r\\nout of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn\\'t a\\r\\ngill in his whole carcase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that well enough; but, d\\'ye see, the Captain here won\\'t\\r\\nbelieve it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\\r\\nbefore.  But come aboard, and mayhap he\\'ll believe you, if he won\\'t\\r\\nme; and so I\\'ll get out of this dirty scrape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined\\r\\nStubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer\\r\\nscene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red\\r\\nworsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.\\r\\nBut they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in\\r\\nanything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from\\r\\ntheir faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would\\r\\ndrop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\\r\\nSome thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,\\r\\nand at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the\\r\\nstems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\\r\\npuffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\\r\\nolfactories.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\\r\\nfrom the Captain\\'s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\\r\\nsaw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar\\r\\nfrom within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\\r\\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\\r\\nto the Captain\\'s round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the\\r\\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\\r\\nindignations at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\\r\\nthe Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\\r\\nstranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\\r\\nignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\\r\\na pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\\r\\nGuernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\\r\\nambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\\r\\nwas quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\\r\\nconcocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\\r\\nCaptain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\\r\\nAccording to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\\r\\ncover of an interpreter\\'s office, was to tell the Captain what he\\r\\npleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter\\r\\nany nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a\\r\\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\\r\\nwith large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\\r\\nvelvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\\r\\nwas now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\\r\\nostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\\r\\n\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\\r\\nto me, though I don\\'t pretend to be a judge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\\r\\ncaptain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\\r\\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from\\r\\na blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\\r\\ncarefully, I\\'m quite certain that he\\'s no more fit to command a\\r\\nwhale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he\\'s a\\r\\nbaboon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\\r\\nis far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\\r\\nconjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\\r\\ncrew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\\r\\nloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\\r\\nfact, tell him I\\'ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\\r\\nsomebody else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur, that he\\'s very happy to have been of any service\\r\\nto us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\\r\\n(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down\\r\\ninto his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the\\r\\ninterpreter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it\\'s against my principles to drink\\r\\nwith the man I\\'ve diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won\\'t admit of his drinking;\\r\\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\\r\\nMonsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\\r\\nthese whales, for it\\'s so calm they won\\'t drift.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\\r\\nhailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line\\r\\nin his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\\r\\nthe lighter whale of the two from the ship\\'s side.  While the\\r\\nFrenchman\\'s boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\\r\\nStubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\\r\\nostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\\r\\nwhale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\\r\\nwhile the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb\\'s whale.  Whereupon\\r\\nStubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\\r\\ngive notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\\r\\nhis unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\\r\\nan excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\\r\\nalmost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\\r\\nwhen at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\\r\\nturning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\\r\\nHis boat\\'s crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\\r\\nchief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\\r\\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\\r\\nbeginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\\r\\nincreased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\\r\\nthere stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\\r\\nof bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\\r\\ninto and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\\r\\na time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\\r\\nin the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\\r\\nsomething that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\\r\\ncheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\\r\\nwith your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\\r\\nthis, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\\r\\ndruggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\\r\\nlost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\\r\\nwere it not for impatient Ahab\\'s loud command to Stubb to desist, and\\r\\ncome on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 92\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbergris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\\r\\nan article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\\r\\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\\r\\nthat subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\\r\\nlate day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\\r\\nitself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\\r\\nthe French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\\r\\ndistinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\\r\\ndug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\\r\\nexcept upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\\r\\nodorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\\r\\nornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\\r\\nspicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\\r\\ncandles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\\r\\nalso carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\\r\\ncarried to St. Peter\\'s in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\\r\\ngrains into claret, to flavor it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\\r\\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\\r\\nsick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\\r\\ncause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\\r\\nto cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\\r\\nthree or four boat loads of Brandreth\\'s pills, and then running out\\r\\nof harm\\'s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\\r\\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\\r\\nbe sailors\\' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\\r\\nwere nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\\r\\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\\r\\nthat saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\\r\\nincorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\\r\\nAnd likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\\r\\nthat maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of\\r\\nall things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\\r\\nmanufacturing stages, is the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\\r\\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\\r\\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\\r\\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\\r\\nof the Frenchman\\'s two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\\r\\nslanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\\r\\nis throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\\r\\nthing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\\r\\ndid this odious stigma originate?\\r\\n\\r\\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\r\\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\\r\\nBecause those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\\r\\noil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\\r\\nfresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\\r\\nlarge casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\\r\\nseason in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\\r\\nthey are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\\r\\nthat upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\\r\\ncemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\\r\\nsimilar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\\r\\nthe foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\\r\\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\\r\\nformer times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\\r\\nwhich latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\\r\\nhis great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\\r\\nimports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\\r\\norder to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\\r\\nbe tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\\r\\nIt was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\\r\\nthe works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\\r\\npleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\\r\\nSperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\\r\\ncompletely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\\r\\nfifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\\r\\nis casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\\r\\ndead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\\r\\ncreatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\\r\\nof the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\\r\\nnose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\\r\\nwhen, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\\r\\nabundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\\r\\nseldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale\\'s\\r\\nflukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\\r\\nrustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\\r\\nSperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\\r\\nbe to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\\r\\nmyrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander\\r\\nthe Great?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 93\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Castaway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a\\r\\nmost significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod\\'s\\r\\ncrew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the\\r\\nsometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever\\r\\naccompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her\\r\\nown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.\\r\\nSome few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is\\r\\nto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.  As a\\r\\ngeneral thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men\\r\\ncomprising the boats\\' crews.  But if there happen to be an unduly\\r\\nslender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain\\r\\nto be made a ship-keeper.  It was so in the Pequod with the little\\r\\nnegro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye have\\r\\nheard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic\\r\\nmidnight, so gloomy-jolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony\\r\\nand a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour,\\r\\ndriven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by\\r\\nnature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over\\r\\ntender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,\\r\\ngenial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever\\r\\nenjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any\\r\\nother race.  For blacks, the year\\'s calendar should show naught but\\r\\nthree hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year\\'s Days.\\r\\nNor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for\\r\\neven blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\\r\\npanelled in king\\'s cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life\\'s\\r\\npeaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\\r\\nhad somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\\r\\nhis brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\\r\\ntemporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\\r\\nillumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\\r\\nten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\\r\\nin Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler\\'s frolic on the\\r\\ngreen; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the\\r\\nround horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the\\r\\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\\r\\npure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\\r\\njeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\\r\\nlays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\\r\\nsun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery\\r\\neffulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\\r\\nthe divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\\r\\nstolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\\'s after-oarsman\\r\\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\\r\\nand, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\\r\\nbut happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\\r\\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\\r\\nobserving him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\\r\\ncourageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\\r\\nthe fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\\r\\nhappened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip\\'s seat.  The\\r\\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\\r\\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\\r\\nwhale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\\r\\nhim, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\\r\\nwater.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\\r\\nline swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\\r\\nto the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\\r\\nwhich had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\\r\\nhated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\\r\\nhe suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\\r\\nexclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip\\'s blue, choked face\\r\\nplainly looked, Do, for God\\'s sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\\r\\nthan half a minute, this entire thing happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\\r\\nsaved.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\\r\\nby yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\\r\\nirregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\\r\\nbusiness-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\\r\\nand that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\\r\\nsubstance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\\r\\nwas indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\\r\\nSTICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\\r\\nsometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\\r\\nas if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\\r\\nconscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\\r\\nmargin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\\r\\nand concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\\r\\nby the Lord, I won\\'t pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can\\'t\\r\\nafford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\\r\\nthirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\\r\\ndon\\'t jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\\r\\nthough man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\\r\\npropensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\\r\\nwas under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\\r\\nthis time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\\r\\nstarted to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\\r\\ntraveller\\'s trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\\r\\nwas a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\\r\\ncool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\\r\\ngold-beater\\'s skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\\r\\ndown in that sea, Pip\\'s ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\\r\\nboat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb\\'s\\r\\ninexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\\r\\nthree minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\\r\\nStubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\\r\\ncurling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\\r\\nloftiest and the brightest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\r\\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\\r\\nawful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\\r\\nin the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\\r\\nMark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\\r\\nhow closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\\r\\nNo; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in\\r\\nhis wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come\\r\\nup to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\\r\\nconsiderations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\\r\\ntimidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\\r\\ninstances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\\r\\ninvariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\\r\\nsame ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\\r\\nspying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\\r\\nStubb\\'s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\\r\\nupon his fish, that Pip\\'s ringed horizon began to expand around him\\r\\nmiserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\\r\\nbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;\\r\\nsuch, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his\\r\\nfinite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned\\r\\nentirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,\\r\\nwhere strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro\\r\\nbefore his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\\r\\nhoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile\\r\\neternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral\\r\\ninsects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal\\r\\norbs.  He saw God\\'s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;\\r\\nand therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man\\'s insanity is\\r\\nheaven\\'s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at\\r\\nlast to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and\\r\\nfrantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as\\r\\nhis God.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common in\\r\\nthat fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be\\r\\nseen what like abandonment befell myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 94\\r\\n\\r\\nA Squeeze of the Hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat whale of Stubb\\'s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\\r\\nPequod\\'s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\\r\\npreviously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling\\r\\nof the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed\\r\\nin dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;\\r\\nand when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully\\r\\nmanipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\\r\\nseveral others, I sat down before a large Constantine\\'s bath of it, I\\r\\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about\\r\\nin the liquid part.  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back\\r\\ninto fluid.  A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times\\r\\nthis sperm was such a favourite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such a\\r\\nsweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier!  After\\r\\nhaving my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like\\r\\neels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\\r\\nexertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\\r\\nindolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands\\r\\namong those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven\\r\\nalmost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and\\r\\ndischarged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as\\r\\nI snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like\\r\\nthe smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I\\r\\nlived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in\\r\\nthat inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I\\r\\nalmost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is\\r\\nof rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that\\r\\nbath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or\\r\\nmalice, of any sort whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that\\r\\nsperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till\\r\\na strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself\\r\\nunwittingly squeezing my co-laborers\\' hands in it, mistaking their\\r\\nhands for the gentle globules.  Such an abounding, affectionate,\\r\\nfriendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was\\r\\ncontinually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes\\r\\nsentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why\\r\\nshould we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest\\r\\nill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us\\r\\nall squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves\\r\\nuniversally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!  For now,\\r\\nsince by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that\\r\\nin all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his\\r\\nconceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the\\r\\nintellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the\\r\\ntable, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have\\r\\nperceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In\\r\\nthoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in\\r\\nparadise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\\r\\nakin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\\r\\ntry-works.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the\\r\\ntapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his\\r\\nflukes.  It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but\\r\\nstill contains some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the\\r\\nwhite-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the\\r\\nmincer.  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of\\r\\nthe whale\\'s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,\\r\\nand often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.\\r\\nIt is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.  As\\r\\nits name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a\\r\\nbestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest\\r\\ncrimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.\\r\\nSpite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.  I\\r\\nconfess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.  It tasted\\r\\nsomething as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis\\r\\nle Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the\\r\\nfirst day after the venison season, and that particular venison\\r\\nseason contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards\\r\\nof Champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up\\r\\nin the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very\\r\\npuzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion; an\\r\\nappellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of\\r\\nthe substance.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most\\r\\nfrequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,\\r\\nand subsequent decanting.  I hold it to be the wondrously thin,\\r\\nruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\\r\\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.  It designates\\r\\nthe dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\\r\\nGreenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those\\r\\ninferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\\'s\\r\\nvocabulary.  But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman\\'s\\r\\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\\r\\npart of Leviathan\\'s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for\\r\\nthe rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.  Edgewise\\r\\nmoved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and\\r\\nby nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all\\r\\nimpurities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\\r\\nonce to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its\\r\\ninmates.  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle\\r\\nfor the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.  When\\r\\nthe proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment\\r\\nis a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,\\r\\nlit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.\\r\\nThey generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.\\r\\nThe whaling-pike is similar to a frigate\\'s boarding-weapon of the\\r\\nsame name.  The gaff is something like a boat-hook.  With his gaff,\\r\\nthe gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it\\r\\nfrom slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the\\r\\nspade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it\\r\\ninto the portable horse-pieces.  This spade is sharp as hone can make\\r\\nit; the spademan\\'s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will\\r\\nsometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he\\r\\ncuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants\\', would you be\\r\\nvery much astonished?  Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 95\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cassock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\\r\\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\\r\\nwindlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\\r\\ncuriosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have\\r\\nseen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.  Not the\\r\\nwondrous cistern in the whale\\'s huge head; not the prodigy of his\\r\\nunhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of\\r\\nthese would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable\\r\\ncone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at\\r\\nthe base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an\\r\\nidol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.\\r\\nSuch an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in\\r\\nJudea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,\\r\\nand destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook\\r\\nKedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of\\r\\nKings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and\\r\\nassisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the\\r\\nmariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as\\r\\nif he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.\\r\\nExtending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically\\r\\nto remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.\\r\\nThis done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives\\r\\nit a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at\\r\\nlast hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.  Ere long, it is\\r\\ntaken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed\\r\\nextremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,\\r\\nhe lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands\\r\\nbefore you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.\\r\\nImmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately\\r\\nprotect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\\r\\npots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,\\r\\nplanted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub\\r\\nbeneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets\\r\\nfrom a rapt orator\\'s desk.  Arrayed in decent black; occupying a\\r\\nconspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an\\r\\narchbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry from the\\r\\nmates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work\\r\\ninto as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business\\r\\nof boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity\\r\\nconsiderably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 96\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Try-Works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\\r\\ndistinguished by her try-works.  She presents the curious anomaly of\\r\\nthe most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\\r\\ncompleted ship.  It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\\r\\ntransported to her planks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the\\r\\nmost roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar\\r\\nstrength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of\\r\\nbrick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height.\\r\\nThe foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\\r\\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\\r\\nsides, and screwing it down to the timbers.  On the flanks it is\\r\\ncased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping,\\r\\nbattened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,\\r\\ntwo in number, and each of several barrels\\' capacity.  When not in\\r\\nuse, they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished\\r\\nwith soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver\\r\\npunch-bowls.  During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will\\r\\ncrawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.  While\\r\\nemployed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--many\\r\\nconfidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.  It\\r\\nis a place also for profound mathematical meditation.  It was in the\\r\\nleft hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently\\r\\ncircling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the\\r\\nremarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the\\r\\ncycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in\\r\\nprecisely the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\\r\\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\\r\\nthe furnaces, directly underneath the pots.  These mouths are fitted\\r\\nwith heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented\\r\\nfrom communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow\\r\\nreservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works.\\r\\nBy a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished\\r\\nwith water as fast as it evaporates.  There are no external chimneys;\\r\\nthey open direct from the rear wall.  And here let us go back for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about nine o\\'clock at night that the Pequod\\'s try-works were\\r\\nfirst started on this present voyage.  It belonged to Stubb to\\r\\noversee the business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook, fire\\r\\nthe works.\"  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been\\r\\nthrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.  Here\\r\\nbe it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has\\r\\nto be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood is used, except\\r\\nas a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.  In a word, after\\r\\nbeing tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or\\r\\nfritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.\\r\\nThese fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or\\r\\na self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his\\r\\nown fuel and burns by his own body.  Would that he consumed his own\\r\\nsmoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must,\\r\\nand not only that, but you must live in it for the time.  It has an\\r\\nunspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the\\r\\nvicinity of funereal pyres.  It smells like the left wing of the day\\r\\nof judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midnight the works were in full operation.  We were clear from the\\r\\ncarcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\\r\\ndarkness was intense.  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\\r\\nflames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\\r\\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\\r\\nfire.  The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\\r\\nsome vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\\r\\nbold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with\\r\\nbroad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates,\\r\\nand folded them in conflagrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\\r\\nhearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes\\r\\nof the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship\\'s stokers.  With huge\\r\\npronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the\\r\\nscalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames\\r\\ndarted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.  The\\r\\nsmoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship there\\r\\nwas a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap\\r\\ninto their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further\\r\\nside of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.  This served for a\\r\\nsea-sofa.  Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,\\r\\nlooking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched\\r\\nin their heads.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke\\r\\nand sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric\\r\\nbrilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the\\r\\ncapricious emblazonings of the works.  As they narrated to each other\\r\\ntheir unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of\\r\\nmirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like\\r\\nthe flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the\\r\\nharpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and\\r\\ndippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship\\r\\ngroaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and\\r\\nfurther into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\\r\\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\\r\\nall sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\\r\\nwith fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\\r\\ndarkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac\\r\\ncommander\\'s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours\\r\\nsilently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.  Wrapped, for\\r\\nthat interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,\\r\\nthe madness, the ghastliness of others.  The continual sight of the\\r\\nfiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,\\r\\nthese at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to\\r\\nyield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me\\r\\nat a midnight helm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since\\r\\ninexplicable) thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing\\r\\nsleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.  The\\r\\njaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears\\r\\nwas the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I\\r\\nthought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers\\r\\nto the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.\\r\\nBut, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by;\\r\\nthough it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by\\r\\nthe steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.  Nothing seemed before me\\r\\nbut a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.\\r\\nUppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I\\r\\nstood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all\\r\\nhavens astern.  A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over\\r\\nme.  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy\\r\\nconceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,\\r\\ninverted.  My God! what is the matter with me? thought I.  Lo! in my\\r\\nbrief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship\\'s\\r\\nstern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I\\r\\nfaced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into\\r\\nthe wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful\\r\\nthe relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the\\r\\nfatal contingency of being brought by the lee!\\r\\n\\r\\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream with\\r\\nthy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the\\r\\nfirst hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire,\\r\\nwhen its redness makes all things look ghastly.  To-morrow, in the\\r\\nnatural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils\\r\\nin the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least\\r\\ngentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true\\r\\nlamp--all others but liars!\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia\\'s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome\\'s\\r\\naccursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of\\r\\ndeserts and of griefs beneath the moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,\\r\\nwhich is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this\\r\\nearth.  So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than\\r\\nsorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or\\r\\nundeveloped.  With books the same.  The truest of all men was the Man\\r\\nof Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon\\'s, and\\r\\nEcclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.  \"All is vanity.\"\\r\\nALL.  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon\\'s\\r\\nwisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast\\r\\ncrossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;\\r\\ncalls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;\\r\\nand throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing\\r\\nwise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit down on\\r\\ntomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably\\r\\nwondrous Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even Solomon, he says, \"the man that wandereth out of the way of\\r\\nunderstanding shall remain\" (I.E., even while living) \"in the\\r\\ncongregation of the dead.\"  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest\\r\\nit invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.  There is a\\r\\nwisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.  And there is\\r\\na Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the\\r\\nblackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in\\r\\nthe sunny spaces.  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,\\r\\nthat gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the\\r\\nmountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even\\r\\nthough they soar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 97\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you descended from the Pequod\\'s try-works to the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\\r\\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in some\\r\\nilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they\\r\\nlay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled\\r\\nmuteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\\r\\nqueens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\\r\\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.  But the whaleman, as\\r\\nhe seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.  He makes his berth\\r\\nan Aladdin\\'s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest\\r\\nnight the ship\\'s black hull still houses an illumination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\\r\\nlamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler\\r\\nat the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a\\r\\nvat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,\\r\\ntherefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or\\r\\nastral contrivances ashore.  It is sweet as early grass butter in\\r\\nApril.  He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its\\r\\nfreshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts\\r\\nup his own supper of game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 98\\r\\n\\r\\nStowing Down and Clearing Up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\\r\\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\\r\\nand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\\r\\nalongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\\r\\nheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\\r\\ngreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\\r\\ndue time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,\\r\\nand Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through\\r\\nthe fire;--but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this\\r\\npart of the description by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the\\r\\nromantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and\\r\\nstriking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns\\r\\nto his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as\\r\\nbefore; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\\r\\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and\\r\\nrolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are\\r\\nslewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously\\r\\nscoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at\\r\\nlast man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,\\r\\nrap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX\\r\\nOFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\\r\\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\\r\\nand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.  This done, the\\r\\nhatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\\r\\nincidents in all the business of whaling.  One day the planks stream\\r\\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\\r\\nmasses of the whale\\'s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\\r\\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has\\r\\nbesooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with\\r\\nunctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on\\r\\nall hands the din is deafening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in\\r\\nthis self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and\\r\\ntry-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant\\r\\nvessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.  The unmanufactured\\r\\nsperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.  This is the\\r\\nreason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call\\r\\nan affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of\\r\\nthe whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any\\r\\nadhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side,\\r\\nthat lye quickly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the\\r\\nbulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their\\r\\nfull tidiness.  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the\\r\\nnumerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully\\r\\ncleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon\\r\\nthe try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\\r\\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the\\r\\ncombined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship\\'s\\r\\ncompany, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,\\r\\nthen the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift\\r\\nthemselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck,\\r\\nfresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest\\r\\nHolland.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\\r\\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\\r\\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object\\r\\nnot to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.  To\\r\\nhint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were\\r\\nlittle short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly\\r\\nallude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men\\r\\nintent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will\\r\\nagain soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small\\r\\ngrease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when, after the\\r\\nseverest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing\\r\\nstraight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they\\r\\nhave swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only\\r\\nstep to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass,\\r\\nand cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and\\r\\nburned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the\\r\\nequatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have\\r\\nfinally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless\\r\\ndairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning\\r\\nthe necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of \"There\\r\\nshe blows!\" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through\\r\\nthe whole weary thing again.  Oh! my friends, but this is\\r\\nman-killing!  Yet this is life.  For hardly have we mortals by long\\r\\ntoilings extracted from this world\\'s vast bulk its small but\\r\\nvaluable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves\\r\\nfrom its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles\\r\\nof the soul; hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost\\r\\nis spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go\\r\\nthrough young life\\'s old routine again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two\\r\\nthousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with\\r\\nthee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,\\r\\ntaught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 99\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doubloon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his\\r\\nquarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and\\r\\nmainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration\\r\\nit has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most\\r\\nplunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and\\r\\nstand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.  When\\r\\nhe halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the\\r\\npointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with\\r\\nthe pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he\\r\\nagain paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance\\r\\nfastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same\\r\\naspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,\\r\\nif not hopefulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\\r\\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\\r\\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\\r\\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.  And\\r\\nsome certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are\\r\\nlittle worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except\\r\\nto sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up\\r\\nsome morass in the Milky Way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of\\r\\nthe heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden\\r\\nsands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.  And though now\\r\\nnailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of\\r\\ncopper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it\\r\\nstill preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed amongst a\\r\\nruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through\\r\\nthe livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover\\r\\nany pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon\\r\\nwhere the sunset left it last.  For it was set apart and sanctified\\r\\nto one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one\\r\\nand all, the mariners revered it as the white whale\\'s talisman.\\r\\nSometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering\\r\\nwhose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the\\r\\nsun and tropic token-pieces.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;\\r\\nsun\\'s disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners\\r\\nwaving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold\\r\\nseems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,\\r\\nby passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy\\r\\nexample of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,\\r\\nREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a\\r\\ncountry planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great\\r\\nequator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the\\r\\nAndes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those\\r\\nletters you saw the likeness of three Andes\\' summits; from one a\\r\\nflame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching\\r\\nover all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all\\r\\nmarked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering\\r\\nthe equinoctial point at Libra.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now\\r\\npausing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and\\r\\nall other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as\\r\\nLucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab;\\r\\nthe courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is\\r\\nAhab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the\\r\\nrounder globe, which, like a magician\\'s glass, to each and every man\\r\\nin turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains, small\\r\\ngains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve\\r\\nitself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!\\r\\naye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months\\r\\nbefore he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!  From storm to\\r\\nstorm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes, \\'t is fit that man should\\r\\nlive in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, then!  Here\\'s stout stuff\\r\\nfor woe to work on.  So be it, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil\\'s claws must have\\r\\nleft their mouldings there since yesterday,\" murmured Starbuck to\\r\\nhimself, leaning against the bulwarks.  \"The old man seems to read\\r\\nBelshazzar\\'s awful writing.  I have never marked the coin\\r\\ninspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between\\r\\nthree mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in\\r\\nsome faint earthly symbol.  So in this vale of Death, God girds us\\r\\nround; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines\\r\\na beacon and a hope.  If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows\\r\\nher mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance\\r\\nhalf way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at\\r\\nmidnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze\\r\\nfor him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still\\r\\nsadly to me.  I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now\\'s the old Mogul,\" soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,\\r\\n\"he\\'s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and\\r\\nboth with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine\\r\\nfathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I\\r\\nhave it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer\\'s Hook, I\\'d not look at it\\r\\nvery long ere spending it.  Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,\\r\\nI regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before now in my\\r\\nvoyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your\\r\\ndoubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of\\r\\nPopayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and\\r\\nhalf joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be in this\\r\\ndoubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?  By Golconda!\\r\\nlet me read it once.  Halloa! here\\'s signs and wonders truly!  That,\\r\\nnow, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what\\r\\nmy almanac below calls ditto.  I\\'ll get the almanac and as I have\\r\\nheard devils can be raised with Daboll\\'s arithmetic, I\\'ll try my hand\\r\\nat raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the\\r\\nMassachusetts calendar.  Here\\'s the book.  Let\\'s see now.  Signs and\\r\\nwonders; and the sun, he\\'s always among \\'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here\\r\\nthey are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the\\r\\nBull and Jimimi! here\\'s Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun\\r\\nhe wheels among \\'em.  Aye, here on the coin he\\'s just crossing the\\r\\nthreshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.  Book!\\r\\nyou lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.  You\\'ll\\r\\ndo to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the\\r\\nthoughts.  That\\'s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts\\r\\ncalendar, and Bowditch\\'s navigator, and Daboll\\'s arithmetic go.\\r\\nSigns and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs,\\r\\nand significant in wonders!  There\\'s a clue somewhere; wait a bit;\\r\\nhist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac\\r\\nhere is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I\\'ll read it\\r\\noff, straight out of the book.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: there\\'s\\r\\nAries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the\\r\\nBull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--that\\r\\nis, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer\\r\\nthe Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a\\r\\nroaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly\\r\\ndabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that\\'s our\\r\\nfirst love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes\\r\\nLibra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while\\r\\nwe are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,\\r\\nor the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when\\r\\nwhang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is\\r\\namusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here\\'s\\r\\nthe battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes\\r\\nrushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the\\r\\nWater-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind\\r\\nup with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.  There\\'s a sermon now, writ\\r\\nin high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes\\r\\nout of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, aloft there, wheels\\r\\nthrough toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh,\\r\\njolly\\'s the word for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes\\r\\nlittle King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let\\'s hear what\\r\\nhe\\'ll have to say.  There; he\\'s before it; he\\'ll out with something\\r\\npresently.  So, so; he\\'s beginning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever\\r\\nraises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what\\'s\\r\\nall this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that\\'s\\r\\ntrue; and at two cents the cigar, that\\'s nine hundred and sixty\\r\\ncigars.  I won\\'t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and\\r\\nhere\\'s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to\\r\\nspy \\'em out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has\\r\\na foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a\\r\\nsort of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old\\r\\nManxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he\\r\\ntook to the sea.  He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes\\r\\nround on the other side of the mast; why, there\\'s a horse-shoe nailed\\r\\non that side; and now he\\'s back again; what does that mean?  Hark!\\r\\nhe\\'s muttering--voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick ears,\\r\\nand listen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when\\r\\nthe sun stands in some one of these signs.  I\\'ve studied signs, and\\r\\nknow their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old\\r\\nwitch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?  The\\r\\nhorse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.  And\\r\\nwhat\\'s the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the\\r\\nroaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to\\r\\nthink of thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men\\r\\nin one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all\\r\\ntattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the\\r\\nCannibal?  As I live he\\'s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;\\r\\nthinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I\\r\\nsuppose, as the old women talk Surgeon\\'s Astronomy in the back\\r\\ncountry.  And by Jove, he\\'s found something there in the vicinity of\\r\\nhis thigh--I guess it\\'s Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don\\'t\\r\\nknow what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off\\r\\nsome king\\'s trowsers.  But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,\\r\\nFedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his\\r\\npumps as usual.  What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only\\r\\nmakes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the\\r\\ncoin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way\\r\\ncomes Pip--poor boy! would he had died, or I; he\\'s half horrible to\\r\\nme.  He too has been watching all of these interpreters--myself\\r\\nincluded--and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot\\r\\nface.  Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my soul, he\\'s been studying Murray\\'s Grammar!  Improving his\\r\\nmind, poor fellow!

Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\\r\\nbearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\\r\\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\\r\\nto the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own\\r\\nboat\\'s bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\\r\\nfine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\\r\\nroundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and\\r\\none empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered\\r\\narm of a hussar\\'s surcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See you this?\" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden\\r\\nit, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a\\r\\nwooden head like a mallet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man my boat!\" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars\\r\\nnear him--\"Stand by to lower!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\\r\\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\\r\\nstranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the\\r\\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of\\r\\nhis leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\\r\\nhis own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\\r\\nmechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\\r\\nrigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment\\'s warning.  Now,\\r\\nit is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\\r\\nhourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship\\'s side from a\\r\\nboat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\\r\\ntowards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\\r\\nto the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\\r\\ncourse being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\\r\\nnow found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\\r\\nhopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope\\r\\nto attain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\\r\\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\\r\\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\\r\\nAnd in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\\r\\nthe two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\\r\\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\\r\\na pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\\r\\nseem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\\r\\ncripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\\r\\nlasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\\r\\nhow affairs stood, cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there!\\r\\nJump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\\r\\ntwo previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\\r\\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\\r\\nend.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\\r\\nall, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\\r\\nsitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\\r\\nand then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\\r\\nalso helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\\r\\none of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\\r\\ninside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\\r\\nWith his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\\r\\nadvanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\\r\\narm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\\r\\naye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\\r\\nthat never can shrink, d\\'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\\r\\ndid\\'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\\r\\ntowards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had\\r\\nbeen a telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\\r\\nthe capstan, and resting on the Englishman\\'s shoulder, as he did so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spin me the yarn,\" said Ahab; \"how was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\\r\\nbegan the Englishman.  \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\\r\\ntime.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\\r\\nmy boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\\r\\nthat went milling and milling round so, that my boat\\'s crew could\\r\\nonly trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\\r\\nPresently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\\r\\nwhale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows\\' feet and\\r\\nwrinkles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\\r\\nsuspended breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but\\r\\non!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\\r\\n\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\\r\\nall afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\\r\\nfast-line!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\\r\\nknow him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not\\r\\nknow; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\\r\\nsomehow; but we didn\\'t know it then; so that when we afterwards\\r\\npulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\\r\\nthe other whale\\'s; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\\r\\nhow matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\\r\\nand biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\\r\\nspite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\\r\\nhap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\\r\\nmight draw (for I have a devil of a boat\\'s crew for a pull on a\\r\\nwhale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate\\'s\\r\\nboat--Mr. Mounttop\\'s here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\\r\\nMounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop\\'s\\r\\nboat, which, d\\'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and\\r\\nsnatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\\r\\nBut, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\\r\\ninstant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\\r\\nand bedeadened with black foam--the whale\\'s tail looming straight up\\r\\nout of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\\r\\nsterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\\r\\nsun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\\r\\niron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\\r\\ncutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\\r\\nfirst, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\\r\\nchips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\\r\\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\\r\\nclung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\\r\\nand at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\\r\\nwent down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\\r\\ntowing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below\\r\\nhis shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\\r\\nHell\\'s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the\\r\\ngood God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the\\r\\nwhole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I\\r\\nfloated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the\\r\\nway, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship\\'s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the\\r\\ncaptain).  Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\\r\\nthe time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\\r\\nhis gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but\\r\\nsober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\\r\\npatched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention\\r\\nbetween a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in\\r\\nthe other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs\\r\\nof the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior\\'s introduction of\\r\\nhim to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his\\r\\ncaptain\\'s bidding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a shocking bad wound,\" began the whale-surgeon; \"and, taking\\r\\nmy advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\" interrupted the one-armed\\r\\ncaptain, addressing Ahab; \"go on, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing\\r\\nhot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;\\r\\nsat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of\\r\\ndiet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, very severe!\" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\\r\\naltering his voice, \"Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,\\r\\ntill he couldn\\'t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,\\r\\nhalf seas over, about three o\\'clock in the morning.  Oh, ye stars! he\\r\\nsat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.  Oh! a great\\r\\nwatcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you\\r\\ndog, laugh out! why don\\'t ye?  You know you\\'re a precious jolly\\r\\nrascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I\\'d rather be killed by you than kept\\r\\nalive by any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir\"--said\\r\\nthe imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--\"is\\r\\napt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that\\r\\nsort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that\\r\\nI myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend\\r\\nclergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Water!\" cried the captain; \"he never drinks it; it\\'s a sort of fits\\r\\nto him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on\\r\\nwith the arm story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I may as well,\" said the surgeon, coolly.  \"I was about\\r\\nobserving, sir, before Captain Boomer\\'s facetious interruption, that\\r\\nspite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\\r\\nand worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\\r\\never saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it\\r\\nwith the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was\\r\\nthreatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that\\r\\nivory arm there; that thing is against all rule\"--pointing at it with\\r\\nthe marlingspike--\"that is the captain\\'s work, not mine; he ordered\\r\\nthe carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the\\r\\nend, to knock some one\\'s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine\\r\\nonce.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this\\r\\ndent, sir\"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and\\r\\nexposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the\\r\\nslightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a\\r\\nwound--\"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;\\r\\nhe knows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born\\r\\nwith it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such\\r\\nanother Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought\\r\\nto die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,\\r\\nyou rascal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What became of the White Whale?\" now cried Ahab, who thus far had\\r\\nbeen impatiently listening to this by-play between the two\\r\\nEnglishmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried the one-armed captain, \"oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,\\r\\nwe didn\\'t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\\r\\ndidn\\'t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\\r\\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard\\r\\nabout Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did\\'st thou cross his wake again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But could not fasten?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t want to try to: ain\\'t one limb enough?  What should I do\\r\\nwithout this other arm?  And I\\'m thinking Moby Dick doesn\\'t bite so\\r\\nmuch as he swallows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to\\r\\nget the right.  Do you know, gentlemen\"--very gravely and\\r\\nmathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--\"Do you know,\\r\\ngentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\\r\\nconstructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him\\r\\nto completely digest even a man\\'s arm?  And he knows it too.  So that\\r\\nwhat you take for the White Whale\\'s malice is only his awkwardness.\\r\\nFor he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to\\r\\nterrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,\\r\\nformerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow\\r\\njack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,\\r\\nand there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an\\r\\nemetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d\\'ye see.  No possible\\r\\nway for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into\\r\\nhis general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick\\r\\nenough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the\\r\\nprivilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case\\r\\nthe arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you\\r\\nshortly, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank ye, Bunger,\" said the English Captain, \"he\\'s welcome to\\r\\nthe arm he has, since I can\\'t help it, and didn\\'t know him then; but\\r\\nnot to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I\\'ve lowered for\\r\\nhim once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in\\r\\nkilling him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm\\r\\nin him, but, hark ye, he\\'s best let alone; don\\'t you think so,\\r\\nCaptain?\"--glancing at the ivory leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best let\\r\\nalone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.  He\\'s\\r\\nall a magnet!  How long since thou saw\\'st him last?  Which way\\r\\nheading?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend\\'s,\" cried Bunger, stoopingly\\r\\nwalking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; \"this man\\'s\\r\\nblood--bring the thermometer!--it\\'s at the boiling point!--his pulse\\r\\nmakes these planks beat!--sir!\"--taking a lancet from his pocket, and\\r\\ndrawing near to Ahab\\'s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast!\" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--\"Man the\\r\\nboat!  Which way heading?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain\\r\\ncrazy?\" whispering Fedallah.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to\\r\\ntake the boat\\'s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle\\r\\ntowards him, commanded the ship\\'s sailors to stand by to lower.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment he was standing in the boat\\'s stern, and the Manilla men\\r\\nwere springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed\\r\\nhim.  With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to\\r\\nhis own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 101\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Decanter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\\r\\nhailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\\r\\nmerchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\\r\\nEnderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\\'s opinion, comes\\r\\nnot far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in\\r\\npoint of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year of\\r\\nour Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\\r\\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted\\r\\nout the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm\\r\\nWhale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our\\r\\nvaliant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large\\r\\nfleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South\\r\\nAtlantic: not elsewhere.  Be it distinctly recorded here, that the\\r\\nNantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized\\r\\nsteel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were\\r\\nthe only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\\r\\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\\r\\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of\\r\\nany sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful and lucky\\r\\none; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious\\r\\nsperm, the Amelia\\'s example was soon followed by other ships, English\\r\\nand American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific\\r\\nwere thrown open.  But not content with this good deed, the\\r\\nindefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his\\r\\nSons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate\\r\\nauspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British\\r\\ngovernment was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling\\r\\nvoyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval\\r\\nPost-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some\\r\\nservice; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.  In 1819,\\r\\nthe same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go\\r\\non a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--well\\r\\ncalled the \"Syren\"--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus\\r\\nthat the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.\\r\\nThe Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a\\r\\nNantucketer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists\\r\\nto the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long\\r\\nago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast\\r\\nsailer and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight\\r\\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\\r\\nforecastle.  It was a fine gam we had, and they were all\\r\\ntrumps--every soul on board.  A short life to them, and a jolly\\r\\ndeath.  And that fine gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab\\r\\ntouched her planks with his ivory heel--it minds me of the noble,\\r\\nsolid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,\\r\\nand the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I\\r\\nsay we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons\\r\\nthe hour; and when the squall came (for it\\'s squally off there by\\r\\nPatagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were called to reef\\r\\ntopsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft\\r\\nin bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into\\r\\nthe sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a\\r\\nwarning example to all drunken tars.  However, the masts did not go\\r\\noverboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to\\r\\npass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the\\r\\nforecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my\\r\\ntaste.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.  They said it was\\r\\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\\r\\ncertain, how that was.  They had dumplings too; small, but\\r\\nsubstantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I\\r\\nfancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after\\r\\nthey were swallowed.  If you stooped over too far forward, you risked\\r\\ntheir pitching out of you like billiard-balls.  The bread--but that\\r\\ncouldn\\'t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the\\r\\nbread contained the only fresh fare they had.  But the forecastle was\\r\\nnot very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner\\r\\nwhen you ate it.  But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,\\r\\nconsidering the dimensions of the cook\\'s boilers, including his own\\r\\nlive parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a\\r\\njolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack\\r\\nfellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\\r\\nEnglish whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,\\r\\nhospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the\\r\\ncan, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,\\r\\nand laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good cheer of these\\r\\nEnglish whalers is matter for historical research.  Nor have I been\\r\\nat all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed\\r\\nneeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\\r\\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\\r\\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,\\r\\ntouching plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a general thing, the\\r\\nEnglish merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English\\r\\nwhaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is\\r\\nnot normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,\\r\\ntherefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out,\\r\\nand will be still further elucidated.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\\r\\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\\r\\nmust be about whalers.  The title was, \"Dan Coopman,\" wherefore I\\r\\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\\r\\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.  I\\r\\nwas reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production\\r\\nof one \"Fitz Swackhammer.\"  But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very\\r\\nlearned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of\\r\\nSanta Claus and St. Pott\\'s, to whom I handed the work for\\r\\ntranslation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this\\r\\nsame Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that \"Dan\\r\\nCoopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper,\" but \"The Merchant.\"  In short,\\r\\nthis ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of\\r\\nHolland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting\\r\\naccount of its whale fishery.  And in this chapter it was, headed,\\r\\n\"Smeer,\" or \"Fat,\" that I found a long detailed list of the outfits\\r\\nfor the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which\\r\\nlist, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n400,000 lbs. of beef.\\r\\n60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.\\r\\n150,000 lbs. of stock fish.\\r\\n550,000 lbs. of biscuit.\\r\\n72,000 lbs. of soft bread.\\r\\n2,800 firkins of butter.\\r\\n20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.\\r\\n144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).\\r\\n550 ankers of Geneva.\\r\\n10,800 barrels of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\\r\\nthe present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\\r\\npipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\\r\\nthis beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\\r\\nincidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and\\r\\nPlatonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary\\r\\ntables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,\\r\\nconsumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and\\r\\nSpitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,\\r\\nand Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,\\r\\nthough, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still\\r\\nmore unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by\\r\\ntheir pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very\\r\\ncoasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge\\r\\neach other in bumpers of train oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.  Now,\\r\\nas those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer\\r\\nof that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch\\r\\nwhalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,\\r\\ndid not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each\\r\\nof their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all;\\r\\ntherefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for\\r\\na twelve weeks\\' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that\\r\\n550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so\\r\\nfuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of\\r\\nmen to stand up in a boat\\'s head, and take good aim at flying whales;\\r\\nthis would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and\\r\\nhit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where\\r\\nbeer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our\\r\\nsouthern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at\\r\\nthe mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to\\r\\nNantucket and New Bedford.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers\\r\\nof two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\\r\\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example.  For, say they,\\r\\nwhen cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of\\r\\nthe world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.  And this empties\\r\\nthe decanter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 102\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bower in the Arsacides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have\\r\\nchiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and\\r\\nin detail upon some few interior structural features.  But to a large\\r\\nand thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to\\r\\nunbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,\\r\\nunbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of\\r\\nthe joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his\\r\\nultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\\r\\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\\r\\nwhale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver\\r\\nlectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass,\\r\\nhold up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael.\\r\\nCan you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a\\r\\ncook dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veritable witness have you\\r\\nhitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege\\r\\nof Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and\\r\\nbeams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making\\r\\nup the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,\\r\\ndairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\\r\\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been\\r\\nblessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.  In a ship I\\r\\nbelonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the\\r\\ndeck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the\\r\\nharpoons, and for the heads of the lances.  Think you I let that\\r\\nchance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking\\r\\nthe seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\\r\\ngigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am\\r\\nindebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of\\r\\nthe Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the\\r\\ntrading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the\\r\\nArsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm\\r\\nvilla at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our\\r\\nsailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being\\r\\ngifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had\\r\\nbrought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious\\r\\nof his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful\\r\\ndevices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic\\r\\ncanoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\\r\\nwonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\\r\\nunusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with\\r\\nhis head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted\\r\\ndroopings seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last\\r\\nbeen stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become\\r\\ndust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up\\r\\nthe Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with\\r\\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the\\r\\npriests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic\\r\\nhead again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a\\r\\nbough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like\\r\\nthe hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy\\r\\nGlen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\\r\\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weaver\\'s loom, with a gorgeous\\r\\ncarpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and\\r\\nwoof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all\\r\\ntheir laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\\r\\nmessage-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the\\r\\nlacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\\r\\nthe unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one\\r\\nword!--whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore\\r\\nall these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but\\r\\none single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float\\r\\nfrom forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides\\r\\naway.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,\\r\\nthat he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look\\r\\non the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear\\r\\nthe thousand voices that speak through it.  For even so it is in all\\r\\nmaterial factories.  The spoken words that are inaudible among the\\r\\nflying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the\\r\\nwalls, bursting from the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies\\r\\nbeen detected.  Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din\\r\\nof the great world\\'s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard\\r\\nafar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\\r\\ngreat, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!\\r\\nYet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed\\r\\naround him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all\\r\\nwoven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher\\r\\nverdure; but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised\\r\\nLife; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him\\r\\ncurly-headed glories.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw\\r\\nthe skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the\\r\\nreal jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel\\r\\nas an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the\\r\\npriests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I\\r\\npaced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through\\r\\nthe ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long\\r\\namid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my\\r\\nline was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I\\r\\nentered.  I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\\r\\nskeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived\\r\\nme taking the altitude of the final rib, \"How now!\" they shouted;\\r\\n\"Dar\\'st thou measure this our god!  That\\'s for us.\"  \"Aye,\\r\\npriests--well, how long do ye make him, then?\"  But hereupon a fierce\\r\\ncontest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked\\r\\neach other\\'s sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull\\r\\nechoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own\\r\\nadmeasurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you.  But first, be\\r\\nit recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\\r\\nmeasurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you\\r\\ncan refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum,\\r\\nthey tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that\\r\\ncountry, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other\\r\\nwhales.  Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in\\r\\nNew Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call \"the only perfect\\r\\nspecimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.\"\\r\\nMoreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,\\r\\na certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton\\r\\nof a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown\\r\\nmagnitude of my friend King Tranquo\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\\r\\nbelonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\\r\\ngrounds.  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\\r\\nClifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.  Sir\\r\\nClifford\\'s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a\\r\\ngreat chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\\r\\ncavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day\\r\\nupon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors\\r\\nand shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a\\r\\nbunch of keys at his side.  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence\\r\\nfor a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence\\r\\nto hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for\\r\\nthe unrivalled view from his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\\r\\nverbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\\r\\nwanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of\\r\\npreserving such valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,\\r\\nand wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a\\r\\npoem I was then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might\\r\\nremain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed,\\r\\nshould inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the\\r\\nwhale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 103\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement of The Whale\\'s Skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\\r\\nstatement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\\r\\nwe are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly\\r\\nbase upon Captain Scoresby\\'s estimate, of seventy tons for the\\r\\nlargest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to\\r\\nmy careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest\\r\\nmagnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and\\r\\nsomething less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a\\r\\nwhale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen\\r\\nmen to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population\\r\\nof a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\\r\\nthis leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\\'s\\r\\nimagination?\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\\r\\njaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\\r\\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\\r\\nunobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\\r\\na proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far\\r\\nthe most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated\\r\\nconcerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your\\r\\nmind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a\\r\\ncomplete notion of the general structure we are about to view.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\\'s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\\r\\nFeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\\r\\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\\r\\nfifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\\r\\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\\r\\nfifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\\r\\nsomething less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular\\r\\nbasket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\\r\\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\\r\\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\\r\\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\\r\\nfor the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\\r\\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\\r\\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\\r\\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\\r\\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\\r\\nonly spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\\r\\nall bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\\r\\nwere the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for\\r\\nbeams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\r\\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton\\r\\nof the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The\\r\\nlargest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\\r\\npart of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the\\r\\ngreatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must\\r\\nhave been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib\\r\\nmeasured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only\\r\\nconveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that\\r\\npart.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all\\r\\nthat had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\\r\\nmuscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\\r\\nsaw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and\\r\\nmajestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to\\r\\ntry to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over\\r\\nhis dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\\r\\nOnly in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\\r\\nof his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the\\r\\nfully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\\r\\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But\\r\\nnow it\\'s done, it looks much like Pompey\\'s Pillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\\r\\nnot locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks\\r\\non a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The\\r\\nlargest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,\\r\\nand in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers\\r\\naway into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something\\r\\nlike a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller\\r\\nones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the\\r\\npriest\\'s children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we\\r\\nsee how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off\\r\\nat last into simple child\\'s play.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 104\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fossil Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\\r\\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you, you could\\r\\nnot compress him.  By good rights he should only be treated of in\\r\\nimperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to\\r\\ntail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the\\r\\ngigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like\\r\\ngreat cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck\\r\\nof a line-of-battle-ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me\\r\\nto approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\\r\\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\\r\\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels.  Having already described\\r\\nhim in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities,\\r\\nit now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous,\\r\\nand antediluvian point of view.  Applied to any other creature than\\r\\nthe Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be\\r\\ndeemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,\\r\\nthe case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under\\r\\nthe weightiest words of the dictionary.  And here be it said, that\\r\\nwhenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these\\r\\ndissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of\\r\\nJohnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous\\r\\nlexicographer\\'s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a\\r\\nlexicon to be used by a whale author like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,\\r\\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me, writing\\r\\nof this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\\r\\ncapitals.  Give me a condor\\'s quill!  Give me Vesuvius\\' crater for an\\r\\ninkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!  For in the mere act of penning my\\r\\nthoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with\\r\\ntheir outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the\\r\\nwhole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and\\r\\nmen, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the\\r\\nrevolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole\\r\\nuniverse, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the\\r\\nvirtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.  To\\r\\nproduce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  No great and\\r\\nenduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be\\r\\nwho have tried it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\\r\\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time\\r\\nI have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,\\r\\ncanals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.\\r\\nLikewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that\\r\\nwhile in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of\\r\\nmonsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics\\r\\ndiscovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the\\r\\nconnecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the\\r\\nantichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to\\r\\nhave entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered\\r\\nbelong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the\\r\\nsuperficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to\\r\\nany known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin\\r\\nto them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as\\r\\nCetacean fossils.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their\\r\\nbones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various\\r\\nintervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in\\r\\nFrance, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,\\r\\nMississippi, and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is\\r\\npart of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue\\r\\nDauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the\\r\\npalace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the\\r\\ngreat docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon\\'s time.  Cuvier pronounced these\\r\\nfragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic\\r\\nspecies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\\r\\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,\\r\\non the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken\\r\\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\\r\\nfallen angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and\\r\\nbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones\\r\\nof it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it\\r\\nturned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a\\r\\ndeparted species.  A significant illustration of the fact, again and\\r\\nagain repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes\\r\\nbut little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.  So Owen\\r\\nrechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the\\r\\nLondon Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the\\r\\nmost extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have\\r\\nblotted out of existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,\\r\\njaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances\\r\\nto the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing\\r\\non the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\\r\\nLeviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back\\r\\nto that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;\\r\\nfor time began with man.  Here Saturn\\'s grey chaos rolls over me, and\\r\\nI obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when\\r\\nwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;\\r\\nand in all the 25,000 miles of this world\\'s circumference, not an\\r\\ninhabitable hand\\'s breadth of land was visible.  Then the whole world\\r\\nwas the whale\\'s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the\\r\\npresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can show a\\r\\npedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab\\'s harpoon had shed older blood than\\r\\nthe Pharaoh\\'s.  Methuselah seems a school-boy.  I look round to shake\\r\\nhands with Shem.  I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced\\r\\nexistence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been\\r\\nbefore all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\\r\\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\\r\\nancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to\\r\\nclaim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the\\r\\nunmistakable print of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple\\r\\nof Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the\\r\\ngranite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in\\r\\ncentaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures\\r\\non the celestial globe of the moderns.  Gliding among them, old\\r\\nLeviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,\\r\\ncenturies before Solomon was cradled.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the\\r\\nantiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as\\r\\nset down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams\\r\\nof which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\\r\\noftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.  The Common People imagine,\\r\\nthat by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can\\r\\npass it without immediate death.  But the truth of the Matter is,\\r\\nthat on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two\\r\\nMiles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon \\'em.\\r\\nThey keep a Whale\\'s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which\\r\\nlying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch,\\r\\nthe Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel\\'s Back.\\r\\nThis Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years\\r\\nbefore I saw it.  Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who\\r\\nprophesy\\'d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand\\r\\nto assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the\\r\\nBase of the Temple.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be\\r\\na Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 105\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the Whale\\'s Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\\r\\nthe head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,\\r\\nin the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from\\r\\nthe original bulk of his sires.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\\r\\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\\r\\nfound in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\\r\\nprior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\\r\\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its\\r\\nearlier ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\\r\\nAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\\r\\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton.  Whereas, we have already\\r\\nseen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton\\r\\nof a large sized modern whale.  And I have heard, on whalemen\\'s\\r\\nauthority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet\\r\\nlong at the time of capture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\\r\\nadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;\\r\\nmay it not be, that since Adam\\'s time they have degenerated?\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of\\r\\nsuch gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.  For\\r\\nPliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\\r\\nAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in\\r\\nlength--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the\\r\\ndays of Banks and Solander, Cooke\\'s naturalists, we find a Danish\\r\\nmember of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales\\r\\n(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;\\r\\nthat is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the French\\r\\nnaturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning\\r\\nof his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred\\r\\nmetres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.  And this work was\\r\\npublished so late as A.D. 1825.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories?  No.  The whale of\\r\\nto-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny\\'s time.  And if ever I go\\r\\nwhere Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to\\r\\ntell him so.  Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the\\r\\nEgyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even\\r\\nPliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern\\r\\nKentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals\\r\\nsculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the\\r\\nrelative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove\\r\\nthat the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only\\r\\nequal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh\\'s fat kine;\\r\\nin the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the\\r\\nwhale alone should have degenerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\\r\\nrecondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient\\r\\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even\\r\\nthrough Behring\\'s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\\r\\nlockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted\\r\\nalong all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan\\r\\ncan long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether\\r\\nhe must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last\\r\\nwhale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself\\r\\nevaporate in the final puff.\\r\\n\\r\\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of\\r\\nbuffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands\\r\\nthe prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and\\r\\nscowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous\\r\\nriver-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a\\r\\ndollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would\\r\\nseem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape\\r\\nspeedy extinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short a\\r\\nperiod ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in\\r\\nIllinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the\\r\\npresent day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;\\r\\nand though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of\\r\\nman; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily\\r\\nforbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one ship\\r\\nhunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done\\r\\nextremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of\\r\\nforty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian\\r\\nhunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset\\r\\nsuns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of\\r\\nmoccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse\\r\\ninstead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty\\r\\nthousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be\\r\\nstatistically stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\\r\\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\\r\\nyears (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\\r\\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\\r\\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much\\r\\nmore remunerative.  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those\\r\\nwhales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in\\r\\nimmense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries,\\r\\nyokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into\\r\\nvast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And\\r\\nequally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called\\r\\nwhale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years\\r\\nabounding with them, hence that species also is declining.  For they\\r\\nare only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no\\r\\nlonger enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and\\r\\nremoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar\\r\\nspectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have\\r\\ntwo firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever\\r\\nremain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the\\r\\nfrosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the\\r\\nsavannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at\\r\\nlast resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate\\r\\nglassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes;\\r\\nand in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all\\r\\npursuit from man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\\r\\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that\\r\\nthis positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their\\r\\nbattalions.  But though for some time past a number of these whales,\\r\\nnot less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor\\'-west\\r\\ncoast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which\\r\\nrender even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing\\r\\nargument in this matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the\\r\\npopulousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what\\r\\nshall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at\\r\\none hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those\\r\\nregions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate\\r\\nclimes.  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,\\r\\nwhich have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by\\r\\nPorus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the\\r\\nEast--if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the\\r\\ngreat whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate\\r\\nin, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,\\r\\nEurope and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea\\r\\ncombined.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity\\r\\nof whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,\\r\\ntherefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult\\r\\ngenerations must be contemporary.  And what that is, we may soon\\r\\ngain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and\\r\\nfamily vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,\\r\\nwomen, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding\\r\\nthis countless host to the present human population of the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his\\r\\nspecies, however perishable in his individuality.  He swam the seas\\r\\nbefore the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the\\r\\nTuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah\\'s flood he\\r\\ndespised Noah\\'s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,\\r\\nlike the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale\\r\\nwill still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the\\r\\nequatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 106\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab\\'s Leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\\r\\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence\\r\\nto his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of\\r\\nhis boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.\\r\\nAnd when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he\\r\\nso vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman\\r\\n(it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly\\r\\nenough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional\\r\\ntwist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all\\r\\nappearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\\r\\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to\\r\\nthe condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.  For it\\r\\nhad not been very long prior to the Pequod\\'s sailing from Nantucket,\\r\\nthat he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and\\r\\ninsensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable\\r\\ncasualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it\\r\\nhad stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it\\r\\nwithout extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely\\r\\ncured.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that\\r\\nall the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct\\r\\nissue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the\\r\\nmost poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as\\r\\ninevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with\\r\\nevery felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like.\\r\\nYea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\\r\\nposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.\\r\\nFor, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain\\r\\ncanonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have\\r\\nno children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,\\r\\nshall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell\\'s despair;\\r\\nwhereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to\\r\\nthemselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the\\r\\ngrave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in\\r\\nthe deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab, while even the\\r\\nhighest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness\\r\\nlurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic\\r\\nsignificance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their\\r\\ndiligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the\\r\\ngenealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among\\r\\nthe sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of\\r\\nall the glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round\\r\\nharvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods\\r\\nthemselves are not for ever glad.  The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark\\r\\nin the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\\r\\nproperly, in set way, have been disclosed before.  With many other\\r\\nparticulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to\\r\\nsome, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after\\r\\nthe sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such\\r\\nGrand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\\r\\nspeechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\\r\\nCaptain Peleg\\'s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\\r\\nadequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab\\'s deeper part, every\\r\\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\\r\\nlight.  But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at\\r\\nleast.  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary\\r\\nrecluseness.  And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,\\r\\ndropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege\\r\\nof a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above\\r\\nhinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by\\r\\nAhab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the\\r\\nland of spirits and of wails.  So that, through their zeal for him,\\r\\nthey had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the\\r\\nknowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till\\r\\na considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the\\r\\nPequod\\'s decks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the\\r\\nair, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or\\r\\nnot with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he\\r\\ntook plain practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without\\r\\ndelay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him\\r\\nsupplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)\\r\\nwhich had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a\\r\\ncareful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be\\r\\nsecured.  This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg\\r\\ncompleted that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,\\r\\nindependent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.\\r\\nMoreover, the ship\\'s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its\\r\\ntemporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the\\r\\nblacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of\\r\\nwhatever iron contrivances might be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 107\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\\r\\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.\\r\\nBut from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part,\\r\\nthey seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and\\r\\nhereditary.  But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing\\r\\nan example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod\\'s carpenter\\r\\nwas no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those\\r\\nbelonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,\\r\\npractical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings\\r\\ncollateral to his own; the carpenter\\'s pursuit being the ancient and\\r\\noutbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or\\r\\nless have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the\\r\\napplication to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the\\r\\nPequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical\\r\\nemergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or\\r\\nfour years\\' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.  For not to\\r\\nspeak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--repairing stove boats,\\r\\nsprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting\\r\\nbull\\'s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and\\r\\nother miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special\\r\\nbusiness; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of\\r\\nconflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so\\r\\nmanifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished\\r\\nwith several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.\\r\\nAt all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was\\r\\nsecurely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\\r\\n\\r\\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its\\r\\nhole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\\r\\nstraightway files it smaller.  A lost land-bird of strange plumage\\r\\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\\r\\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\\r\\nmakes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman sprains his wrist:\\r\\nthe carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.  Stubb longed for\\r\\nvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;\\r\\nscrewing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter\\r\\nsymmetrically supplies the constellation.  A sailor takes a fancy to\\r\\nwear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.  Another\\r\\nhas the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand\\r\\nupon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow\\r\\nunmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round\\r\\nthe handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his\\r\\njaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike\\r\\nindifferent and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of\\r\\nivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held\\r\\nfor capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously\\r\\naccomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all\\r\\nthis would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.  But\\r\\nnot precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for\\r\\na certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it\\r\\nso shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed\\r\\none with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible\\r\\nworld; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still\\r\\neternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig\\r\\nfoundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in\\r\\nhim, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying\\r\\nheartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,\\r\\ncrutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now\\r\\nand then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served\\r\\nto pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle\\r\\nof Noah\\'s ark.  Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long\\r\\nwanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no\\r\\nmoss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward\\r\\nclingings might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript\\r\\nabstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;\\r\\nliving without premeditated reference to this world or the next.  You\\r\\nmight almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved\\r\\na sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem\\r\\nto work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had\\r\\nbeen tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\\r\\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\\r\\nprocess.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had\\r\\none, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.  He\\r\\nwas like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN\\r\\nPARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little\\r\\nswelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of\\r\\nvarious sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\\r\\npens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.  So, if his superiors\\r\\nwanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do\\r\\nwas to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for\\r\\ntweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\\r\\nwas, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not have\\r\\na common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow\\r\\nanomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of\\r\\nquicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But\\r\\nthere it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\\r\\nmore.  And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning\\r\\nlife-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the\\r\\ntime soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also\\r\\nhummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this\\r\\nsoliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself\\r\\nawake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 108\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab and the Carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deck--First Night Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE-BENCH, AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO\\r\\nLANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG, WHICH JOIST IS\\r\\nFIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE.

Ha! that\\'s the heel; we are in luck;\\r\\nhere he comes, or it\\'s somebody else, that\\'s certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAHAB (ADVANCING)\\r\\n\\r\\n(DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, manmaker!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust in time, sir.  If the captain pleases, I will now mark the\\r\\nlength.  Let me measure, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasured for a leg! good.  Well, it\\'s not the first time.  About it!\\r\\nThere; keep thy finger on it.  This is a cogent vice thou hast here,\\r\\ncarpenter; let me feel its grip once.  So, so; it does pinch some.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this\\r\\nslippery world that can hold, man.  What\\'s Prometheus about\\r\\nthere?--the blacksmith, I mean--what\\'s he about?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight.  It\\'s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.  He makes a\\r\\nfierce red flame there!\\r\\n\\r\\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\\r\\n\\r\\nUm-m.  So he must.  I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that\\r\\nold Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a\\r\\nblacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what\\'s made in fire must\\r\\nproperly belong to fire; and so hell\\'s probable.  How the soot flies!\\r\\nThis must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.\\r\\nCarpenter, when he\\'s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a\\r\\npair of steel shoulder-blades; there\\'s a pedlar aboard with a\\r\\ncrushing pack.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?\\r\\n\\r\\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I\\'ll order a complete man after a\\r\\ndesirable pattern.  Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then,\\r\\nchest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to \\'em,\\r\\nto stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no\\r\\nheart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine\\r\\nbrains; and let me see--shall I order eyes to see outwards?  No, but\\r\\nput a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.  There,\\r\\ntake the order, and away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what\\'s he speaking about, and who\\'s he speaking to, I should\\r\\nlike to know?  Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here\\'s one.\\r\\nNo, no, no; I must have a lantern.\\r\\n\\r\\nHo, ho!  That\\'s it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?\\r\\nThrusted light is worse than presented pistols.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarpenter? why that\\'s--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an\\r\\nextremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,\\r\\ncarpenter;--or would\\'st thou rather work in clay?\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That\\'s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fellow\\'s impious!  What art thou sneezing about?\\r\\n\\r\\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under\\r\\nliving people\\'s noses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?--oh! ah!--I guess so;--yes--dear!\\r\\n\\r\\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\\r\\nworkmanlike workman, eh?  Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well\\r\\nfor thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall\\r\\nnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it;\\r\\nthat is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean.\\r\\nCanst thou not drive that old Adam away?\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.  Yes, I have heard\\r\\nsomething curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never\\r\\nentirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still\\r\\npricking him at times.  May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, man.  Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once\\r\\nwas; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to\\r\\nthe soul.  Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there,\\r\\nthere to a hair, do I.  Is\\'t a riddle?\\r\\n\\r\\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nHist, then.  How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking\\r\\nthing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing\\r\\nprecisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy\\r\\nspite?  In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear\\r\\neavesdroppers?  Hold, don\\'t speak!  And if I still feel the smart of\\r\\nmy crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst\\r\\nnot thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and\\r\\nwithout a body?  Hah!\\r\\n\\r\\nGood Lord!  Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over\\r\\nagain; I think I didn\\'t carry a small figure, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before\\r\\nthe leg is done?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO).  Oh, Life!\\r\\nHere I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this\\r\\nblockhead for a bone to stand on!  Cursed be that mortal\\r\\ninter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.  I would be\\r\\nfree as air; and I\\'m down in the whole world\\'s books.  I am so rich,\\r\\nI could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the\\r\\nauction of the Roman empire (which was the world\\'s); and yet I owe\\r\\nfor the flesh in the tongue I brag with.  By heavens!  I\\'ll get a\\r\\ncrucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,\\r\\ncompendious vertebra.  So.\\r\\n\\r\\nCARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well, well!  Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says\\r\\nhe\\'s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;\\r\\nhe\\'s queer, says Stubb; he\\'s queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning\\r\\nit into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very\\r\\nqueer.  And here\\'s his leg!  Yes, now that I think of it, here\\'s his\\r\\nbedfellow! has a stick of whale\\'s jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is\\r\\nhis leg; he\\'ll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg\\r\\nstanding in three places, and all three places standing in one\\r\\nhell--how was that?  Oh!  I don\\'t wonder he looked so scornful at me!\\r\\nI\\'m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\\'s only\\r\\nhaphazard-like.  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never\\r\\nundertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built\\r\\ncaptains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and\\r\\nthere\\'s a great cry for life-boats.  And here\\'s the heron\\'s leg! long\\r\\nand slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a\\r\\nlifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a\\r\\ntender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.  But\\r\\nAhab; oh he\\'s a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death, and\\r\\nspavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.\\r\\nHalloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and\\r\\nlet\\'s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with\\r\\nhis horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round\\r\\ncollecting old beer barrels, to fill \\'em up again.  What a leg this\\r\\nis!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the\\r\\ncore; he\\'ll be standing on this to-morrow; he\\'ll be taking altitudes\\r\\non it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed\\r\\nivory, where he figures up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and\\r\\nsand-paper, now!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 109\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab and Starbuck in the Cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo!\\r\\nno inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must\\r\\nhave sprung a bad leak.  Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went\\r\\ndown into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it\\r\\nis a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and\\r\\ndrench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying\\r\\nintervals, is removed by the ship\\'s pumps.  Hereby the casks are\\r\\nsought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the\\r\\nwithdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in\\r\\nthe precious cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa\\r\\nand the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets\\r\\nfrom the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab\\r\\nwith a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;\\r\\nand another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the\\r\\nJapanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white\\r\\nnew ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a\\r\\nlong pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,\\r\\nwith his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and\\r\\ntracing his old courses again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning\\r\\nround to it.  \"On deck!  Begone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I.  The oil in the hold is leaking,\\r\\nsir.  We must up Burtons and break out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to\\r\\nhere for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make\\r\\ngood in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth\\r\\nsaving, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So it is, so it is; if we get it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.  Begone!  Let it\\r\\nleak!  I\\'m all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of\\r\\nleaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that\\'s a\\r\\nfar worse plight than the Pequod\\'s, man.  Yet I don\\'t stop to plug my\\r\\nleak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to\\r\\nplug it, even if found, in this life\\'s howling gale?  Starbuck!\\r\\nI\\'ll not have the Burtons hoisted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will the owners say, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.\\r\\nWhat cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art always prating to me,\\r\\nStarbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my\\r\\nconscience.  But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its\\r\\ncommander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship\\'s keel.--On\\r\\ndeck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab,\" said the reddening mate, moving further into the\\r\\ncabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it\\r\\nalmost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest\\r\\noutward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than\\r\\nhalf distrustful of itself; \"A better man than I might well pass over\\r\\nin thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,\\r\\nand in a happier, Captain Ahab.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of\\r\\nme?--On deck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be\\r\\nforbearing!  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\\r\\nSouth-Sea-men\\'s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\\r\\nexclaimed: \"There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one\\r\\nCaptain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery\\r\\ncheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the\\r\\nblaze of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half\\r\\ncalmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and\\r\\nsaid: \"Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask\\r\\nthee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab\\r\\nbeware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\"\\r\\nmurmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  \"What\\'s that he said--Ahab\\r\\nbeware of Ahab--there\\'s something there!\"  Then unconsciously using\\r\\nthe musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the\\r\\nlittle cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,\\r\\nand returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\" he said lowly to the\\r\\nmate; then raising his voice to the crew: \"Furl the t\\'gallant-sails,\\r\\nand close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up\\r\\nBurton, and break out in the main-hold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as\\r\\nrespecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of\\r\\nhonesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the\\r\\ncircumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open\\r\\ndisaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of\\r\\nhis ship.  However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons\\r\\nwere hoisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 110\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg in His Coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold\\r\\nwere perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.  So, it\\r\\nbeing calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the\\r\\nslumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight\\r\\nsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.  So deep did\\r\\nthey go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the\\r\\nlowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy\\r\\ncorner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of\\r\\nthe posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the\\r\\nflood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and\\r\\nshooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till\\r\\nat last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull\\r\\nechoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and\\r\\nreeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.\\r\\nTop-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in\\r\\nhis head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\\r\\nbosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him\\r\\nnigh to his endless end.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\\r\\ndignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\\r\\nhigher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg, who, as\\r\\nharpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,\\r\\nbut--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea;\\r\\nand finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating\\r\\nall day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the\\r\\nclumsiest casks and see to their stowage.  To be short, among\\r\\nwhalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\\r\\nhave stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there;\\r\\nwhere, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was\\r\\ncrawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted\\r\\nlizard at the bottom of a well.  And a well, or an ice-house, it\\r\\nsomehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the\\r\\nheat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a\\r\\nfever; and at last, after some days\\' suffering, laid him in his\\r\\nhammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted\\r\\nand wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed\\r\\nbut little left of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all else\\r\\nin him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,\\r\\nnevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a\\r\\nstrange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you\\r\\nthere from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health\\r\\nin him which could not die, or be weakened.  And like circles on the\\r\\nwater, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed\\r\\nrounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that\\r\\ncannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this\\r\\nwaning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld\\r\\nwho were bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly\\r\\nwondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.\\r\\nAnd the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike\\r\\nimpresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the\\r\\ndead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--no dying\\r\\nChaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose\\r\\nmysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as\\r\\nhe quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed\\r\\ngently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean\\'s invisible\\r\\nflood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\\r\\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\\r\\nasked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day\\r\\nwas just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket\\r\\nhe had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the\\r\\nrich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned\\r\\nthat all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark\\r\\ncanoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for\\r\\nit was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\\r\\ndead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be\\r\\nfloated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they\\r\\nbelieve that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible\\r\\nhorizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue\\r\\nheavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,\\r\\nthat he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,\\r\\naccording to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the\\r\\ndeath-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of\\r\\nNantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like\\r\\na whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that\\r\\ninvolved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\\r\\nwas at once commanded to do Queequeg\\'s bidding, whatever it might\\r\\ninclude.  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber\\r\\naboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the\\r\\naboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks\\r\\nthe coffin was recommended to be made.  No sooner was the carpenter\\r\\napprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all\\r\\nthe indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the\\r\\nforecastle and took Queequeg\\'s measure with great accuracy, regularly\\r\\nchalking Queequeg\\'s person as he shifted the rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! poor fellow! he\\'ll have to die now,\" ejaculated the Long Island\\r\\nsailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and\\r\\ngeneral reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length\\r\\nthe coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting\\r\\ntwo notches at its extremities.  This done, he marshalled the planks\\r\\nand his tools, and to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he\\r\\nlightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\\r\\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the\\r\\npeople on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every\\r\\none\\'s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly\\r\\nbrought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all\\r\\nmortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since\\r\\nthey will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows\\r\\nought to be indulged.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with\\r\\nan attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden\\r\\nstock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin\\r\\nalong with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\\r\\nalso, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\\r\\nfresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth\\r\\nscraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being\\r\\nrolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his\\r\\nfinal bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.\\r\\nHe lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag\\r\\nand bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his\\r\\nbreast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\\r\\ncalled it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a\\r\\nleather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but\\r\\nhis composed countenance in view.  \"Rarmai\" (it will do; it is easy),\\r\\nhe murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all\\r\\nthis while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,\\r\\ntook him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?\\r\\nwhere go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet\\r\\nAntilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye\\r\\ndo one little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who\\'s now been\\r\\nmissing long: I think he\\'s in those far Antilles.  If ye find him,\\r\\nthen comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he\\'s left his\\r\\ntambourine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,\\r\\ndie; and I\\'ll beat ye your dying march.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard,\" murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, \"that in\\r\\nviolent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;\\r\\nand that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in\\r\\ntheir wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been\\r\\nreally spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.  So, to my\\r\\nfond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings\\r\\nheavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.  Where learned he that,\\r\\nbut there?--Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Form two and two!  Let\\'s make a General of him!  Ho, where\\'s his\\r\\nharpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a\\r\\ngame cock now to sit upon his head and crow!  Queequeg dies\\r\\ngame!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that;\\r\\nQueequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he\\r\\ndied a coward; died all a\\'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find\\r\\nPip, tell all the Antilles he\\'s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a\\r\\ncoward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat!  I\\'d never beat my\\r\\ntambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more\\r\\ndying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--shame upon them!  Let \\'em\\r\\ngo drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.  Shame! shame!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.\\r\\nPip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\\r\\nthat his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;\\r\\nsoon there seemed no need of the carpenter\\'s box: and thereupon,\\r\\nwhen some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\\r\\nthat the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\\r\\nmoment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\\r\\nleaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\\r\\ncould not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\\r\\nor die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\\r\\nanswered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg\\'s conceit, that if a\\r\\nman made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\\r\\nnothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\\r\\nunintelligent destroyer of that sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and\\r\\ncivilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months\\r\\nconvalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well\\r\\nagain in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at\\r\\nlength after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but\\r\\neating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\\r\\nthrew out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned\\r\\na little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,\\r\\nand poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\\r\\nemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.\\r\\nMany spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\\r\\ngrotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\\r\\nstriving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\\r\\nhis body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed\\r\\nprophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had\\r\\nwritten out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the\\r\\nearth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that\\r\\nQueequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous\\r\\nwork in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,\\r\\nthough his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were\\r\\ntherefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living\\r\\nparchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the\\r\\nlast.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab\\r\\nthat wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from\\r\\nsurveying poor Queequeg--\"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 111\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great\\r\\nSouth Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear\\r\\nPacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my\\r\\nyouth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a\\r\\nthousand leagues of blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose\\r\\ngently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath;\\r\\nlike those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried\\r\\nEvangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,\\r\\nwide-rolling watery prairies and Potters\\' Fields of all four\\r\\ncontinents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow\\r\\nunceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned\\r\\ndreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,\\r\\nlie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;\\r\\nthe ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,\\r\\nmust ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost\\r\\nwaters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its\\r\\narms.  The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian\\r\\ntowns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave\\r\\nthe faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than\\r\\nAbraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and\\r\\nlow-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.\\r\\nThus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world\\'s whole bulk\\r\\nabout; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart\\r\\nof earth.  Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the\\r\\nseductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab\\'s brain, as standing like an\\r\\niron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with\\r\\none nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee\\r\\nisles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with\\r\\nthe other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;\\r\\nthat sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.\\r\\nLaunched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding\\r\\ntowards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man\\'s purpose\\r\\nintensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the\\r\\nDelta of his forehead\\'s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his\\r\\nvery sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, \"Stern all!\\r\\nthe White Whale spouts thick blood!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 112\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blacksmith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned\\r\\nin these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active\\r\\npursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered\\r\\nold blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,\\r\\nafter concluding his contributory work for Ahab\\'s leg, but still\\r\\nretained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being\\r\\nnow almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and\\r\\nbowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or\\r\\nnew shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.  Often he would\\r\\nbe surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding\\r\\nboat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching\\r\\nhis every sooty movement, as he toiled.  Nevertheless, this old man\\'s\\r\\nwas a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no\\r\\nimpatience, no petulance did come from him.  Silent, slow, and\\r\\nsolemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he\\r\\ntoiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of\\r\\nhis hammer the heavy beating of his heart.  And so it was.--Most\\r\\nmiserable!\\r\\n\\r\\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful\\r\\nappearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage\\r\\nexcited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity of\\r\\ntheir persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came\\r\\nto pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched\\r\\nfate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter\\'s midnight, on the\\r\\nroad running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly\\r\\nfelt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a\\r\\nleaning, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the\\r\\nextremities of both feet.  Out of this revelation, part by part, at\\r\\nlast came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as\\r\\nyet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life\\'s drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\\r\\nencountered that thing in sorrow\\'s technicals called ruin.  He had\\r\\nbeen an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a\\r\\nhouse and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife,\\r\\nand three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a\\r\\ncheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.  But one night, under\\r\\ncover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning\\r\\ndisguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and\\r\\nrobbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to tell, the\\r\\nblacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his\\r\\nfamily\\'s heart.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of\\r\\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.\\r\\nNow, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith\\'s\\r\\nshop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate\\r\\nentrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife\\r\\nlistened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to\\r\\nthe stout ringing of her young-armed old husband\\'s hammer; whose\\r\\nreverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came\\r\\nup to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor\\'s\\r\\niron lullaby, the blacksmith\\'s infants were rocked to slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?\\r\\nHadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin\\r\\ncame upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and\\r\\nher orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their\\r\\nafter years; and all of them a care-killing competency.  But Death\\r\\nplucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily\\r\\ntoil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left\\r\\nthe worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life\\r\\nshould make him easier to harvest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew\\r\\nmore and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the\\r\\nlast; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,\\r\\nglitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the\\r\\nbellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;\\r\\nthe mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children\\r\\ntwice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man\\r\\nstaggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his\\r\\ngrey head a scorn to flaxen curls!\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but\\r\\nDeath is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it\\r\\nis but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense\\r\\nRemote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the\\r\\ndeath-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some\\r\\ninterior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and\\r\\nall-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of\\r\\nunimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and\\r\\nfrom the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to\\r\\nthem--\"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the\\r\\nguilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without\\r\\ndying for them.  Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your\\r\\nnow equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious\\r\\nthan death.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the\\r\\nchurchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by\\r\\nfall of eve, the blacksmith\\'s soul responded, Aye, I come!  And so\\r\\nPerth went a-whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 113\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Forge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\\r\\nmid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter\\r\\nplaced upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in\\r\\nthe coals, and with the other at his forge\\'s lungs, when Captain Ahab\\r\\ncame along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.\\r\\nWhile yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till\\r\\nat last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering\\r\\nit upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick\\r\\nhovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are these thy Mother Carey\\'s chickens, Perth? they are always flying\\r\\nin thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,\\r\\nthey burn; but thou--thou liv\\'st among them without a scorch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,\" answered Perth,\\r\\nresting for a moment on his hammer; \"I am past scorching; not easily\\r\\ncan\\'st thou scorch a scar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely\\r\\nwoeful to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in\\r\\nothers that is not mad.  Thou should\\'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why\\r\\ndost thou not go mad?  How can\\'st thou endure without being mad?  Do\\r\\nthe heavens yet hate thee, that thou can\\'st not go mad?--What wert\\r\\nthou making there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can\\'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such\\r\\nhard usage as it had?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think so, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I suppose thou can\\'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never\\r\\nmind how hard the metal, blacksmith?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look ye here, then,\" cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning\\r\\nwith both hands on Perth\\'s shoulders; \"look ye here--HERE--can ye\\r\\nsmoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,\" sweeping one hand across\\r\\nhis ribbed brow; \"if thou could\\'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I\\r\\nlay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my\\r\\neyes.  Answer!  Can\\'st thou smoothe this seam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\\r\\nthough thou only see\\'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\\r\\nthe bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, away with child\\'s\\r\\nplay; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye here!\" jingling the\\r\\nleathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.  \"I, too, want a\\r\\nharpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part,\\r\\nPerth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.\\r\\nThere\\'s the stuff,\" flinging the pouch upon the anvil.  \"Look ye,\\r\\nblacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of\\r\\nracing horses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,\\r\\nthe best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from\\r\\nthe melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.  And\\r\\nforge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and\\r\\nhammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a\\r\\ntow-line.  Quick!  I\\'ll blow the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,\\r\\nby spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.\\r\\n\"A flaw!\" rejecting the last one.  \"Work that over again, Perth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\\r\\nAhab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  As, then,\\r\\nwith regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing\\r\\nto him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed\\r\\nforge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed\\r\\nsilently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking\\r\\nsome curse or some blessing on the toil.  But, as Ahab looked up, he\\r\\nslid aside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\" muttered\\r\\nStubb, looking on from the forecastle.  \"That Parsee smells fire like\\r\\na fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket\\'s powder-pan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and\\r\\nas Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water\\r\\nnear by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab\\'s bent face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would\\'st thou brand me, Perth?\" wincing for a moment with the pain;\\r\\n\"have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this\\r\\nharpoon for the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make them\\r\\nthyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make\\r\\nthe barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would\\r\\nfain not use them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,\\r\\nsup, nor pray till--but here--to work!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\\r\\nshank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\\r\\nblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\\r\\ntempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.\\r\\nAhoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will\\r\\nye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?\" holding it high\\r\\nup.  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made\\r\\nin the heathen flesh, and the White Whale\\'s barbs were then tempered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\"\\r\\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured\\r\\nthe baptismal blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\\r\\nhickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\\r\\nsocket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and\\r\\nsome fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great\\r\\ntension.  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a\\r\\nharp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings,\\r\\nAhab exclaimed, \"Good! and now for the seizings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread\\r\\nyarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the\\r\\npole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the\\r\\nrope was traced half-way along the pole\\'s length, and firmly secured\\r\\nso, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and\\r\\nrope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily\\r\\nstalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the\\r\\nsound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.\\r\\nBut ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet\\r\\nmost piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy\\r\\nidle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly\\r\\nblended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 114\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gilder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese\\r\\ncruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.\\r\\nOften, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and\\r\\ntwenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily\\r\\npulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an\\r\\ninterlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising;\\r\\nthough with but small success for their pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\\r\\nheaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\\r\\nsociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like\\r\\nhearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times\\r\\nof dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy\\r\\nof the ocean\\'s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath\\r\\nit; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but\\r\\nconceals a remorseless fang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\\r\\ncertain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\\r\\nregards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\\r\\nonly the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through\\r\\nhigh rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:\\r\\nas when the western emigrants\\' horses only show their erected ears,\\r\\nwhile their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\\r\\nthere steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\\r\\nchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when\\r\\nthe flowers of the woods are plucked.  And all this mixes with your\\r\\nmost mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,\\r\\ninterpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as\\r\\ntemporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden keys did\\r\\nseem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his\\r\\nbreath upon them prove but tarnishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\\r\\nye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy\\r\\nlife,--in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning\\r\\nclover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the\\r\\nlife immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.\\r\\nBut the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof:\\r\\ncalms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.  There is no steady\\r\\nunretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed\\r\\ngradations, and at the last one pause:--through infancy\\'s unconscious\\r\\nspell, boyhood\\'s thoughtless faith, adolescence\\' doubt (the common\\r\\ndoom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood\\'s\\r\\npondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round\\r\\nagain; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.  Where lies\\r\\nthe final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?  In what rapt ether sails\\r\\nthe world, of which the weariest will never weary?  Where is the\\r\\nfoundling\\'s father hidden?  Our souls are like those orphans whose\\r\\nunwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity\\r\\nlies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat\\'s side into\\r\\nthat same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride\\'s\\r\\neye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping\\r\\ncannibal ways.  Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look\\r\\ndeep down and do believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same\\r\\ngolden light:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths\\r\\nthat he has always been jolly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 115\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Bachelor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing\\r\\ndown before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab\\'s harpoon had been\\r\\nwelded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\\r\\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\\r\\nglad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\\r\\nsailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground,\\r\\nprevious to pointing her prow for home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\\r\\nbunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\\r\\nbottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\\r\\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns, and\\r\\njacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.\\r\\nSideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels\\r\\nof sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender\\r\\nbreakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was\\r\\na brazen lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\\r\\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising\\r\\nin the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months\\r\\nwithout securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef and\\r\\nbread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm,\\r\\nbut additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the\\r\\nships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the\\r\\ncaptain\\'s and officers\\' state-rooms.  Even the cabin table itself\\r\\nhad been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the\\r\\nbroad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a\\r\\ncentrepiece.  In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked\\r\\nand pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,\\r\\nthat the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled\\r\\nit; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;\\r\\nthat the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled\\r\\nthem; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the\\r\\ncaptain\\'s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his\\r\\nhands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\\r\\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and\\r\\ndrawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her\\r\\nhuge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach\\r\\nskin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\\r\\nclenched hands of the crew.  On the quarter-deck, the mates and\\r\\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped\\r\\nwith them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an\\r\\nornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and\\r\\nmainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of\\r\\nwhale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.  Meanwhile,\\r\\nothers of the ship\\'s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of\\r\\nthe try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.  You would\\r\\nhave almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such\\r\\nwild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were\\r\\nbeing hurled into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\\r\\nship\\'s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\\r\\nfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\\r\\ndiversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\\r\\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\\'s\\r\\nwakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all\\r\\nforebodings as to things to come--their two captains in themselves\\r\\nimpersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come aboard, come aboard!\" cried the gay Bachelor\\'s commander,\\r\\nlifting a glass and a bottle in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\" gritted Ahab in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; only heard of him; but don\\'t believe in him at all,\" said the\\r\\nother good-humoredly.  \"Come aboard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that\\'s all;--but come aboard,\\r\\nold hearty, come along.  I\\'ll soon take that black from your brow.\\r\\nCome along, will ye (merry\\'s the play); a full ship and\\r\\nhomeward-bound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How wondrous familiar is a fool!\" muttered Ahab; then aloud, \"Thou\\r\\nart a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me\\r\\nan empty ship, and outward-bound.  So go thy ways, and I will mine.\\r\\nForward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the\\r\\nother stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;\\r\\nthe crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards\\r\\nthe receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor\\'s men never heeding their\\r\\ngaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over\\r\\nthe taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a\\r\\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,\\r\\nseemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that\\r\\nvial was filled with Nantucket soundings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 116\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dying Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\\'s favourites\\r\\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\\r\\nrushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.  So\\r\\nseemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering the gay\\r\\nBachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by\\r\\nAhab.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\\r\\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and\\r\\nsky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness\\r\\nand such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that\\r\\nrosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green\\r\\nconvent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,\\r\\nwantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper\\r\\nhymns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had\\r\\nsterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings\\r\\nfrom the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in\\r\\nall sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so\\r\\nexpiring--that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening,\\r\\nsomehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\\r\\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.  He\\r\\ntoo worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the\\r\\nsun!--Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring\\r\\nsights.  Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal\\r\\nor woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions\\r\\nno rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows\\r\\nhave still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine\\r\\nupon the Niger\\'s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full\\r\\nof faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the\\r\\ncorpse, and it heads some other way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast\\r\\nbuilded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these\\r\\nunverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly\\r\\nspeakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed\\r\\nburial of its after calm.  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his\\r\\ndying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,\\r\\nrainbowed jet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!  In\\r\\nvain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening\\r\\nsun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.  Yet dost\\r\\nthou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.  All\\r\\nthy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by\\r\\nbreaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\\r\\nfowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;\\r\\nthough hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my\\r\\nfoster-brothers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 117\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to\\r\\nwindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern.\\r\\nThese last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the\\r\\nwindward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had\\r\\nkilled it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale\\'s spout-hole;\\r\\nand the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering\\r\\nglare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight\\r\\nwaves, which gently chafed the whale\\'s broad flank, like soft surf\\r\\nupon a beach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab and all his boat\\'s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\\r\\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\\r\\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.\\r\\nA sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\\r\\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\\r\\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a\\r\\nflooded world.  \"I have dreamed it again,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of the hearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\\r\\ncoffin can be thine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\\r\\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by\\r\\nmortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in\\r\\nAmerica.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes\\r\\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers.  Ha!\\r\\nSuch a sight we shall not soon see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what was that saying about thyself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I\\r\\ncan follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it\\r\\nnot so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have\\r\\nhere two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take another pledge, old man,\" said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted\\r\\nup like fire-flies in the gloom--\"Hemp only can kill thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,\"\\r\\ncried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--\"Immortal on land and on sea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on, and the\\r\\nslumbering crew arose from the boat\\'s bottom, and ere noon the dead\\r\\nwhale was brought to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 118\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quadrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\\r\\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman\\r\\nwould ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners\\r\\nquickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes\\r\\ncentrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to\\r\\npoint the ship\\'s prow for the equator.  In good time the order came.\\r\\nIt was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his\\r\\nhigh-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of\\r\\nthe sun to determine his latitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\\r\\neffulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\\r\\nfocus of the glassy ocean\\'s immeasurable burning-glass.  The sky\\r\\nlooks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\\r\\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\\r\\nGod\\'s throne.  Well that Ahab\\'s quadrant was furnished with coloured\\r\\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire.  So,\\r\\nswinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\\r\\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in\\r\\nthat posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the\\r\\nsun should gain its precise meridian.  Meantime while his whole\\r\\nattention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the\\r\\nship\\'s deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab\\'s, was eyeing the same\\r\\nsun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and\\r\\nhis wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.  At length\\r\\nthe desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory\\r\\nleg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise\\r\\ninstant.  Then falling into a moment\\'s revery, he again looked up\\r\\ntowards the sun and murmured to himself: \"Thou sea-mark! thou high\\r\\nand mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou\\r\\ncast the least hint where I SHALL be?  Or canst thou tell where some\\r\\nother thing besides me is this moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?\\r\\nThis instant thou must be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into\\r\\nthe very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye\\r\\nthat is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,\\r\\nthither side of thee, thou sun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\\r\\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\\r\\n\"Foolish toy! babies\\' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\\r\\nand Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\\r\\nwhat after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\\r\\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\\r\\nholds thee: no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop\\r\\nof water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with\\r\\nthy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee, thou\\r\\nvain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man\\'s eyes aloft to\\r\\nthat heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes\\r\\nare even now scorched with thy light, O sun!  Level by nature to this\\r\\nearth\\'s horizon are the glances of man\\'s eyes; not shot from the\\r\\ncrown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.\\r\\nCurse thee, thou quadrant!\" dashing it to the deck, \"no longer will I\\r\\nguide my earthly way by thee; the level ship\\'s compass, and the level\\r\\ndeadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall conduct me, and show\\r\\nme my place on the sea.  Aye,\" lighting from the boat to the deck,\\r\\n\"thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on\\r\\nhigh; thus I split and destroy thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and\\r\\ndead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\\r\\nfatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over\\r\\nthe mute, motionless Parsee\\'s face.  Unobserved he rose and glided\\r\\naway; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen\\r\\nclustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing\\r\\nthe deck, shouted out--\"To the braces!  Up helm!--square in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled\\r\\nupon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised\\r\\nupon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting\\r\\non one sufficient steed.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod\\'s\\r\\ntumultuous way, and Ahab\\'s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\\r\\nof its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\\r\\ndown, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\\r\\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye,\" cried Stubb, \"but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well; I heard\\r\\nAhab mutter, \\'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands\\r\\nof mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.\\'  And damn me,\\r\\nAhab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 119\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\\r\\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.  Skies the most\\r\\neffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\\r\\ntornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.  So, too, it is, that\\r\\nin these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst\\r\\nof all storms, the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that\\r\\ncloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\\r\\nbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\\r\\nahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\\r\\nthunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled\\r\\nmasts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of\\r\\nthe tempest had left for its after sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at\\r\\nevery flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional\\r\\ndisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb\\r\\nand Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer\\r\\nlashing of the boats.  But all their pains seemed naught.  Though\\r\\nlifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat\\r\\n(Ahab\\'s) did not escape.  A great rolling sea, dashing high up\\r\\nagainst the reeling ship\\'s high teetering side, stove in the boat\\'s\\r\\nbottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a\\r\\nsieve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck,\" said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\\r\\n\"but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can\\'t fight it.  You\\r\\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it\\r\\nleaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But\\r\\nas for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck\\r\\nhere.  But never mind; it\\'s all in fun: so the old song\\r\\nsays;\"--(SINGS.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! jolly is the gale,\\r\\nAnd a joker is the whale,\\r\\nA\\' flourishin\\' his tail,--\\r\\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scud all a flyin\\',\\r\\nThat\\'s his flip only foamin\\';\\r\\nWhen he stirs in the spicin\\',--\\r\\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder splits the ships,\\r\\nBut he only smacks his lips,\\r\\nA tastin\\' of this flip,--\\r\\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast Stubb,\" cried Starbuck, \"let the Typhoon sing, and strike his\\r\\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\\r\\nthy peace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a\\r\\ncoward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.  And I tell you what it is,\\r\\nMr. Starbuck, there\\'s no way to stop my singing in this world but to\\r\\ncut my throat.  And when that\\'s done, ten to one I sing ye the\\r\\ndoxology for a wind-up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,\\r\\nnever mind how foolish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here!\" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing\\r\\nhis hand towards the weather bow, \"markest thou not that the gale\\r\\ncomes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby\\r\\nDick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat\\r\\nthere; where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is\\r\\nwont to stand--his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard,\\r\\nand sing away, if thou must!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t half understand ye: what\\'s in the wind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\\r\\nNantucket,\" soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\\'s\\r\\nquestion.  \"The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn\\r\\nit into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to\\r\\nwindward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see\\r\\nit lightens up there; but not with the lightning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,\\r\\nfollowing the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at\\r\\nthe same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Thunder!\" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\\r\\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by\\r\\nelbowed lances of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry\\r\\noff the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea\\r\\nsome ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the\\r\\nwater.  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,\\r\\nthat its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if\\r\\nkept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,\\r\\nbesides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more\\r\\nor less impeding the vessel\\'s way in the water; because of all this,\\r\\nthe lower parts of a ship\\'s lightning-rods are not always overboard;\\r\\nbut are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more\\r\\nreadily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the\\r\\nsea, as occasion may require.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rods! the rods!\" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\\r\\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\\r\\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post.  \"Are they overboard? drop them\\r\\nover, fore and aft.  Quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried Ahab; \"let\\'s have fair play here, though we be the\\r\\nweaker side.  Yet I\\'ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\\r\\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let\\r\\nthem be, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look aloft!\" cried Starbuck.  \"The corpusants! the corpusants!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\\r\\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each\\r\\nof the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,\\r\\nlike three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blast the boat! let it go!\" cried Stubb at this instant, as a\\r\\nswashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its\\r\\ngunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.\\r\\n\"Blast it!\"--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes\\r\\ncaught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--\"The\\r\\ncorpusants have mercy on us all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance\\r\\nof the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate\\r\\ncurses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a\\r\\nseething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common\\r\\noath when God\\'s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His\\r\\n\"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin\" has been woven into the shrouds and the\\r\\ncordage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from\\r\\nthe enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,\\r\\nall their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\\r\\nconstellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light, the\\r\\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\\r\\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.  The parted\\r\\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\\r\\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\\r\\nthe preternatural light, Queequeg\\'s tattooing burned like Satanic\\r\\nblue flames on his body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once\\r\\nmore the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.\\r\\nA moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against\\r\\nsome one.  It was Stubb.  \"What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy\\r\\ncry; it was not the same in the song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, it wasn\\'t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\\r\\nhope they will, still.  But do they only have mercy on long\\r\\nfaces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?  And look ye, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck--but it\\'s too dark to look.  Hear me, then: I take that\\r\\nmast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are\\r\\nrooted in a hold that is going to be chock a\\' block with sperm-oil,\\r\\nd\\'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like\\r\\nsap in a tree.  Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti\\r\\ncandles--that\\'s the good promise we saw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb\\'s face slowly beginning\\r\\nto glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried: \"See! see!\" and\\r\\nonce more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed\\r\\nredoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The corpusants have mercy on us all,\" cried Stubb, again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the\\r\\nflame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab\\'s front, but with his head\\r\\nbowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging\\r\\nrigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number\\r\\nof the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung\\r\\npendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.\\r\\nIn various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or\\r\\nrunning skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;\\r\\nbut all their eyes upcast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, men!\" cried Ahab.  \"Look up at it; mark it well; the white\\r\\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me those mainmast\\r\\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\\r\\nit; blood against fire!  So.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his\\r\\nfoot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right\\r\\narm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\\r\\nonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that\\r\\nto this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and\\r\\nI now know that thy right worship is defiance.  To neither love nor\\r\\nreverence wilt thou be kind; and e\\'en for hate thou canst but kill;\\r\\nand all are killed.  No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy\\r\\nspeechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake\\r\\nlife will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.  In the\\r\\nmidst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.\\r\\nThough but a point at best; whencesoe\\'er I came; wheresoe\\'er I go;\\r\\nyet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and\\r\\nfeels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in\\r\\nthy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy\\r\\nhighest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest\\r\\nnavies of full-freighted worlds, there\\'s that in here that still\\r\\nremains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest\\r\\nme, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP\\r\\nLENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,\\r\\nCLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?  Nor was it\\r\\nwrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.  Thou canst blind; but\\r\\nI can then grope.  Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.  Take\\r\\nthe homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.  I would not take\\r\\nit.  The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and\\r\\nache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some\\r\\nstunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.\\r\\nLight though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness\\r\\nleaping out of light, leaping out of thee!  The javelins cease; open\\r\\neyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!  Oh, thou magnanimous! now\\r\\nI do glory in my genealogy.  But thou art but my fiery father; my\\r\\nsweet mother, I know not.  Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?\\r\\nThere lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how\\r\\ncame ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy\\r\\nbeginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me, which\\r\\nthou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.  There is some\\r\\nunsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy\\r\\neternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through thee,\\r\\nthy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.  Oh, thou\\r\\nfoundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy\\r\\nincommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.  Here again with\\r\\nhaughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I\\r\\nleap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee;\\r\\ndefyingly I worship thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The boat! the boat!\" cried Starbuck, \"look at thy boat, old man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab\\'s harpoon, the one forged at Perth\\'s fire, remained firmly\\r\\nlashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his\\r\\nwhale-boat\\'s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused\\r\\nthe loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb\\r\\nthere now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.  As the silent\\r\\nharpoon burned there like a serpent\\'s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab\\r\\nby the arm--\"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! \\'tis an\\r\\nill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while\\r\\nwe may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a\\r\\nbetter voyage than this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\\r\\nbraces--though not a sail was left aloft.  For the moment all the\\r\\naghast mate\\'s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous\\r\\ncry.  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and\\r\\nsnatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;\\r\\nswearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a\\r\\nrope\\'s end.  Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from\\r\\nthe fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab\\r\\nagain spoke:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\\r\\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.  And that\\r\\nye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow\\r\\nout the last fear!\"  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished\\r\\nthe flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood\\r\\nof some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render\\r\\nit so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for\\r\\nthunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab\\'s many of the mariners\\r\\ndid run from him in a terror of dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 120\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAHAB STANDING BY THE HELM.  STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir.  The band is working\\r\\nloose and the lee lift is half-stranded.  Shall I strike it, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike nothing; lash it.  If I had sky-sail poles, I\\'d sway them up\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir!--in God\\'s name!--sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The anchors are working, sir.  Shall I get them inboard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything.  The wind\\r\\nrises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet.  Quick, and see\\r\\nto it.--By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper\\r\\nof some coasting smack.  Send down my main-top-sail yard!  Ho,\\r\\ngluepots!  Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this\\r\\nbrain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.  Shall I strike\\r\\nthat?  Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest\\r\\ntime.  What a hooroosh aloft there!  I would e\\'en take it for\\r\\nsublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.  Oh, take\\r\\nmedicine, take medicine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 121\\r\\n\\r\\nMidnight.--The Forecastle Bulwarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER\\r\\nTHE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but\\r\\nyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying.  And how\\r\\nlong ago is it since you said the very contrary?  Didn\\'t you once say\\r\\nthat whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something\\r\\nextra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with\\r\\npowder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn\\'t\\r\\nyou say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, suppose I did?  What then?  I\\'ve part changed my flesh since\\r\\nthat time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with\\r\\npowder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the\\r\\nlucifers get afire in this drenching spray here?  Why, my little man,\\r\\nyou have pretty red hair, but you couldn\\'t get afire now.  Shake\\r\\nyourself; you\\'re Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill\\r\\npitchers at your coat collar.  Don\\'t you see, then, that for these\\r\\nextra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?\\r\\nHere are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I\\'ll answer ye the\\r\\nother thing.  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor\\r\\nhere, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.  What\\'s the mighty\\r\\ndifference between holding a mast\\'s lightning-rod in the storm, and\\r\\nstanding close by a mast that hasn\\'t got any lightning-rod at all in\\r\\na storm?  Don\\'t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to\\r\\nthe holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?  What are you\\r\\ntalking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and\\r\\nAhab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my\\r\\npoor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing\\r\\nthe seas.  Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every\\r\\nman in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the\\r\\ncorner of his hat, like a militia officer\\'s skewered feather, and\\r\\ntrailing behind like his sash.  Why don\\'t ye be sensible, Flask? it\\'s\\r\\neasy to be sensible; why don\\'t ye, then? any man with half an eye can\\r\\nbe sensible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, when a fellow\\'s soaked through, it\\'s hard to be sensible,\\r\\nthat\\'s a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;\\r\\ncatch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down\\r\\nthese anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.\\r\\nTying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man\\'s hands\\r\\nbehind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.  These\\r\\nare your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!  I wonder,\\r\\nFlask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings\\r\\nwith an uncommon long cable, though.  There, hammer that knot down,\\r\\nand we\\'ve done.  So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the\\r\\nmost satisfactory.  I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?\\r\\nThank ye.  They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a\\r\\nLong tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.  The\\r\\ntails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d\\'ye see.\\r\\nSame with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.\\r\\nNo more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a\\r\\nswallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.  Halloa! whew! there goes\\r\\nmy tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from\\r\\nheaven should be so unmannerly!  This is a nasty night, lad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 122\\r\\n\\r\\nMidnight Aloft.--Thunder and Lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAIN-TOP-SAIL YARD.--TASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND IT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Um, um, um.  Stop that thunder!  Plenty too much thunder up here.\\r\\nWhat\\'s the use of thunder?  Um, um, um.  We don\\'t want thunder; we\\r\\nwant rum; give us a glass of rum.  Um, um, um!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 123\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Musket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the\\r\\nPequod\\'s jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to\\r\\nthe deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had\\r\\nbeen attached to it--for they were slack--because some play to the\\r\\ntiller was indispensable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed\\r\\nshuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the\\r\\nneedles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.  It was\\r\\nthus with the Pequod\\'s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not\\r\\nfailed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon\\r\\nthe cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some\\r\\nsort of unwonted emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through\\r\\nthe strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward\\r\\nand the other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and\\r\\nmain-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away\\r\\nto leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are\\r\\ncast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\\r\\nstorm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through\\r\\nthe water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,\\r\\nEast-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\\r\\ngiven to the helmsman.  For during the violence of the gale, he had\\r\\nonly steered according to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now\\r\\nbringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the\\r\\ncompass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round\\r\\nastern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \"HO! THE FAIR\\r\\nWIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!\" the crew singing for joy, that so\\r\\npromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\\r\\npreceding it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report\\r\\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided\\r\\nchange in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed\\r\\nthe yards to the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he\\r\\nmechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a\\r\\nmoment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was\\r\\nburning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man\\'s\\r\\nbolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of\\r\\nupper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a\\r\\ncertain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by\\r\\nall the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack were\\r\\nshiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward\\r\\nbulkhead.  Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck\\'s\\r\\nheart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely\\r\\nevolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good\\r\\naccompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would have shot me once,\" he murmured, \"yes, there\\'s the very\\r\\nmusket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let\\r\\nme touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have handled so many\\r\\ndeadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.  Loaded?  I must\\r\\nsee.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--that\\'s not good.  Best spill\\r\\nit?--wait.  I\\'ll cure myself of this.  I\\'ll hold the musket boldly\\r\\nwhile I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him.  But how fair?\\r\\nFair for death and doom,--THAT\\'S fair for Moby Dick.  It\\'s a fair\\r\\nwind that\\'s only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he\\r\\npointed at me!--the very one; THIS one--I hold it here; he would have\\r\\nkilled me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain\\r\\nkill all his crew.  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to\\r\\nany gale?  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same\\r\\nperilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the\\r\\nerror-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that\\r\\nhe would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old man be\\r\\ntamely suffered to drag a whole ship\\'s company down to doom with\\r\\nhim?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and\\r\\nmore, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm,\\r\\nmy soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he\\r\\nwere this instant--put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he\\r\\nmuttering in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he\\'s sleeping.\\r\\nSleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.  I can\\'t\\r\\nwithstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not\\r\\nentreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.  Flat\\r\\nobedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.  Aye,\\r\\nand say\\'st the men have vow\\'d thy vow; say\\'st all of us are Ahabs.\\r\\nGreat God forbid!--But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make\\r\\nhim a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man\\'s\\r\\nliving power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.\\r\\nSay he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;\\r\\nchained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more\\r\\nhideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could not endure the sight;\\r\\ncould not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,\\r\\ninestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.\\r\\nWhat, then, remains?  The land is hundreds of leagues away, and\\r\\nlocked Japan the nearest.  I stand alone here upon an open sea, with\\r\\ntwo oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, \\'tis\\r\\nso.--Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be\\r\\nmurderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I\\r\\nbe a murderer, then, if\"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways\\r\\nlooking, he placed the loaded musket\\'s end against the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On this level, Ahab\\'s hammock swings within; his head this way.  A\\r\\ntouch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh\\r\\nMary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old\\r\\nman, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck\\'s body this day\\r\\nweek may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall\\r\\nI? shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and\\r\\nmain topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man\\'s\\r\\ntormented sleep, as if Starbuck\\'s voice had caused the long dumb\\r\\ndream to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard\\'s arm against the\\r\\npanel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the\\r\\ndoor, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and\\r\\ntell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know\\'st what to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 124\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Needle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of\\r\\nmighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod\\'s gurgling track, pushed her\\r\\non like giants\\' palms outspread.  The strong, unstaggering breeze\\r\\nabounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the\\r\\nwhole world boomed before the wind.  Muffled in the full morning\\r\\nlight, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of\\r\\nhis place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,\\r\\nas of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.\\r\\nThe sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with\\r\\nlight and heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every\\r\\ntime the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he\\r\\nturned to eye the bright sun\\'s rays produced ahead; and when she\\r\\nprofoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun\\'s\\r\\nrearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his\\r\\nundeviating wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot\\r\\nof the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun\\r\\nto ye!  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the\\r\\nsea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards\\r\\nthe helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"East-sou-east, sir,\" said the frightened steersman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou liest!\" smiting him with his clenched fist.  \"Heading East at\\r\\nthis hour in the morning, and the sun astern?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then\\r\\nobserved by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its\\r\\nvery blinding palpableness must have been the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one\\r\\nglimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment\\r\\nhe almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind him Starbuck looked,\\r\\nand lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as\\r\\ninfallibly going West.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\\r\\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, \"I have it!  It has happened\\r\\nbefore.  Mr. Starbuck, last night\\'s thunder turned our\\r\\ncompasses--that\\'s all.  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I\\r\\ntake it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,\" said the pale\\r\\nmate, gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more\\r\\nthan one case occurred to ships in violent storms.  The magnetic\\r\\nenergy, as developed in the mariner\\'s needle, is, as all know,\\r\\nessentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is\\r\\nnot to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.  Instances\\r\\nwhere the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite\\r\\ndown some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at\\r\\ntimes been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being\\r\\nannihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use\\r\\nthan an old wife\\'s knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle\\r\\nnever again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or\\r\\nlost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate\\r\\nreaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the\\r\\nlowermost one inserted into the kelson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the\\r\\ntranspointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended\\r\\nhand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the\\r\\nneedles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\\'s\\r\\ncourse to be changed accordingly.  The yards were hard up; and once\\r\\nmore the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for\\r\\nthe supposed fair one had only been juggling her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\\r\\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\\r\\nFlask--who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\\r\\nfeelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, though\\r\\nsome of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their\\r\\nfear of Fate.  But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained\\r\\nalmost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a\\r\\ncertain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible\\r\\nAhab\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.  But\\r\\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\\r\\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun\\'s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\\r\\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.  So, so.\\r\\nBut Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a lance\\r\\nwithout a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker\\'s\\r\\nneedles.  Quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now\\r\\nabout to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have\\r\\nbeen to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile\\r\\nskill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.\\r\\nBesides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,\\r\\nthough clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by\\r\\nsuperstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Men,\" said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed\\r\\nhim the things he had demanded, \"my men, the thunder turned old\\r\\nAhab\\'s needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his\\r\\nown, that will point as true as any.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\\r\\nthis was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\\r\\nmight follow.  But Starbuck looked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\\r\\nlance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\\r\\nhim hold it upright, without its touching the deck.  Then, with the\\r\\nmaul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\\r\\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\\r\\nhammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as\\r\\nbefore.  Then going through some small strange motions with\\r\\nit--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely\\r\\nintended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--he called for\\r\\nlinen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two\\r\\nreversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by\\r\\nits middle, over one of the compass-cards.  At first, the steel went\\r\\nround and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last\\r\\nit settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching\\r\\nfor this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing\\r\\nhis stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--\"Look ye, for yourselves,\\r\\nif Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!  The sun is East, and\\r\\nthat compass swears it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes\\r\\ncould persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they\\r\\nslunk away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his\\r\\nfatal pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 125\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Log and Line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the\\r\\nlog and line had but very seldom been in use.  Owing to a confident\\r\\nreliance upon other means of determining the vessel\\'s place, some\\r\\nmerchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly\\r\\nneglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently\\r\\nmore for form\\'s sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon\\r\\nthe customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the\\r\\npresumed average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus\\r\\nwith the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long\\r\\nuntouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.  Rains and\\r\\nspray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the elements\\r\\nhad combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.  But heedless of all\\r\\nthis, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,\\r\\nnot many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his\\r\\nquadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level\\r\\nlog and line.  The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows\\r\\nrolled in riots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forward, there!  Heave the log!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.\\r\\n\"Take the reel, one of ye, I\\'ll heave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship\\'s lee side, where\\r\\nthe deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping\\r\\ninto the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\\r\\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,\\r\\nso stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\\r\\nturns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old\\r\\nManxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\\r\\nspoiled it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled\\r\\nthee?  Thou seem\\'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee;\\r\\nnot thou it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.  With these\\r\\ngrey hairs of mine \\'tis not worth while disputing, \\'specially with a\\r\\nsuperior, who\\'ll ne\\'er confess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?  There now\\'s a patched professor in Queen Nature\\'s\\r\\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he\\'s too subservient.  Where\\r\\nwert thou born?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent!  Thou\\'st hit the world by that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, sir, but I was born there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it\\'s good.  Here\\'s a\\r\\nman from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of\\r\\nMan; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!  The dead, blind\\r\\nwall butts all inquiring heads at last.  Up with it!  So.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a\\r\\nlong dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to\\r\\nwhirl.  In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows,\\r\\nthe towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger\\r\\nstrangely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold hard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\\r\\ntugging log was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\\r\\nsea parts the log-line.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in here,\\r\\nTahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make\\r\\nanother log, and mend thou the line.  See to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There he goes now; to him nothing\\'s happened; but to me, the skewer\\r\\nseems loosening out of the middle of the world.  Haul in, haul in,\\r\\nTahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,\\r\\nand dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whale-boat.  Pip\\'s\\r\\nmissing.  Let\\'s see now if ye haven\\'t fished him up here, fisherman.\\r\\nIt drags hard; I guess he\\'s holding on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him\\r\\noff; we haul in no cowards here.  Ho! there\\'s his arm just breaking\\r\\nwater.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.\\r\\nCaptain Ahab! sir, sir! here\\'s Pip, trying to get on board again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Peace, thou crazy loon,\" cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.\\r\\n\"Away from the quarter-deck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,\" muttered Ahab, advancing.\\r\\n\"Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils\\r\\nof thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls\\r\\nto sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bell-boy, sir; ship\\'s-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One\\r\\nhundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks\\r\\ncowardly--quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who\\'s seen Pip\\r\\nthe coward?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no hearts above the snow-line.  Oh, ye frozen heavens!\\r\\nlook down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned\\r\\nhim, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab\\'s cabin shall be Pip\\'s\\r\\nhome henceforth, while Ahab lives.  Thou touchest my inmost centre,\\r\\nboy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.  Come,\\r\\nlet\\'s down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? here\\'s velvet shark-skin,\" intently gazing at Ahab\\'s\\r\\nhand, and feeling it.  \"Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a\\r\\nthing as this, perhaps he had ne\\'er been lost!  This seems to me,\\r\\nsir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by.

Come, then, to my cabin.  Lo! ye believers in\\r\\ngods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient\\r\\ngods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing\\r\\nnot what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.\\r\\nCome!  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I\\r\\ngrasped an Emperor\\'s!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There go two daft ones now,\" muttered the old Manxman.  \"One daft\\r\\nwith strength, the other daft with weakness.  But here\\'s the end of\\r\\nthe rotten line--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I think we had\\r\\nbest have a new line altogether.  I\\'ll see Mr. Stubb about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 126\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Life-Buoy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab\\'s levelled steel, and her\\r\\nprogress solely determined by Ahab\\'s level log and line; the Pequod\\r\\nheld on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long a passage\\r\\nthrough such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long,\\r\\nsideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously\\r\\nmild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous\\r\\nand desperate scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\r\\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before\\r\\nthe dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then\\r\\nheaded by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\r\\nunearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all\\r\\nHerod\\'s murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their\\r\\nreveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned\\r\\nall transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that\\r\\nwild cry remained within hearing.  The Christian or civilized part of\\r\\nthe crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan\\r\\nharpooneers remained unappalled.  Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest\\r\\nmariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were\\r\\nheard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when\\r\\nhe came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not\\r\\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed, and\\r\\nthus explained the wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\\r\\nnumbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or\\r\\nsome dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and\\r\\nkept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of\\r\\nwail.  But this only the more affected some of them, because most\\r\\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising\\r\\nnot only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from\\r\\nthe human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\\r\\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside.  In the sea, under\\r\\ncertain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\r\\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.  At\\r\\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\\r\\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\\r\\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was\\r\\nthus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,\\r\\nhe had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a\\r\\nrushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\\r\\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where\\r\\nit always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to\\r\\nseize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had\\r\\nshrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also\\r\\nfilled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed\\r\\nthe sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in\\r\\nsooth but a hard one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look\\r\\nout for the White Whale, on the White Whale\\'s own peculiar ground;\\r\\nthat man was swallowed up in the deep.  But few, perhaps, thought of\\r\\nthat at the time.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at\\r\\nthis event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a\\r\\nforeshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an\\r\\nevil already presaged.  They declared that now they knew the reason\\r\\nof those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the\\r\\nold Manxman said nay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to\\r\\nsee to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and\\r\\nas in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of\\r\\nthe voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was\\r\\ndirectly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to\\r\\nbe; therefore, they were going to leave the ship\\'s stern unprovided\\r\\nwith a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg\\r\\nhinted a hint concerning his coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A life-buoy of a coffin!\" cried Starbuck, starting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather queer, that, I should say,\" said Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will make a good enough one,\" said Flask, \"the carpenter here can\\r\\narrange it easily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring it up; there\\'s nothing else for it,\" said Starbuck, after a\\r\\nmelancholy pause.  \"Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the\\r\\ncoffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?\" moving his hand as with a\\r\\nhammer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And shall I caulk the seams, sir?\" moving his hand as with a\\r\\ncaulking-iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?\" moving his hand\\r\\nas with a pitch-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,\\r\\nand no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts he\\r\\nbaulks.  Now I don\\'t like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and\\r\\nhe wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and\\r\\nhe won\\'t put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing\\r\\nwith that coffin?  And now I\\'m ordered to make a life-buoy of it.\\r\\nIt\\'s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other\\r\\nside now.  I don\\'t like this cobbling sort of business--I don\\'t like\\r\\nit at all; it\\'s undignified; it\\'s not my place.  Let tinkers\\' brats\\r\\ndo tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take in hand none but\\r\\nclean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that\\r\\nregularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway,\\r\\nand comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler\\'s job, that\\'s at\\r\\nan end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.  It\\'s the old\\r\\nwoman\\'s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection\\r\\nall old women have for tinkers.  I know an old woman of sixty-five\\r\\nwho ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.  And that\\'s the\\r\\nreason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I\\r\\nkept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their\\r\\nlonely old heads to run off with me.  But heigh-ho! there are no caps\\r\\nat sea but snow-caps.  Let me see.  Nail down the lid; caulk the\\r\\nseams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang\\r\\nit with the snap-spring over the ship\\'s stern.  Were ever such things\\r\\ndone before with a coffin?  Some superstitious old carpenters, now,\\r\\nwould be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.  But I\\'m\\r\\nmade of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don\\'t budge.  Cruppered with a\\r\\ncoffin!  Sailing about with a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We\\r\\nworkers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as\\r\\ncoffins and hearses.  We work by the month, or by the job, or by the\\r\\nprofit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless\\r\\nit be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!\\r\\nI\\'ll do the job, now, tenderly.  I\\'ll have me--let\\'s see--how many in\\r\\nthe ship\\'s company, all told?  But I\\'ve forgotten.  Any way, I\\'ll\\r\\nhave me thirty separate, Turk\\'s-headed life-lines, each three feet\\r\\nlong hanging all round to the coffin.  Then, if the hull go down,\\r\\nthere\\'ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a\\r\\nsight not seen very often beneath the sun!  Come hammer,\\r\\ncaulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!  Let\\'s to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 127\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE\\r\\nOPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF\\r\\nTWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE\\r\\nBOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND\\r\\nHEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBack, lad; I will be with ye again presently.  He goes!  Not this\\r\\nhand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle\\r\\naisle of a church!  What\\'s here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck\\'s orders.  Oh, look, sir!  Beware the\\r\\nhatchway!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it does, sir, so it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Art not thou the leg-maker?  Look, did not this stump come from thy\\r\\nshop?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well enough.  But art thou not also the undertaker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but\\r\\nthey\\'ve set me now to turning it into something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\\r\\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and\\r\\nthe next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of\\r\\nthose same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as\\r\\nmuch of a jack-of-all-trades.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I do not mean anything, sir.  I do as I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gods again.  Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a\\r\\ncoffin?  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the\\r\\ncraters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade\\r\\nin hand.  Dost thou never?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I\\'m indifferent enough, sir, for that;\\r\\nbut the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because\\r\\nthere was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of\\r\\nit.  Hark to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, and that\\'s because the lid there\\'s a sounding-board; and what\\r\\nin all things makes the sounding-board is this--there\\'s naught\\r\\nbeneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the\\r\\nsame, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the\\r\\ncoffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Faith, sir, I\\'ve--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Faith?  What\\'s that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, faith, sir, it\\'s only a sort of exclamation-like--that\\'s all,\\r\\nsir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Um, um; go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was about to say, sir, that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Art thou a silk-worm?  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?\\r\\nLook at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot\\r\\nlatitudes.  I\\'ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the\\r\\nGallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.  Seems to me\\r\\nsome sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.\\r\\nHe\\'s always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!  He\\'s looking this\\r\\nway--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.  This wooden mallet is\\r\\nthe cork, and I\\'m the professor of musical glasses--tap, tap!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a sight!  There\\'s a sound!  The grey-headed woodpecker\\r\\ntapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.\\r\\nSee! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.  A most\\r\\nmalicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat!  So man\\'s seconds tick!  Oh!\\r\\nhow immaterial are all materials!  What things real are there, but\\r\\nimponderable thoughts?  Here now\\'s the very dreaded symbol of grim\\r\\ndeath, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope\\r\\nof most endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go\\r\\nfurther?  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after\\r\\nall, but an immortality-preserver!  I\\'ll think of that.  But no.  So\\r\\nfar gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the\\r\\ntheoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.  Will ye\\r\\nnever have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?  I go below;\\r\\nlet me not see that thing here when I return again.  Now, then, Pip,\\r\\nwe\\'ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee!\\r\\nSome unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 128\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Rachel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly\\r\\ndown upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.  At\\r\\nthe time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as\\r\\nthe broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful\\r\\nsails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all\\r\\nlife fled from the smitten hull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad news; she brings bad news,\" muttered the old Manxman.  But ere\\r\\nher commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere\\r\\nhe could hopefully hail, Ahab\\'s voice was heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected\\r\\nquestion; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the\\r\\nstranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel\\'s way, was seen\\r\\ndescending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon\\r\\nclinched the Pequod\\'s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.\\r\\nImmediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.  But\\r\\nno formal salutation was exchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!\" cried Ahab, closely\\r\\nadvancing.  \"How was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\\r\\nwhile three of the stranger\\'s boats were engaged with a shoal of\\r\\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\\r\\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and\\r\\nhead of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very\\r\\nfar to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--a reserved\\r\\none--had been instantly lowered in chase.  After a keen sail before\\r\\nthe wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to\\r\\nhave succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the\\r\\nmast-head could tell anything about it.  In the distance he saw the\\r\\ndiminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white\\r\\nwater; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the\\r\\nstricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as\\r\\noften happens.  There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,\\r\\nas yet.  The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came\\r\\non; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going\\r\\nin quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--the\\r\\nship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate\\r\\ntill near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from\\r\\nit.  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded\\r\\nall sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a\\r\\nfire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the\\r\\nlook-out.  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance\\r\\nto gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though\\r\\nshe then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and\\r\\nnot finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered\\r\\nher boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;\\r\\nyet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal\\r\\nhis object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite\\r\\nwith his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five\\r\\nmiles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as\\r\\nit were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will wager something now,\" whispered Stubb to Flask, \"that some\\r\\none in that missing boat wore off that Captain\\'s best coat; mayhap,\\r\\nhis watch--he\\'s so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of\\r\\ntwo pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the\\r\\nheight of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he\\r\\nlooks--pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn\\'t the\\r\\ncoat--it must have been the--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God\\'s sake--I beg, I\\r\\nconjure\"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far\\r\\nhad but icily received his petition.  \"For eight-and-forty hours let\\r\\nme charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for\\r\\nit--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only\\r\\nthat--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His son!\" cried Stubb, \"oh, it\\'s his son he\\'s lost!  I take back the\\r\\ncoat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s drowned with the rest on \\'em, last night,\" said the old Manx\\r\\nsailor standing behind them; \"I heard; all of ye heard their\\r\\nspirits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the\\r\\nRachel\\'s the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was\\r\\none of the Captain\\'s sons among the number of the missing boat\\'s\\r\\ncrew; but among the number of the other boat\\'s crews, at the same\\r\\ntime, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark\\r\\nvicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that\\r\\nfor a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the\\r\\ncruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief\\r\\nmate\\'s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship\\r\\nin such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but\\r\\ndivided boats, always to pick up the majority first.  But the\\r\\ncaptain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from\\r\\nmentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab\\'s iciness did\\r\\nhe allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years\\r\\nold, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a\\r\\nNantucketer\\'s paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in\\r\\nthe perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny\\r\\nof all his race.  Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket\\r\\ncaptains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a\\r\\nprotracted three or four years\\' voyage in some other ship than their\\r\\nown; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman\\'s career shall be\\r\\nunenervated by any chance display of a father\\'s natural but untimely\\r\\npartiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of\\r\\nAhab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but\\r\\nwithout the least quivering of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not go,\" said the stranger, \"till you say aye to me.  Do to\\r\\nme as you would have me do to you in the like case.  For YOU too have\\r\\na boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home\\r\\nnow--a child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see\\r\\nit--run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Avast,\" cried Ahab--\"touch not a rope-yarn\"; then in a voice that\\r\\nprolongingly moulded every word--\"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.\\r\\nEven now I lose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bless ye, man, and\\r\\nmay I forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the\\r\\nbinnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn\\r\\noff all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail\\r\\nas before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\\r\\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and\\r\\nutter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But starting from his\\r\\nenchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than\\r\\nstepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange\\r\\nvessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every\\r\\ndark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards\\r\\nwere swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;\\r\\nnow she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;\\r\\nwhile all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with\\r\\nmen, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among\\r\\nthe boughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly\\r\\nsaw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without\\r\\ncomfort.  She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 129\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.  The hour is\\r\\ncoming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have\\r\\nthee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too\\r\\ncuring to my malady.  Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady\\r\\nbecomes my most desired health.  Do thou abide below here, where they\\r\\nshall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt\\r\\nsit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for\\r\\nyour one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I\\r\\nremain a part of ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless\\r\\nfidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks\\r\\nlike-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose\\r\\ndrowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living\\r\\nskin.  But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.  Sir, I\\r\\nmust go with ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab\\'s purpose keels up in\\r\\nhim.  I tell thee no; it cannot be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh good master, master, master!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.\\r\\nListen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and\\r\\nstill know that I am there.  And now I quit thee.  Thy hand!--Met!\\r\\nTrue art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre.  So: God for\\r\\never bless thee; and if it come to that,--God for ever save thee, let\\r\\nwhat will befall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,--but I\\'m alone.\\r\\nNow were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he\\'s missing.\\r\\nPip!  Pip!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who\\'s seen Pip?  He must be up here;\\r\\nlet\\'s try the door.  What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet\\r\\nthere\\'s no opening it.  It must be the spell; he told me to stay\\r\\nhere: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.  Here, then, I\\'ll\\r\\nseat me, against the transom, in the ship\\'s full middle, all her keel\\r\\nand her three masts before me.  Here, our old sailors say, in their\\r\\nblack seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord\\r\\nit over rows of captains and lieutenants.  Ha! what\\'s this? epaulets!\\r\\nepaulets! the epaulets all come crowding!  Pass round the decanters;\\r\\nglad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs!  What an odd feeling, now, when a\\r\\nblack boy\\'s host to white men with gold lace upon their\\r\\ncoats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--a little negro lad, five\\r\\nfeet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!  Jumped from a whale-boat\\r\\nonce;--seen him?  No!  Well then, fill up again, captains, and let\\'s\\r\\ndrink shame upon all cowards!  I name no names.  Shame upon them!\\r\\nPut one foot upon the table.  Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above\\r\\nthere, I hear ivory--Oh, master! master!  I am indeed down-hearted\\r\\nwhen you walk over me.  But here I\\'ll stay, though this stern\\r\\nstrikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 130\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\\r\\npreliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to\\r\\nhave chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely\\r\\nthere; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and\\r\\nlongitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a\\r\\nvessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually\\r\\nencountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with\\r\\nvarious ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac\\r\\nindifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether\\r\\nsinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something\\r\\nin the old man\\'s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble\\r\\nsouls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the\\r\\nlivelong, arctic, six months\\' night sustains its piercing, steady,\\r\\ncentral gaze; so Ahab\\'s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the\\r\\nconstant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,\\r\\nthat all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide\\r\\nbeneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\\r\\nvanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\\r\\nstrove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\\r\\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\\r\\nmortar of Ahab\\'s iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about\\r\\nthe deck, ever conscious that the old man\\'s despot eye was on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;\\r\\nwhen he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have\\r\\nseen that even as Ahab\\'s eyes so awed the crew\\'s, the inscrutable\\r\\nParsee\\'s glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at\\r\\ntimes affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to\\r\\ninvest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;\\r\\nthat the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,\\r\\nwhether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow\\r\\ncast upon the deck by some unseen being\\'s body.  And that shadow was\\r\\nalways hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever\\r\\ncertainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still\\r\\nfor hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did\\r\\nplainly say--We two watchmen never rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon\\r\\nthe deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his\\r\\npivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating\\r\\nlimits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing\\r\\nin the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if\\r\\nto step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however\\r\\nmotionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that\\r\\nhe had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching\\r\\nhat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes\\r\\nwere really closed at times; or whether he was still intently\\r\\nscanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a\\r\\nwhole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in\\r\\nbeads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that\\r\\nthe night had wet, the next day\\'s sunshine dried upon him; and so,\\r\\nday after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the\\r\\nplanks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast\\r\\nand dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which\\r\\ndarkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,\\r\\nwhich still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper\\r\\nverdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;\\r\\nand though the Parsee\\'s mystic watch was without intermission as his\\r\\nown; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the\\r\\nother--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made\\r\\nit necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the\\r\\ntwain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like\\r\\nasunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb\\r\\nmen were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.\\r\\nAt times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far\\r\\nparted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the\\r\\nmainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the\\r\\nParsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his\\r\\nabandoned substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\\r\\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab\\r\\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again\\r\\nboth seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the\\r\\nlean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all\\r\\nrib and keel was solid Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was\\r\\nheard from aft,--\"Man the mast-heads!\"--and all through the day,\\r\\ntill after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at\\r\\nthe striking of the helmsman\\'s bell, was heard--\"What d\\'ye\\r\\nsee?--sharp! sharp!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\\r\\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the\\r\\nmonomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew\\'s fidelity; at\\r\\nleast, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to\\r\\ndoubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the\\r\\nsight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he\\r\\nsagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his\\r\\nactions might seem to hint them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\"--he said.  \"Aye!\\r\\nAhab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest\\r\\nof basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\\r\\nblock, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of\\r\\nthe downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a\\r\\npin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,\\r\\nwith that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\\r\\nround upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his\\r\\nglance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;\\r\\nand then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,\\r\\nsaid,--\"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\"\\r\\nThen arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to\\r\\nhoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope\\r\\nat last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand\\r\\nclinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for\\r\\nmiles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the\\r\\nwide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\\r\\nthe rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea\\r\\nis hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under\\r\\nthese circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in\\r\\nstrict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.\\r\\nBecause in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various\\r\\ndifferent relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by\\r\\nwhat is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these\\r\\nropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it\\r\\nwould be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant\\r\\nwatchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew\\r\\nbe cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab\\'s\\r\\nproceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\\r\\nabout them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\\r\\nhad ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\\r\\napproaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\\r\\nlook-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\\r\\nwas the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his\\r\\nwhole life into such an otherwise distrusted person\\'s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\\r\\nminutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\\r\\nincommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\\r\\nlatitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\\r\\nhead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\\r\\nthousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,\\r\\nand went eddying again round his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\\r\\nnot to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have\\r\\nmarked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost\\r\\nthe least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in\\r\\nalmost every sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your hat, your hat, sir!\" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\\r\\nbeing posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,\\r\\nthough somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air\\r\\ndividing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man\\'s eyes; the long\\r\\nhooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away\\r\\nwith his prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin\\'s head, removing his cap to\\r\\nreplace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin\\r\\nwould be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that\\r\\nomen accounted good.  Ahab\\'s hat was never restored; the wild hawk\\r\\nflew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last\\r\\ndisappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute\\r\\nblack spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 131\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\\r\\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most\\r\\nmiserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.  As she drew nigh, all\\r\\neyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\\r\\nwhaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\\r\\nfeet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the stranger\\'s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\\r\\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but\\r\\nyou now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the\\r\\npeeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look!\" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and\\r\\nwith his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hast killed him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,\" answered the\\r\\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose\\r\\ngathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not forged!\" and snatching Perth\\'s levelled iron from the crotch,\\r\\nAhab held it out, exclaiming--\"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this\\r\\nhand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning\\r\\nare these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place\\r\\nbehind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then God keep thee, old man--see\\'st thou that\"--pointing to the\\r\\nhammock--\"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\\r\\nyesterday; but were dead ere night.  Only THAT one I bury; the rest\\r\\nwere buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.\"  Then\\r\\nturning to his crew--\"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the\\r\\nrail, and lift the body; so, then--Oh!  God\"--advancing towards the\\r\\nhammock with uplifted hands--\"may the resurrection and the life--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brace forward!  Up helm!\" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the\\r\\nsound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;\\r\\nnot so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have\\r\\nsprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy\\r\\nhanging at the Pequod\\'s stern came into conspicuous relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!\" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.\\r\\n\"In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us\\r\\nyour taffrail to show us your coffin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 132\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Symphony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were\\r\\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air\\r\\nwas transparently pure and soft, with a woman\\'s look, and the robust\\r\\nand man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as\\r\\nSamson\\'s chest in his sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\\r\\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\\r\\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\\r\\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\\r\\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades\\r\\nand shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it\\r\\nwere, that distinguished them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle\\r\\nair to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  And at the\\r\\ngirdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen\\r\\nhere at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving\\r\\nalarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly\\r\\nfirm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in\\r\\nthe ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of\\r\\nthe morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl\\'s\\r\\nforehead of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Invisible winged\\r\\ncreatures that frolic all round us!  Sweet childhood of air and sky!\\r\\nhow oblivious were ye of old Ahab\\'s close-coiled woe!  But so have I\\r\\nseen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol\\r\\naround their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which\\r\\ngrew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side\\r\\nand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,\\r\\nthe more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  But\\r\\nthe lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,\\r\\nfor a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad, happy air,\\r\\nthat winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother\\r\\nworld, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round\\r\\nhis stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over\\r\\none, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her\\r\\nheart to save and to bless.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab\\r\\ndropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such\\r\\nwealth as that one wee drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the\\r\\nside; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless\\r\\nsobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  Careful\\r\\nnot to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and\\r\\nstood there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab turned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Starbuck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  On\\r\\nsuch a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first\\r\\nwhale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--forty years\\r\\nago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of\\r\\nprivation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless\\r\\nsea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty\\r\\nyears to make war on the horrors of the deep!  Aye and yes, Starbuck,\\r\\nout of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.  When I think\\r\\nof this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the\\r\\nmasoned, walled-town of a Captain\\'s exclusiveness, which admits but\\r\\nsmall entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh,\\r\\nweariness! heaviness!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary\\r\\ncommand!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so\\r\\nkeenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon\\r\\ndry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when\\r\\nthe poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and\\r\\nbroken the world\\'s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole\\r\\noceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and\\r\\nsailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my\\r\\nmarriage pillow--wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!\\r\\nAye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and\\r\\nthen, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking\\r\\nbrow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,\\r\\nfoamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a\\r\\nforty years\\' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Why this\\r\\nstrife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the\\r\\niron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?  Behold.\\r\\nOh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one\\r\\npoor leg should have been snatched from under me?  Here, brush this\\r\\nold hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did\\r\\nnever grow but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,\\r\\nvery old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as\\r\\nthough I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since\\r\\nParadise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my\\r\\nbrain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have\\r\\nI lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably\\r\\nold?  Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human\\r\\neye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze\\r\\nupon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the\\r\\nmagic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  No, no;\\r\\nstay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab\\r\\ngives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no!\\r\\nnot with the far away home I see in that eye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!\\r\\nwhy should any one give chase to that hated fish!  Away with me! let\\r\\nus fly these deadly waters! let us home!  Wife and child, too, are\\r\\nStarbuck\\'s--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\\r\\nyouth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,\\r\\nlonging, paternal old age!  Away! let us away!--this instant let me\\r\\nalter the course!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would\\r\\nwe bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they\\r\\nhave some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days in the\\r\\nmorning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy\\r\\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\\r\\ncannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come\\r\\nback to dance him again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy, every\\r\\nmorning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of\\r\\nhis father\\'s sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for\\r\\nNantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!\\r\\nSee, see! the boy\\'s face from the window! the boy\\'s hand on the\\r\\nhill!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab\\'s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,\\r\\nand cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what\\r\\ncozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor\\r\\ncommands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep\\r\\npushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly\\r\\nmaking me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst\\r\\nnot so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, that\\r\\nlifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an\\r\\nerrand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some\\r\\ninvisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one\\r\\nsmall brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that\\r\\nthinking, does that living, and not I.  By heaven, man, we are turned\\r\\nround and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the\\r\\nhandspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this\\r\\nunsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase\\r\\nand fang that flying-fish?  Where do murderers go, man!  Who\\'s to\\r\\ndoom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is a\\r\\nmild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as\\r\\nif it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay\\r\\nsomewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are\\r\\nsleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,\\r\\nwe all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid\\r\\ngreenness; as last year\\'s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut\\r\\nswaths--Starbuck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut blanched to a corpse\\'s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at\\r\\ntwo reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Fedallah was\\r\\nmotionlessly leaning over the same rail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 133\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chase--First Day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at\\r\\nintervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and\\r\\nwent to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,\\r\\nsnuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship\\'s dog will, in drawing\\r\\nnigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.\\r\\nSoon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by\\r\\nthe living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any\\r\\nmariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the\\r\\ndog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as\\r\\nnearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\\'s course to be\\r\\nslightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\\r\\nvindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\\r\\ndirectly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\\r\\npleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like\\r\\nmarks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the\\r\\nforecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps\\r\\nthat they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did\\r\\nthey appear with their clothes in their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What d\\'ye see?\" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, nothing sir!\" was the sound hailing down in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"T\\'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\\r\\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they\\r\\nwere hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way\\r\\naloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between\\r\\nthe main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in\\r\\nthe air.  \"There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a\\r\\nsnow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\\r\\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\\r\\nwhale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final\\r\\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\\r\\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian\\'s\\r\\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab\\'s heel.  From this height the\\r\\nwhale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\\r\\nrevealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\\r\\nspout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\\r\\nsilent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and\\r\\nIndian Oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched\\r\\nmen all around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and\\r\\nI cried out,\" said Tashtego.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\\r\\nreserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised\\r\\nthe White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there\\r\\nshe blows!  There again!--there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn,\\r\\nlingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\\r\\nwhale\\'s visible jets.  \"He\\'s going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down\\r\\ntop-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,\\r\\nstay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\\r\\nSo; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!\\r\\nAll ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the air\\r\\nto the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away\\r\\nfrom us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!\\r\\nShiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\\'s were dropped; all the boat-sails\\r\\nset--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\\r\\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up\\r\\nFedallah\\'s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\\r\\nsea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the\\r\\nocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;\\r\\nseemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the\\r\\nbreathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\\r\\nentire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\\r\\nif an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\\r\\nfinest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\\r\\nthe slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft\\r\\nTurkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\\r\\nbroad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\\r\\nshade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\\r\\nthe moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\\r\\nbubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by\\r\\nthe light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\\r\\nalternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff\\r\\nrising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered\\r\\npole of a recent lance projected from the white whale\\'s back; and at\\r\\nintervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and\\r\\nfro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked\\r\\non this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\\r\\ninvested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\\r\\nwith ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\\r\\nleering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\\r\\nfleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not\\r\\nJove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\\r\\nWhale as he so divinely swam.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\\r\\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\\r\\nshed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters\\r\\nwho namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\\r\\nventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\\r\\nvesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou\\r\\nglidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how\\r\\nmany in that same way thou may\\'st have bejuggled and destroyed\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\\r\\namong waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,\\r\\nMoby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of\\r\\nhis submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his\\r\\njaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for\\r\\nan instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like\\r\\nVirginia\\'s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\\r\\nin the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\\r\\nsight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white\\r\\nsea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\\r\\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\\'s\\r\\nreappearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\\'s stern; and he\\r\\ngazed beyond the whale\\'s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\\r\\nwooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\\r\\neyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\\r\\nThe breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\\r\\nnow all flying towards Ahab\\'s boat; and when within a few yards began\\r\\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\\r\\njoyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man\\'s; Ahab\\r\\ncould discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\\r\\nand down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\\r\\nbigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\\r\\nmagnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\\r\\nrevealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\\r\\nup from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick\\'s open mouth and\\r\\nscrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\\r\\nblue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\\r\\nan open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\\r\\nsteering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\\r\\napparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\\r\\nwent forward to the bows, and seizing Perth\\'s harpoon, commanded his\\r\\ncrew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\\r\\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale\\'s head while yet\\r\\nunder water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\\r\\nthat malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\\r\\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\\r\\nlengthwise beneath the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\\r\\nfor an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\\r\\nof a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\\r\\nhis mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\\r\\nup into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\\r\\nbluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\\r\\nAhab\\'s head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\\r\\nWhite Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\\r\\nmouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\\r\\nbut the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\\'s heads to\\r\\ngain the uttermost stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\\r\\nthe whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\\r\\nfrom his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\\r\\ndarted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\\r\\nit were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\\r\\nquick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\\r\\nAhab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\\r\\nhim all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\\r\\nall this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\\r\\nstrove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\\r\\nthe jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\\r\\nsnapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\\r\\nbit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\\r\\nin the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\\r\\naside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\\r\\nto the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\\r\\nacross.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\\r\\nfirst to perceive the whale\\'s intent, by the crafty upraising of his\\r\\nhead, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\\r\\nhis hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\\r\\nBut only slipping further into the whale\\'s mouth, and tilting over\\r\\nsideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\\r\\nspilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\\r\\nflat-faced upon the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\\r\\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\\r\\nthe billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\\r\\nbody; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\\r\\nmore feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\\r\\nconfluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\\r\\ntheir shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\\r\\nbut half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\\r\\nEddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\\r\\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\\r\\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\\r\\npitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must\\r\\nbest and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\\r\\nround and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\\r\\nvengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\\r\\ndeadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\\r\\nhim, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus\\'s\\r\\nelephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\\r\\nthe foam of the whale\\'s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\\r\\nswim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\\r\\nwhirlpool as that; helpless Ahab\\'s head was seen, like a tossed\\r\\nbubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat\\'s\\r\\nfragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\\r\\nclinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\\r\\nthan enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\\r\\nrevolvingly appalling was the White Whale\\'s aspect, and so\\r\\nplanetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\\r\\nseemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\\r\\nunharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\\r\\neddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\\r\\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\\r\\ncase could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,\\r\\nthen, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose\\r\\ncentre had now become the old man\\'s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\\r\\nship\\'s mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon\\r\\nthe scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\\r\\nher!--\"Sail on the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him\\r\\nfrom Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of\\r\\nit again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\\r\\nshouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\\r\\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he\\r\\nsullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nDragged into Stubb\\'s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\\r\\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\\'s bodily\\r\\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body\\'s doom: for\\r\\na time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb\\'s boat, like one\\r\\ntrodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails\\r\\ncame from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\\r\\nmore abbreviate it.  In an instant\\'s compass, great hearts sometimes\\r\\ncondense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\\r\\nkindly diffused through feebler men\\'s whole lives.  And so, such\\r\\nhearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\\r\\ndecree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\\r\\nmade up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\\r\\ncentres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\\r\\ninferior souls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\\r\\none bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lay it before me;--any missing men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here\\r\\nare five men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!\\r\\nthere! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands\\r\\noff from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab\\'s bones again!  Set the\\r\\nsail; out oars; the helm!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\\r\\npicked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\\r\\nchase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It\\r\\nwas thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the\\r\\nadded power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\\r\\nevery fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\\r\\nnow, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\\r\\nindefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\\r\\nendure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining\\r\\nat the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\\r\\nvicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\\r\\nthe most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\\r\\nAccordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to\\r\\ntheir cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\\r\\npreviously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,\\r\\nand stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\\r\\nstun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\\r\\nbore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,\\r\\nmethodic intervals, the whale\\'s glittering spout was regularly\\r\\nannounced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported\\r\\nas just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the\\r\\ndeck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\\r\\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon\\r\\nnow?  D\\'ye see him?\" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he\\r\\ncommanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore\\r\\non; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the\\r\\nplanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\\r\\naloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to\\r\\na still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched\\r\\nhat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been\\r\\ndropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to\\r\\nshattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already\\r\\nover-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,\\r\\nso over the old man\\'s face there now stole some such added gloom as\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\\r\\nevince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place\\r\\nin his Captain\\'s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck\\r\\nexclaimed--\"The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too\\r\\nkeenly, sir; ha! ha!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?  Man, man!\\r\\ndid I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I\\r\\ncould swear thou wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh should be heard\\r\\nbefore a wreck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Starbuck drawing near, \"\\'tis a solemn sight; an\\r\\nomen, and an ill one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright to\\r\\nman, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\\r\\ngive an old wives\\' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are the opposite\\r\\npoles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is\\r\\nStarbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the\\r\\nmillions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!  Cold,\\r\\ncold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!  D\\'ye see him?  Sing out for\\r\\nevery spout, though he spout ten times a second!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was\\r\\nrustling.  Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still\\r\\nremained unset.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t see the spout now, sir;--too dark\"--cried a voice from the\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How heading when last seen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As before, sir,--straight to leeward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good! he will travel slower now \\'tis night.  Down royals and\\r\\ntop-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him\\r\\nbefore morning; he\\'s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.\\r\\nHelm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr.\\r\\nStubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned\\r\\ntill morning.\"--Then advancing towards the doubloon in the\\r\\nmain-mast--\"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let\\r\\nit abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye\\r\\nfirst raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that\\r\\nman\\'s; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times\\r\\nits sum shall be divided among all of ye!  Away now!--the deck is\\r\\nthine, sir!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\\r\\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\\r\\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 134\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chase--Second Day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"D\\'ye see him?\" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the\\r\\nlight to spread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See nothing, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\\r\\nfor;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her\\r\\nall night.  But no matter--\\'tis but resting for the rush.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\\r\\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into day,\\r\\nis a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.  For\\r\\nsuch is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\\r\\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the\\r\\nNantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale\\r\\nwhen last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,\\r\\npretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will\\r\\ncontinue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his\\r\\nprobable rate of progression during that period.  And, in these\\r\\ncases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose\\r\\ngeneral trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to\\r\\nreturn to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands\\r\\nby his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present\\r\\nvisible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\\r\\nheadland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his\\r\\ncompass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently\\r\\nmarked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures\\r\\nthe fish, the creature\\'s future wake through the darkness is almost\\r\\nas established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot\\'s\\r\\ncoast is to him.  So that to this hunter\\'s wondrous skill, the\\r\\nproverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\\r\\ndesired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.  And as\\r\\nthe mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly\\r\\nknown in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time\\r\\nhis rate as doctors that of a baby\\'s pulse; and lightly say of it,\\r\\nthe up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at\\r\\nsuch or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\\r\\nNantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\\r\\nobserved humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours\\r\\nhence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about\\r\\nreached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.  But to render\\r\\nthis acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea\\r\\nmust be the whaleman\\'s allies; for of what present avail to the\\r\\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\\r\\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?  Inferable\\r\\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching\\r\\nthe chase of whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\r\\ncannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\\r\\nfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By salt and hemp!\" cried Stubb, \"but this swift motion of the deck\\r\\ncreeps up one\\'s legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I are\\r\\ntwo brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,\\r\\nspine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine\\'s a keel.  Ha,\\r\\nha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!\" was now the\\r\\nmast-head cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye!\" cried Stubb, \"I knew it--ye can\\'t escape--blow on and\\r\\nsplit your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow\\r\\nyour trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a\\r\\nmiller shuts his watergate upon the stream!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.  The\\r\\nfrenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,\\r\\nlike old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some\\r\\nof them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of\\r\\nsight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and\\r\\non all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the\\r\\nbounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and\\r\\nby the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past\\r\\nnight\\'s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which\\r\\ntheir wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these\\r\\nthings, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great\\r\\nbellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as\\r\\nirresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so\\r\\nenslaved them to the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them\\r\\nall; though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and\\r\\nmaple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran\\r\\ninto each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both\\r\\nbalanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the\\r\\nindividualities of the crew, this man\\'s valor, that man\\'s fear; guilt\\r\\nand guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all\\r\\ndirected to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did\\r\\npoint to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\r\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.  Clinging to a spar with\\r\\none hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;\\r\\nothers, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on\\r\\nthe rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready\\r\\nand ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that\\r\\ninfinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after\\r\\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been\\r\\nheard.  \"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts\\r\\none odd jet that way, and then disappears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken\\r\\nsome other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon\\r\\nproved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope\\r\\nbelayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an\\r\\norchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges\\r\\nof rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,\\r\\nas--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less\\r\\nthan a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any\\r\\ncalm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\\r\\nfountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;\\r\\nbut by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with\\r\\nhis utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\\r\\nbooms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\\r\\nmountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\\r\\nmiles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\\r\\noff, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of\\r\\ndefiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\\r\\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\\r\\nHeaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\\r\\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\\r\\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\\r\\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\\r\\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour\\r\\nand thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at\\r\\nthe fore.  The boats!--stand by!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\\r\\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\\r\\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\\r\\nfrom his perch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\\r\\none, rigged the afternoon previous.  \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is\\r\\nthine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\\r\\nfirst assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\\r\\nthe three crews.  Ahab\\'s boat was central; and cheering his men, he\\r\\ntold them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\\r\\nstraight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\\r\\ncertain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\\r\\nwhale\\'s sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\\r\\nwhile yet all three boats were plain as the ship\\'s three masts to his\\r\\neye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\\r\\nan instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\\r\\nlashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\\r\\nthe irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\\r\\nannihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\\r\\nskilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\\r\\nthe field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\\r\\na plank\\'s breadth; while all the time, Ahab\\'s unearthly slogan tore\\r\\nevery other cry but his to shreds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\\r\\nand recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\\r\\nthree lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\\r\\nthemselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\\r\\nhim; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\\r\\nrally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\\r\\nfirst paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking\\r\\nin upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some\\r\\nsnarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\\r\\nsharks!\\r\\n\\r\\nCaught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\\r\\nharpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\\r\\nflashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\\'s boat.\\r\\nOnly one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\\r\\nreached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\\r\\ndragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\\r\\nthen, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\\r\\nintercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\\r\\nThat instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\\r\\ntangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\\r\\nmore involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\\r\\nthem together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\\r\\nthen, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\\r\\nin which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\\r\\nround and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\\r\\npunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\\r\\nafter the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,\\r\\nwhile aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\\r\\ntwitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\\r\\nStubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while\\r\\nthe old man\\'s line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the\\r\\ncreamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\\r\\nof a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab\\'s yet unstricken boat seemed\\r\\ndrawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\\r\\nperpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\\r\\nforehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\\r\\nthe air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\\r\\nstruggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\\r\\nhe struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\\r\\nlittle distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\\r\\nwith his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\\r\\nflukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\\r\\nleast chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\\r\\ndrew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\\r\\nsatisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\\r\\nforehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\\r\\nlines, continued his leeward way at a traveller\\'s methodic pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\\r\\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\\r\\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\\r\\nand safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\\r\\nwrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\\r\\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\\r\\nthese were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\\r\\nbefallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\\r\\nfound grimly clinging to his boat\\'s broken half, which afforded a\\r\\ncomparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\\r\\nday\\'s mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\\r\\nas instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\\r\\nshoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist\\r\\nhim.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp\\r\\nsplinter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, Starbuck, \\'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who\\r\\nhe will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ferrule has not stood, sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up;\\r\\n\"I put good work into that leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d\\'ye see it.--But even\\r\\nwith a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living\\r\\nbone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that\\'s lost.  Nor\\r\\nwhite whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his\\r\\nown proper and inaccessible being.  Can any lead touch yonder floor,\\r\\nany mast scrape yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dead to leeward, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest\\r\\nof the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the\\r\\nboat\\'s crews.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! that the\\r\\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that\\r\\nshivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him\\r\\nyet.  By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man\\'s hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,\\r\\nthe Parsee was not there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Parsee!\" cried Stubb--\"he must have been caught in--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\\r\\nforecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\\r\\nnowhere to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Stubb--\"caught among the tangles of your line--I\\r\\nthought I saw him dragging under.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY line! MY line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--What\\r\\ndeath-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the\\r\\nbelfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d\\'ye see\\r\\nit?--the forged iron, men, the white whale\\'s--no, no, no,--blistered\\r\\nfool! this hand did dart it!--\\'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!  Keep\\r\\nhim nailed--Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--collect\\r\\nthe oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a\\r\\npull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life!\\r\\nI\\'ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight\\r\\nthrough it, but I\\'ll slay him yet!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,\" cried Starbuck;\\r\\n\"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus\\' name no more\\r\\nof this, that\\'s worse than devil\\'s madness.  Two days chased; twice\\r\\nstove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee;\\r\\nthy evil shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--\\r\\nwhat more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous\\r\\nfish till he swamps the last man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the\\r\\nbottom of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?\\r\\nOh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Starbuck, of late I\\'ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that\\r\\nhour we both saw--thou know\\'st what, in one another\\'s eyes.  But in\\r\\nthis matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm\\r\\nof this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for ever Ahab,\\r\\nman.  This whole act\\'s immutably decreed.  \\'Twas rehearsed by thee\\r\\nand me a billion years before this ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the\\r\\nFates\\' lieutenant; I act under orders.  Look thou, underling! that\\r\\nthou obeyest mine.--Stand round me, men.  Ye see an old man cut down\\r\\nto the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely\\r\\nfoot.  \\'Tis Ahab--his body\\'s part; but Ahab\\'s soul\\'s a centipede,\\r\\nthat moves upon a hundred legs.  I feel strained, half stranded, as\\r\\nropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.  But\\r\\nere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that\\r\\nAhab\\'s hawser tows his purpose yet.  Believe ye, men, in the things\\r\\ncalled omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere they drown,\\r\\ndrowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to\\r\\nsink for evermore.  So with Moby Dick--two days he\\'s floated--tomorrow\\r\\nwill be the third.  Aye, men, he\\'ll rise once more,--but only to\\r\\nspout his last!  D\\'ye feel brave men, brave?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As fearless fire,\" cried Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as mechanical,\" muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward, he\\r\\nmuttered on: \"The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked the\\r\\nsame to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly\\r\\nI seek to drive out of others\\' hearts what\\'s clinched so fast in\\r\\nmine!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go\\r\\nbefore:--but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How\\'s\\r\\nthat?--There\\'s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by\\r\\nthe ghosts of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk\\'s beak it pecks\\r\\nmy brain.  I\\'LL, I\\'LL solve it, though!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as\\r\\non the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\\r\\ngrindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by\\r\\nlanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and\\r\\nsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.  Meantime, of the\\r\\nbroken keel of Ahab\\'s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another\\r\\nleg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed\\r\\nwithin his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone\\r\\nbackward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 135\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chase.--Third Day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\\r\\nsolitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of\\r\\nthe daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"D\\'ye see him?\" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\\'s all.\\r\\nHelm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What a\\r\\nlovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a\\r\\nsummer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its\\r\\nthrowing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.\\r\\nHere\\'s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never\\r\\nthinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT\\'S tingling enough for\\r\\nmortal man! to think\\'s audacity.  God only has that right and\\r\\nprivilege.  Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;\\r\\nand our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for\\r\\nthat.  And yet, I\\'ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen\\r\\ncalm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents\\r\\nturned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair is growing now;\\r\\nthis moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it\\'s like that\\r\\nsort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy\\r\\nclefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the wild winds blow\\r\\nit; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the\\r\\ntossed ship they cling to.  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere\\r\\nthis through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\\r\\nventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\\r\\nOut upon it!--it\\'s tainted.  Were I the wind, I\\'d blow no more on\\r\\nsuch a wicked, miserable world.  I\\'d crawl somewhere to a cave, and\\r\\nslink there.  And yet, \\'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who\\r\\never conquered it?  In every fight it has the last and bitterest\\r\\nblow.  Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward\\r\\nwind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a\\r\\nsingle blow.  Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than THAT.\\r\\nWould now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most\\r\\nexasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but\\r\\nonly bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There\\'s a most special, a\\r\\nmost cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!  And yet, I say again,\\r\\nand swear it now, that there\\'s something all glorious and gracious in\\r\\nthe wind.  These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear\\r\\nheavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness;\\r\\nand veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea\\r\\nmay turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and\\r\\nswerve about, uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal\\r\\nPoles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these\\r\\nTrades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full\\r\\nas strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!  What\\r\\nd\\'ye see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging!  See the\\r\\nsun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I\\'ve oversailed him.  How, got the\\r\\nstart?  Aye, he\\'s chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that\\'s bad; I might\\r\\nhave known it, too.  Fool! the lines--the harpoons he\\'s towing.  Aye,\\r\\naye, I have run him by last night.  About! about!  Come down, all of\\r\\nye, but the regular look outs!  Man the braces!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nquarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the\\r\\nbraced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in\\r\\nher own white wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\" murmured Starbuck\\r\\nto himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.\\r\\n\"God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the\\r\\ninside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand by to sway me up!\" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.\\r\\n\"We should meet him soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" and straightway Starbuck did Ahab\\'s bidding, and\\r\\nonce more Ahab swung on high.\\r\\n\\r\\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.  Time itself now\\r\\nheld long breaths with keen suspense.  But at last, some three points\\r\\noff the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly\\r\\nfrom the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of\\r\\nfire had voiced it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!  On\\r\\ndeck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind\\'s eye.  He\\'s\\r\\ntoo far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!  Stand over\\r\\nthat helmsman with a top-maul!  So, so; he travels fast, and I must\\r\\ndown.  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the\\r\\nsea; there\\'s time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet somehow so\\r\\nyoung; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from\\r\\nthe sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same!--the same!--the same to Noah\\r\\nas to me.  There\\'s a soft shower to leeward.  Such lovely\\r\\nleewardings!  They must lead somewhere--to something else than common\\r\\nland, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward! the white whale goes that\\r\\nway; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter.  But\\r\\ngood bye, good bye, old mast-head!  What\\'s this?--green? aye, tiny\\r\\nmosses in these warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on\\r\\nAhab\\'s head!  There\\'s the difference now between man\\'s old age and\\r\\nmatter\\'s.  But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our\\r\\nhulls, though, are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that\\'s all.\\r\\nBy heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.\\r\\nI can\\'t compare with it; and I\\'ve known some ships made of dead trees\\r\\noutlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital\\r\\nfathers.  What\\'s that he said? he should still go before me, my\\r\\npilot; and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at the\\r\\nbottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all\\r\\nnight I\\'ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.  Aye, aye,\\r\\nlike many more thou told\\'st direful truth as touching thyself, O\\r\\nParsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.  Good-bye,\\r\\nmast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I\\'m gone.  We\\'ll\\r\\ntalk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,\\r\\ntied by head and tail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered\\r\\nthrough the cloven blue air to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop\\'s\\r\\nstern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to\\r\\nthe mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him\\r\\npause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Starbuck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the third time my soul\\'s ship starts upon this voyage,\\r\\nStarbuck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\\r\\nStarbuck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Truth, sir: saddest truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\\r\\nflood;--and I feel now like a billow that\\'s all one crested comb,\\r\\nStarbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck\\'s tears the glue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it\\'s\\r\\na brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lower away!\"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate\\'s arm from him.  \"Stand\\r\\nby the crew!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sharks! the sharks!\" cried a voice from the low cabin-window\\r\\nthere; \"O master, my master, come back!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and\\r\\nthe boat leaped on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,\\r\\nwhen numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters\\r\\nbeneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,\\r\\nevery time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the\\r\\nboat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the\\r\\nwhale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently\\r\\nfollowing them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the\\r\\nbanners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first\\r\\nsharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had\\r\\nbeen first descried; and whether it was that Ahab\\'s crew were all\\r\\nsuch tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to\\r\\nthe senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect\\r\\nthem,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\\r\\nmolesting the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heart of wrought steel!\" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\\r\\nfollowing with his eyes the receding boat--\"canst thou yet ring\\r\\nboldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\\r\\nfollowed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical\\r\\nthird day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous\\r\\nintense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the\\r\\nnoon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing--be that\\r\\nend what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,\\r\\nand leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a\\r\\nshudder!  Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and\\r\\nskeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl! thou\\r\\nfadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes\\r\\ngrown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but\\r\\nclouds sweep between--Is my journey\\'s end coming?  My legs feel\\r\\nfaint; like his who has footed it all day.  Feel thy heart,--beats\\r\\nit yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak\\r\\naloud!--Mast-head there!  See ye my boy\\'s hand on the\\r\\nhill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--\\r\\nmark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he\\r\\npecks--he tears the vane\"--pointing to the red flag flying at the\\r\\nmain-truck--\"Ha! he soars away with it!--Where\\'s the old man now?\\r\\nsee\\'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the\\r\\nmast-heads--a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had\\r\\nsounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on\\r\\nhis way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew\\r\\nmaintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered\\r\\nand hammered against the opposing bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\\r\\ndrive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and\\r\\nno hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me!  Ha! ha!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\\r\\nquickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of\\r\\nice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound was heard;\\r\\na subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled\\r\\nwith trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot\\r\\nlengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\\r\\nveil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\\r\\nfell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\\r\\nwaters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly\\r\\nsank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like\\r\\nnew milk round the marble trunk of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give way!\" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward\\r\\nto the attack; but maddened by yesterday\\'s fresh irons that corroded\\r\\nin him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that\\r\\nfell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his\\r\\nbroad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted\\r\\ntogether; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and\\r\\nonce more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from\\r\\nthe two mates\\' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of\\r\\ntheir bows, but leaving Ahab\\'s almost without a scar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as\\r\\nthe whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank\\r\\nas he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed\\r\\nround and round to the fish\\'s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns\\r\\nin which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions\\r\\nof the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;\\r\\nhis sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full\\r\\nupon old Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Befooled, befooled!\"--drawing in a long lean breath--\"Aye, Parsee!\\r\\nI see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is\\r\\nthe hearse that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last\\r\\nletter of thy word.  Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the\\r\\nship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and\\r\\nreturn to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first\\r\\nthing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I\\r\\nharpoon.  Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey\\r\\nme.--Where\\'s the whale? gone down again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with\\r\\nthe corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last\\r\\nencounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was\\r\\nnow again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the\\r\\nship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to\\r\\nhim, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed\\r\\nswimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing\\r\\nhis own straight path in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not too late is it, even now, the third\\r\\nday, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,\\r\\nthat madly seekest him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\\r\\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas.  And at last when Ahab was\\r\\nsliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\\'s\\r\\nface as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel\\r\\nabout, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.\\r\\nGlancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly\\r\\nmounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in\\r\\nthe two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and\\r\\nwere busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through\\r\\nthe port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb\\r\\nand Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\\r\\nlances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\\r\\nboats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But\\r\\nhe rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\\r\\nmain-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\\r\\nperch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and\\r\\nso nail it to the mast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether fagged by the three days\\' running chase, and the resistance\\r\\nto his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\\r\\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\\r\\nWhale\\'s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so\\r\\nrapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale\\'s last start\\r\\nhad not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over\\r\\nthe waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously\\r\\nstuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that\\r\\nthe blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in\\r\\nthe sea, at almost every dip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull\\r\\non! \\'tis the better rest, the shark\\'s jaw than the yielding water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell\"--he\\r\\nmuttered--\"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\\r\\nAhab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.  The helm!\\r\\ntake the helm! let me pass,\"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped\\r\\nhim forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along\\r\\nwith the White Whale\\'s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\\r\\nadvance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the\\r\\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale\\'s spout, curled\\r\\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\\r\\nwith body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\\r\\npoise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\\r\\nhated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if\\r\\nsucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically\\r\\nrolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in\\r\\nit, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the\\r\\nelevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once\\r\\nmore have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the\\r\\noarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were\\r\\ntherefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so\\r\\nfell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and\\r\\nrising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily\\r\\ninboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still\\r\\nafloat and swimming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\\r\\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\\r\\nsea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\\r\\nthe line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on\\r\\ntheir seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the\\r\\ntreacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the\\r\\nempty air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--\\'tis whole again; oars!\\r\\noars!  Burst in upon him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale\\r\\nwheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that\\r\\nevolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;\\r\\nseemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\\r\\nit--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\\r\\nupon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  \"I grow blind; hands!\\r\\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.  Is\\'t night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whale!  The ship!\" cried the cringing oarsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be\\r\\nfor ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his\\r\\nmark!  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not\\r\\nsave my ship?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\\r\\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two\\r\\nplanks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily\\r\\ndisabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,\\r\\nsplashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego\\'s mast-head hammer\\r\\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him\\r\\nas with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his\\r\\nown forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon\\r\\nthe bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as\\r\\nsoon as he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers of\\r\\nair, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\\r\\nwoman\\'s fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!\\r\\nIs this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long\\r\\nfidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.\\r\\nNay, nay!  Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his\\r\\nunappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he\\r\\ncannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now\\r\\nhelp Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee, thou\\r\\ngrinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but\\r\\nStubb\\'s own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a\\r\\nmattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!\\r\\nI grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!\\r\\nI call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.\\r\\nFor all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand\\r\\nthe cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there\\'ll be plenty\\r\\nof gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and\\r\\njacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy and over\\r\\nsalted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for\\r\\none red cherry ere we die!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.  Oh, Stubb, I\\r\\nhope my poor mother\\'s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers\\r\\nwill now come to her, for the voyage is up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the ship\\'s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;\\r\\nhammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained\\r\\nin their hands, just as they had darted from their various\\r\\nemployments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which\\r\\nfrom side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a\\r\\nbroad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he\\r\\nrushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his\\r\\nwhole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid\\r\\nwhite buttress of his forehead smote the ship\\'s starboard bow, till\\r\\nmen and timbers reeled.  Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like\\r\\ndislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their\\r\\nbull-like necks.  Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as\\r\\nmountain torrents down a flume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ship!  The hearse!--the second hearse!\" cried Ahab from the\\r\\nboat; \"its wood could only be American!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its\\r\\nkeel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far\\r\\noff the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab\\'s boat, where, for\\r\\na time, he lay quiescent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I turn my body from the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy\\r\\nhammer.  Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked\\r\\nkeel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,\\r\\nand Pole-pointed prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish,\\r\\nand without me?  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest\\r\\nshipwrecked captains?  Oh, lonely death on lonely life!  Oh, now I\\r\\nfeel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.  Ho, ho! from all\\r\\nyour furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole\\r\\nforegone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!  Towards\\r\\nthee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last\\r\\nI grapple with thee; from hell\\'s heart I stab at thee; for hate\\'s\\r\\nsake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins and all hearses\\r\\nto one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to\\r\\npieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned\\r\\nwhale!  THUS, I give up the spear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with\\r\\nigniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul.  Ahab\\r\\nstooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him\\r\\nround the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their\\r\\nvictim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.\\r\\nNext instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope\\'s final end flew out\\r\\nof the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,\\r\\ndisappeared in its depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant, the tranced boat\\'s crew stood still; then turned.\\r\\n\"The ship?  Great God, where is the ship?\"  Soon they through dim,\\r\\nbewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the\\r\\ngaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while\\r\\nfixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty\\r\\nperches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking\\r\\nlookouts on the sea.  And now, concentric circles seized the lone\\r\\nboat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every\\r\\nlance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round\\r\\nin one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\\r\\nsunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of\\r\\nthe erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the\\r\\nflag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the\\r\\ndestroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm\\r\\nand a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act\\r\\nof nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.  A\\r\\nsky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from\\r\\nits natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and\\r\\nincommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its\\r\\nbroad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and\\r\\nsimultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage\\r\\nbeneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the\\r\\nbird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak\\r\\nthrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of\\r\\nAhab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to\\r\\nhell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and\\r\\nhelmeted herself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen\\r\\nwhite surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the\\r\\ngreat shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years\\r\\nago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEpilogue\\r\\n\\r\\n\"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE\"\\r\\nJob.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drama\\'s done.  Why then here does any one step forth?--Because\\r\\none did survive the wreck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced, that after the Parsee\\'s disappearance, I was he whom\\r\\nthe Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab\\'s bowsman, when that\\r\\nbowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day\\r\\nthe three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped\\r\\nastern.  So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full\\r\\nsight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me,\\r\\nI was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.  When I\\r\\nreached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.  Round and round, then,\\r\\nand ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis\\r\\nof that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.\\r\\nTill, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and\\r\\nnow, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its\\r\\ngreat buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot\\r\\nlengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.  Buoyed\\r\\nup by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a\\r\\nsoft and dirgelike main.  The unharming sharks, they glided by as if\\r\\nwith padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with\\r\\nsheathed beaks.  On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and\\r\\npicked me up at last.  It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in\\r\\nher retracing search after her missing children, only found another\\r\\norphan.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
              " '[Emma by Jane Austen 1816]\\n\\nVOLUME I\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\\nand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\\nof existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her.\\n\\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister\\'s marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection.\\n\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family,\\nless as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\\nbut particularly of Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming Miss Taylor\\'s judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\\n\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma\\'s situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.\\n\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss\\nTaylor\\'s loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.\\n\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning\\'s work for her.\\nThe want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.\\nShe recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella\\'s marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\\nShe had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.\\n\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.\\n\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.\\n\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\\nbe struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\\nvisit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.\\n\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\nTaylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.\\nHis spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter\\'s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\\nEmma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it\\nis that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.  Mr. Weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us\\nfor ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"\\n\\n\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\\nmy dear.\"\\n\\n\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\\nus!--We shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.\\nI could not walk half so far.\"\\n\\n\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"\\n\\n\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit?\"\\n\\n\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston\\'s stable, papa.  You know we\\nhave settled all that already.  We talked it all over with Mr. Weston\\nlast night.  And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to Randalls, because of his daughter\\'s being housemaid there.\\nI only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was\\nyour doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought\\nof Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.\\nI am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"\\n\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.\\nThe backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella\\'s husband.\\nHe lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days\\' absence, and now walked\\nup to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\\nIt was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.\\nMr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse\\ngratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, sir.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat I must draw back from your great fire.\"\\n\\n\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"\\n\\n\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\\n\\n\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.\\nHow did you all behave? Who cried most?\"\\n\\n\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! \\'Tis a sad business.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.\\' I have a great regard for you and Emma;\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\\nany rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"\\n\\n\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"\\nsaid Emma playfully.  \"That is what you have in your head,\\nI know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\\n\\n\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a sigh.  \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\\nMr. Knightley to mean _you_.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant\\nonly myself.  Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--\\nin a joke--it is all a joke.  We always say what we like to one another.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body.\\n\\n\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I\\nmeant no reflection on any body.  Miss Taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please; she will now have but one.\\nThe chances are that she must be a gainer.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear\\nabout the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all\\nbehaved charmingly.  Every body was punctual, every body in their\\nbest looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,\\nand were sure of meeting every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.\\n\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,\\nand I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\\n\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.\\n\"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley.  \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\\nif we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nMiss Taylor\\'s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\\nat Miss Taylor\\'s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.\\nEvery friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried.\"\\n\\n\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\\n\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.\\nI made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\\nand be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her.  Her father fondly replied,\\n\"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass.  Pray do not make any\\nmore matches.\"\\n\\n\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\\nfor other people.  It is the greatest amusement in the world! And\\nafter such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again.  Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\\nso long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\\nMr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it.  Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.\\nSome people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\\nof it.\\n\\n\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject.\\nI planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\\noff match-making.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,\\'\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\"Success supposes endeavour.  Your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage.  A worthy employment for a young\\nlady\\'s mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\\nas you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\\none idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\\nif Mr. Weston were to marry her,\\' and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where\\nis your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;\\nand _that_ is all that can be said.\"\\n\\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--\\nI pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky\\nguess is never merely luck.  There is always some talent in it.\\nAnd as to my poor word `success,\\' which you quarrel with, I do not\\nknow that I am so entirely without any claim to it.  You have drawn\\ntwo pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something\\nbetween the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston\\'s\\nvisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed\\nmany little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.\\nI think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\"\\n\\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns.  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,\\nthan good to them, by interference.\"\\n\\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.  \"But, my dear,\\npray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up\\none\\'s family circle grievously.\"\\n\\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.  Poor Mr. Elton! You\\nlike Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.\\nThere is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been\\nhere a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,\\nthat it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think\\nvery well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing\\nhim a service.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very\\ngood young man, and I have a great regard for him.  But if you\\nwant to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come\\nand dine with us some day.  That will be a much better thing.\\nI dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.\"\\n\\n\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much\\nbetter thing.  Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.\\nDepend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care\\nof himself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\\n\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\\nof a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\\nwith him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\\nwho had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\\nwhich the connexion would offend.\\n\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\\nof her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\\ntook place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\\nwho threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,\\nand did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found\\nmore in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\\nshe had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brother\\'s unreasonable anger,\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond\\ntheir income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\\nshe did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\n\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years\\' marriage,\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.\\nThe boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mother\\'s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\\nSome scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\\nto have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could.\\n\\nA complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.\\nIt was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still\\na small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.\\nHe had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\\nalways longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition.\\n\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\\nlooked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\\nin view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,\\nbought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;\\nhis own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\\namiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.\\n\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\\nhis own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncle\\'s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\\nIt was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\\nfather\\'s assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it.\\nThe aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\\nbut it was not in Mr. Weston\\'s nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\\nso deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,\\nand was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.\\nHe was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern.\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\n\\nNow, upon his father\\'s marriage, it was very generally proposed,\\nas a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.\\nThere was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when\\nMrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank\\nChurchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.\\nFor a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  \"I suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written\\nto Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.\\nMr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.\\n\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\nwithout pain, of Emma\\'s losing a single pleasure, or suffering\\nan hour\\'s ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\\nEmma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston\\'s\\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together.\\n\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her\\nsatisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,\\nwas so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\n`poor Miss Taylor,\\' when they left her at Randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.\\nBut never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\\'s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\"\\n\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto Mr. Woodhouse.  The compliments of his neighbours were over;\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;\\nand the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,\\nwas all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself.\\nWhat was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;\\nand he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any body\\'s eating it.  He had been at the pains\\nof consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.  Mr. Perry\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree\\nwith many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.\\nWith such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the\\ncake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone.\\n\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston\\'s wedding-cake in their\\nhands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\\nfrom his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,\\nfrom his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.\\nHe had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;\\nhis horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.\\nFortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\\nand Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\\ncomprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma\\'s persuasion,\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening\\nparties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.\\n\\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\\nand by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s drawing-room,\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being\\nthrown away.\\n\\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able\\nof whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it\\ntaken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.\\n\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a\\nvery old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.\\nShe lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,\\nunder such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,\\nhandsome, rich, nor married.  Miss Bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour;\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.\\nShe had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.  Her youth\\nhad passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman,\\nand a woman whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own\\nuniversal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.\\nShe loved every body, was interested in every body\\'s happiness,\\nquicksighted to every body\\'s merits; thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,\\nand so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,\\nher contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\\nand a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,\\nor an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but\\na real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education, without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard\\'s school was in high repute--and\\nvery deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.\\nIt was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly\\nowed much to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s kindness, felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,\\nwhenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\\n\\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect; and happy was she, for her father\\'s sake,\\nin the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,\\nit was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.  She was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\\n\\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,\\nin most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;\\na most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,\\nwhom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,\\non account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned,\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\\n\\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had\\nplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard\\'s school,\\nand somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\\nto that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known\\nof her history.  She had no visible friends but what had been\\nacquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit\\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.\\n\\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,\\nwith a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,\\nand a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,\\nEmma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance.\\n\\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith\\'s\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\\nand deserve encouragement.  Encouragement should be given.\\nThose soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be\\nwasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.\\nThe acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.\\nThe friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort\\nof people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name\\nof Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm\\nof Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,\\nshe believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they\\nmust be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates\\nof a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect.  _She_ would notice her; she would improve her;\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.\\nIt would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\\n\\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\\nand listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\\nwhich always closed such parties, and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\\nand moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,\\nwith the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.\\n\\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.\\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.\\n\\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\\nhe could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he\\nmight constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing\\nthe nicer things, to say:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.\\nAn egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling\\nan egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled\\nby any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,\\nyou see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,\\nlet Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.\\nOurs are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome\\npreserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say\\nyou to _half_ a glass of wine? A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler\\nof water? I do not think it could disagree with you.\"\\n\\nEmma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in\\na much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had\\nparticular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness\\nof Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.  Miss Woodhouse\\nwas so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the\\nintroduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,\\ngrateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,\\ndelighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated\\nher all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHarriet Smith\\'s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.\\nQuick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,\\nso did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,\\nEmma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston\\'s loss had been important.  Her father\\nnever went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground\\nsufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;\\nand since Mrs. Weston\\'s marriage her exercise had been too much confined.\\nShe had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;\\nand a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any\\ntime to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.\\nBut in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,\\nand was confirmed in all her kind designs.\\n\\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,\\ngrateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment\\nto herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,\\nand power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that\\nthere was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must\\nnot be expected.  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet\\nSmith\\'s being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the\\nsomething which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston\\nwas out of the question.  Two such could never be granted.\\nTwo such she did not want.  It was quite a different sort of thing,\\na sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object\\nof a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.\\nFor Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\\n\\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.\\nEmma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never\\nbelieve that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered\\nthe truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied\\nto hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;\\nand looked no farther.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and\\nbut for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,\\nit must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts\\na good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place.  Emma encouraged her\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin\\'s having \"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,\\nindeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard\\'s drawing-room;\\nand of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years\\nwith her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,\\nand one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;\\nand of Mrs. Martin\\'s saying as she was so fond of it, it should be\\ncalled _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house\\nin their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink\\ntea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.\"\\n\\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;\\nbut as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.\\nShe had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,\\na son and son\\'s wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared\\nthat the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always\\nmentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something\\nor other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,\\nno wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she\\nwere not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\\n\\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number\\nand meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it.  Harriet was very ready\\nto speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured\\nand obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\\nher some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,\\nand in every thing else he was so very obliging.  He had his\\nshepherd\\'s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\\nShe was very fond of singing.  He could sing a little himself.\\nShe believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.\\nHe had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,\\nhe had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.\\nShe believed every body spoke well of him.  His mother and sisters\\nwere very fond of him.  Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there\\nwas a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,\\nhe would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.\\nShe was in no hurry at all.\\n\\n\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma.  \"You know what you are about.\"\\n\\n\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had\\never seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all\\nthe three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,\\nto sup with her.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line\\nof his own business? He does not read?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has\\nread a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.\\nHe reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay\\nin one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.\\nBut sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read\\nsomething aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.\\nAnd I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.  He never read the\\nRomance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.  He had never\\nheard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined\\nto get them now as soon as ever he can.\"\\n\\nThe next question was--\\n\\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain\\nat first, but I do not think him so plain now.  One does not, you know,\\nafter a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every\\nnow and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\\nto Kingston.  He has passed you very often.\"\\n\\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without\\nhaving any idea of his name.  A young farmer, whether on horseback\\nor on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.\\nThe yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I\\ncan have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable\\nappearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their\\nfamilies in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,\\nand is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every\\nother he is below it.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have\\nobserved him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.\\nI know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.\\nWhat do you imagine his age to be?\"\\n\\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is\\nthe 23rd just a fortnight and a day\\'s difference--which is very odd.\"\\n\\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.  His mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry.  They seem very comfortable\\nas they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,\\nshe would probably repent it.  Six years hence, if he could meet\\nwith a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,\\nwith a little money, it might be very desirable.\"\\n\\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\\n\\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,\\nwho are not born to an independence.  Mr. Martin, I imagine,\\nhas his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with\\nthe world.  Whatever money he might come into when his father died,\\nwhatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,\\nall afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,\\nwith diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to\\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, so it is.  But they live very comfortably.\\nThey have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;\\nand Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though\\nhis sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether\\nobjected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\\nfor you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you\\nparticularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt\\nof your being a gentleman\\'s daughter, and you must support your\\nclaim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there\\nwill be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.  But while I visit\\nat Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,\\nI am not afraid of what any body can do.\"\\n\\n\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable\\nto have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say\\nthat if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,\\nI wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,\\nto be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere\\nfarmer\\'s daughter, without education.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure.  Yes.  Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up.\\nHowever, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your\\'s--and I\\nam sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.  I shall\\nalways have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,\\nand should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well\\neducated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,\\ncertainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,\\nand saw no alarming symptoms of love.  The young man had been\\nthe first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,\\nand that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet\\'s side,\\nto oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.\\n\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road.  He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully\\nat her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.\\nEmma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;\\nand walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made\\nher quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.\\nHis appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,\\nbut his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be\\ncontrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground\\nhe had gained in Harriet\\'s inclination.  Harriet was not insensible\\nof manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father\\'s gentleness\\nwith admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he\\ndid not know what manner was.\\n\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must\\nnot be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a\\nsmiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse\\nhoped very soon to compose.\\n\\n\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was\\nquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.\\nHe did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked\\ntowards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the\\nRomance of the Forest yet.  He was so busy the last time he was\\nat Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.\\nSo very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he\\nlike what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him\\nso very plain?\"\\n\\n\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no\\nright to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no\\nidea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.\\nI had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not\\nso genteel as real gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,\\nthat you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.\\nAt Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,\\nwell bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,\\nyou could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving\\nhim to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at\\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.\\nDo not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure\\nyou must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,\\nand the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated\\nas I stood here.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine\\nair and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference\\nplain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley\\'s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\\nto compare Mr. Martin with _him_.  You might not see one in a hundred\\nwith _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is\\nnot the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you\\nto Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.\\nCompare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;\\nof being silent.  You must see the difference.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost\\nan old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"\\n\\n\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.  The older a\\nperson grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners\\nshould not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,\\nor coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.  What is passable in youth\\nis detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;\\nwhat will he be at Mr. Weston\\'s time of life?\"\\n\\n\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\n\\n\"But there may be pretty good guessing.  He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking\\nof nothing but profit and loss.\"\\n\\n\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"\\n\\n\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.  What has\\nhe to do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,\\nand be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse\\nneed not disturb _us_.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet\\'s answer,\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might\\nbe safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time.\\nHer next beginning was,\\n\\n\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\'s manners are superior\\nto Mr. Knightley\\'s or Mr. Weston\\'s. They have more gentleness.\\nThey might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,\\na quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body\\nlikes in _him_, because there is so much good-humour with it--but\\nthat would not do to be copied.  Neither would Mr. Knightley\\'s\\ndownright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits\\n_him_ very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem\\nto allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,\\nhe would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man\\nmight be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.\\nMr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not\\nknow whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\\nof us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his\\nmanners are softer than they used to be.  If he means any thing,\\nit must be to please you.  Did not I tell you what he said of you\\nthe other day?\"\\n\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\\nfrom Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed\\nand smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\n\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving\\nthe young farmer out of Harriet\\'s head.  She thought it would\\nbe an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,\\nand probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.\\nShe feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.\\nIt was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled\\nher in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during\\nthe very first evening of Harriet\\'s coming to Hartfield.  The longer\\nshe considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.\\nMr. Elton\\'s situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,\\nand without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family\\nthat could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.  He had a\\ncomfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;\\nfor though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly\\nof him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\n\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,\\nwas foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet\\'s there could be\\nlittle doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\\nthe usual weight and efficacy.  And he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.\\nHe was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,\\nthough not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which\\nshe could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified\\nby a Robert Martin\\'s riding about the country to get walnuts\\nfor her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton\\'s admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"of\\nthis great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.\"\\n\\n\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"\\n\\n\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"\\n\\n\"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her\\nwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.\\nI have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.\\nHow very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any\\ngood! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\\nabout Emma, Mr. Knightley.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,\\nknowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,\\nfor he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking\\nof it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,\\nthat there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.\\nMr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.\\nYou are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value\\nof a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\\na woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used\\nto it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.\\nShe is not the superior young woman which Emma\\'s friend ought to be.\\nBut on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,\\nit will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will\\nread together.  She means it, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\\nyears old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at\\nvarious times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and\\nvery good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly\\narranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.\\nThe list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it\\ndid her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;\\nand I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I\\nhave done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.\\nShe will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,\\nand a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor\\nfailed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do\\nnothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you\\nwished.--You know you could not.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought\\nso _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma\\'s\\nomitting to do any thing I wished.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"--said\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  \"But I,\"\\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,\\nmust still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the\\ncleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of\\nbeing able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.\\nShe was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.\\nAnd ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house\\nand of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope\\nwith her.  She inherits her mother\\'s talents, and must have been\\nunder subjection to her.\"\\n\\n\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on\\n_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family and wanted\\nanother situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for\\nme to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling.  \"You are better placed _here_; very fit\\nfor a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.\\nYou might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would\\nseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_,\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,\\nand doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend\\nhim a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife\\nto such a man as Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,\\nand that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing\\nto be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross\\nfrom the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\"\\n\\n\"Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma\\'s\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,\\nthe young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think\\nher the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.\\nShe knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.\\nShe is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,\\nbecause undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can\\nEmma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet\\nis presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,\\nI will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance.\\nHartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places\\nshe belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable\\nwith those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.\\nI am much mistaken if Emma\\'s doctrines give any strength of mind,\\nor tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties\\nof her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.\"\\n\\n\"I either depend more upon Emma\\'s good sense than you do, or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\nHow well she looked last night!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?\\nVery well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma\\'s being pretty.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer\\nperfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have\\nseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.\\nBut I am a partial old friend.\"\\n\\n\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,\\nher glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture\\nof health;\\' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\\npicture of grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley,\\nis not she?\"\\n\\n\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied.\\n\"I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I\\nwill add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.\\nConsidering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little\\noccupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am\\nnot to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread\\nof its doing them both harm.\"\\n\\n\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its\\nnot doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma\\'s little faults,\\nshe is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,\\nor a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities\\nwhich may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;\\nshe will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the\\nright a hundred times.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,\\nand I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John\\nand Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore\\nnot a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;\\nexcept when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.\\nI am sure of having their opinions with me.\"\\n\\n\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma\\'s\\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think\\nany possible good can arise from Harriet Smith\\'s intimacy being made\\na matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing\\nany little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,\\nit cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,\\nwho perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,\\nso long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so\\nmany years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,\\nMr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" cried he; \"I am much obliged to you for it.\\nIt is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your\\nadvice has often found; for it shall be attended to.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy\\nabout her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Be satisfied,\" said he, \"I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep\\nmy ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma.\\nIsabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a\\ngreater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,\\na curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become\\nof her!\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Weston gently, \"very much.\"\\n\\n\"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,\\nmeans just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet\\never seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her\\nto be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see\\nEmma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.\\nBut there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom\\nfrom home.\"\\n\\n\"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break\\nher resolution at present,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"as can well be;\\nand while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be\\nforming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties\\non poor Mr. Woodhouse\\'s account.  I do not recommend matrimony\\nat present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.\"\\n\\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of\\nher own and Mr. Weston\\'s on the subject, as much as possible.\\nThere were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma\\'s destiny, but it\\nwas not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition\\nwhich Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to \"What does Weston\\nthink of the weather; shall we have rain?\" convinced her that he\\nhad nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet\\'s fancy\\na proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity\\nto a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible\\nthan before of Mr. Elton\\'s being a remarkably handsome man, with most\\nagreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up\\nthe assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon\\npretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet\\'s side,\\nas there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced\\nof Mr. Elton\\'s being in the fairest way of falling in love,\\nif not in love already.  She had no scruple with regard to him.\\nHe talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.\\nHis perception of the striking improvement of Harriet\\'s manner,\\nsince her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least\\nagreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\\n\\n\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he;\\n\"you have made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature\\nwhen she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have\\nadded are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet\\nonly wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.\\nShe had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness\\nin herself.  I have done very little.\"\\n\\n\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant\\nMr. Elton--\\n\\n\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,\\nhave taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her\\nway before.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.  So much superadded\\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\"\\n\\n\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.  I never met with\\na disposition more truly amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort\\nof sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.\\nShe was not less pleased another day with the manner\\nin which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet\\'s picture.\\n\\n\"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\" said she: \"did\\nyou ever sit for your picture?\"\\n\\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\\nwith a very interesting naivete,\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"\\n\\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\\n\\n\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\\ngive any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had\\na great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of\\nmy friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.\\nBut from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.\\nBut really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.\\nIt would be such a delight to have her picture!\"\\n\\n\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!\\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a\\ntalent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are.\\nHow could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in\\nspecimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston\\nsome inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"\\n\\nYes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don\\'t pretend to be\\nin raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet\\'s face.\\n\"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe\\nI shall try what I can do.  Harriet\\'s features are very delicate,\\nwhich makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity\\nin the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought\\nto catch.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I\\nhave not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it.\\nAs you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,\\nbe an exquisite possession.\"\\n\\n\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.\\nShe thinks so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her\\nmanner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my\\npicture be drawn?\\'\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me.\\nBut still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\\n\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\\npressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\\nat portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they\\nmight decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many\\nbeginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.\\nShe had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress\\nboth in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\\nlabour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew\\nin almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\\nwould have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.\\nShe was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\\nor a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\\nthan it deserved.\\n\\nThere was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;\\nher style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness\\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse\\'s performances must be capital.\\n\\n\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma.  \"I had only my\\nown family to study from.  There is my father--another of my\\nfather--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,\\nthat I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very\\nlike therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.\\nDear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.\\nShe would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really\\nquite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.\\nI should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have\\nsat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\\nchildren that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are,\\nHenry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,\\nand any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so\\neager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no\\nmaking children of three or four years old stand still you know;\\nnor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the\\nair and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any\\nof mama\\'s children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,\\nwho was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it\\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.\\nHe had nestled down his head most conveniently.  That\\'s very like.\\nI am rather proud of little George.  The corner of the sofa is very good.\\nThen here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my brother,\\nMr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I\\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.\\nI could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I\\nhad really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too\\nflattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\\nall this, came poor dear Isabella\\'s cold approbation of--\"Yes,\\nit was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\"\\nWe had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.\\nIt was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I\\ncould bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised\\nover as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in\\nBrunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing\\nany body again.  But for Harriet\\'s sake, or rather for my own,\\nand as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,\\nI will break my resolution now.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,\\nand was repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present\\nindeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,\"\\nwith so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider\\nwhether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she\\nwanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.\\n\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.\\nIt was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John\\nKnightley\\'s, and was destined, if she could please herself,\\nto hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.\\n\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid\\nof not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.\\nBut there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind\\nher and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing\\nhimself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;\\nbut was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to\\nplace himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him\\nin reading.\\n\\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith\\'s.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was only too happy.  Harriet listened, and Emma drew\\nin peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;\\nany thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;\\nand he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,\\nto jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no\\nbeing displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration\\nmade him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.\\nShe could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance\\nwere unexceptionable.\\n\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite\\nenough pleased with the first day\\'s sketch to wish to go on.\\nThere was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,\\nand as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,\\nto give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had\\ngreat confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,\\nand of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a\\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,\\nand the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations\\nas Mr. Elton\\'s very promising attachment was likely to add.\\n\\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\\n\\n\"By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one\\nof the party.\"\\n\\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress\\nof the picture, which was rapid and happy.  Every body who saw it\\nwas pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended\\nit through every criticism.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting\\nthat she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is\\nmost correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.\\nIt is the fault of her face that she has them not.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" replied he.  \"I cannot agree with you.\\nIt appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.\\nI never saw such a likeness in my life.  We must allow for the effect\\nof shade, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,\\n\\n\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.  Consider,\\nshe is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which\\nin short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must\\nbe preserved, you know.  Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it\\ngives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith\\'s. Exactly so indeed!\"\\n\\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"So prettily done! Just\\nas your drawings always are, my dear.  I do not know any body who draws\\nso well as you do.  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,\\nthat she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl\\nover her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\\nLook at the tree.\"\\n\\n\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess\\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss\\nSmith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable\\nspirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.\\nThe naivete of Miss Smith\\'s manners--and altogether--Oh, it is\\nmost admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such\\na likeness.\"\\n\\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\\nfew difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\ncould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\\nmust not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs\\nof December.  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,\\nthan it was removed.  His gallantry was always on the alert.\\n\"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure\\nshould he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.\\nIt was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being\\nemployed on such an errand.\"\\n\\n\"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would\\nnot give him such a troublesome office for the world,\"--brought\\non the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and\\na very few minutes settled the business.\\n\\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,\\nand give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it\\nas to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he\\nseemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.\\n\\n\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he\\nreceived it.\\n\\n\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma.\\n\"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different\\nways of being in love.  He is an excellent young man, and will suit\\nHarriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,\\' as he says himself;\\nbut he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more\\nthan I could endure as a principal.  I come in for a pretty good\\nshare as a second.  But it is his gratitude on Harriet\\'s account.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThe very day of Mr. Elton\\'s going to London produced a fresh occasion\\nfor Emma\\'s services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,\\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home\\nto return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.\\nHalf a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got\\nback to Mrs. Goddard\\'s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,\\nand finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left\\na little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;\\nand on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two\\nsongs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;\\nand this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct\\nproposal of marriage.  \"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized\\nshe did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;\\nand a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote\\nas if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,\\nshe was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she\\nshould do.--\" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so\\npleased and so doubtful.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose\\nany thing for want of asking.  He will connect himself well if he can.\"\\n\\n\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet.  \"Pray do.  I\\'d rather\\nyou would.\"\\n\\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.\\nThe style of the letter was much above her expectation.\\nThere were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it\\nwould not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,\\nwas strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much\\nto the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense,\\nwarm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.\\nShe paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for\\nher opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last forced to add,\\n\"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so\\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of\\nhis sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young\\nman whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself\\nso well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the\\nstyle of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;\\nnot diffuse enough for a woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man,\\nand I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and\\nclearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find\\nproper words.  It is so with some men.  Yes, I understand the sort\\nof mind.  Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,\\nnot coarse.  A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)\\nthan I had expected.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well--and--and what\\nshall I do?\"\\n\\n\"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard\\nto this letter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will\\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your\\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must\\nbe unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,\\nwill present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.\\nYou need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow\\nfor his disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\\n\\n\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you\\nin any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I\\nhave been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding\\nyou, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.\\nI had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\\n\\nHarriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\\n\\n\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would\\nyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I\\nought to do.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to\\ndo with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\\ncontemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered\\nin her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery\\nof that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\\n\\n\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_\\nas to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought\\nto refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,\\' she ought to say\\n`No\\' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into\\nwith doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty\\nas a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.\\nBut do not imagine that I want to influence you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you\\nwould just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean\\nthat--As you say, one\\'s mind ought to be quite made up--One should\\nnot be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer\\nto say `No,\\' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?\\'\"\\n\\n\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise\\nyou either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.\\nIf you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him\\nthe most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should\\nyou hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you\\nat this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not\\ndeceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.\\nAt this moment whom are you thinking of?\"\\n\\nThe symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned\\naway confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though\\nthe letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted\\nabout without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience,\\nbut not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,\\nHarriet said--\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must\\ndo as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,\\nand really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.  Do you\\nthink I am right?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\nwhat you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings\\nto myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no\\nhesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.\\nIt would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have\\nbeen the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in\\nthe smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would\\nnot influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.\\nI could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.\\nNow I am secure of you for ever.\"\\n\\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck\\nher forcibly.\\n\\n\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast.\\n\"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.\\nThat would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nI would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you\\nfor any thing in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;\\nbut it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all\\ngood society.  I must have given you up.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed\\nme never to come to Hartfield any more!\"\\n\\n\"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!\\nI wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.\\nHe must have a pretty good opinion of himself.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\" said Harriet,\\nher conscience opposing such censure; \"at least, he is very good natured,\\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\\nfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,\\nthough he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and\\ncertainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen\\npeople--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,\\nthere is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable.\\nHowever, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,\\nand have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached\\nto me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,\\nit is what I would not do upon any consideration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not\\nbe parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,\\nor because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"\\n\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a\\n\"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the\\nclownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,\\nto know that her husband could write a good letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him.\\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\\n\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,\\nand advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,\\nin the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest\\nagainst any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the\\nformation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,\\nin replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was\\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;\\nand she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,\\nand thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,\\nand was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,\\nthat Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,\\nhe would have been accepted after all.\\n\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.\\nThe business was finished, and Harriet safe.  She was rather low\\nall the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,\\nand sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,\\nsometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.\\n\\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather\\na sorrowful tone.\\n\\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.\\nYou are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared\\nto Abbey-Mill.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\\nbut at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very\\nmuch surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash\\nwould--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,\\nand it is only a linen-draper.\"\\n\\n\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\nteacher of a school, Harriet.  I dare say Miss Nash would envy you\\nsuch an opportunity as this of being married.  Even this conquest\\nwould appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you,\\nI suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain\\nperson can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.\\nHitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks\\nand manners have explained themselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering\\nthat people should like her so much.  The idea of Mr. Elton was\\ncertainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted\\nagain towards the rejected Mr. Martin.\\n\\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly.  \"I wonder what they\\nare all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,\\nthey will be unhappy too.  I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\\n\\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\ncheerfully employed,\" cried Emma.  \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\nis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much\\nmore beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five\\nor six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\\n\\n\"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\\n\\n\"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.  No, my dear\\nlittle modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be\\nin Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.\\nIt is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.\\nIt opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,\\nit diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,\\neager curiosity and warm prepossession.  How cheerful, how animated,\\nhow suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!\"\\n\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she\\nhad been spending more than half her time there, and gradually\\ngetting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma\\njudged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her\\nwith them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged\\nto go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\\nbut it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,\\nto make a regular visit of some days.\\n\\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with\\nMr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up\\nhis mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,\\nand was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples\\nof his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.\\nMr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering\\nby his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted\\napologies and civil hesitations of the other.\\n\\n\"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you\\nwill not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take\\nEmma\\'s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun\\nis out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.\\nI treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think we\\nare privileged people.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\"\\n\\n\"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  Emma will be happy\\nto entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse\\nand take my three turns--my winter walk.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot do better, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,\\nbut I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;\\nand, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I\\nthink the sooner _you_ go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat\\nand open the garden door for you.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined\\nfor more chat.  He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking\\nof her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\\n\\n\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a\\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of\\nher disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with;\\nbut in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will\\ntell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her\\nschool-girl\\'s giggle; she really does you credit.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I\\nhad been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow\\npraise where they may.  _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than\\nshe intended.\"\\n\\n\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\"\\n\\n\"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\"\\n\\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore\\nsaid nothing.  He presently added, with a smile,\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you\\nthat I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon\\nhear of something to her advantage.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! how so? of what sort?\"\\n\\n\"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling.\\n\\n\"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love\\nwith her? Who makes you their confidant?\"\\n\\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton\\'s having dropt a hint.\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\\nMr. Elton looked up to him.\\n\\n\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will\\nsoon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\\nquarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,\\nthis summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately\\nin love and means to marry her.\"\\n\\n\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet\\nmeans to marry him?\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came\\nto the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.\\nHe knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,\\nI believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask\\nme whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;\\nwhether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his\\nchoice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being\\nconsidered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line\\nof society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said.\\nI never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.\\nHe always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very\\nwell judging.  He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,\\nand what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is\\nan excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation\\nin advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;\\nand that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.\\nI praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.\\nIf he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought\\nhighly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the\\nbest friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night\\nbefore last.  Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should\\nbe at Mrs. Goddard\\'s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,\\nwithout thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\\ndid not speak yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it;\\nbut it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what\\nyou have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,\\nand was refused.\"\\n\\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;\\nand Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,\\nas he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\\n\\n\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.\\nWhat is the foolish girl about?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible\\nto a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.\\nA man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is\\nthe meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,\\nif it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\\n\\n\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"\\n\\n\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is\\nyour doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should\\nnot feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable\\nyoung man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet\\'s equal; and am\\nrather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.\\nBy your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is\\na pity that they were ever got over.\"\\n\\n\"Not Harriet\\'s equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;\\nand with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he\\nis not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense\\nas in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.\\nWhat are Harriet Smith\\'s claims, either of birth, nature or education,\\nto any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural\\ndaughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision\\nat all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only\\nas parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,\\nnor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful,\\nand is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.\\nAt her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,\\nis not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.\\nShe is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.\\nMy only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being\\nbeneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,\\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.\\nBut I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing\\nto trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort\\nof disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led\\naright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt\\nto be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)\\nthat there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.\\nEven _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately\\nthat you would not regret your friend\\'s leaving Highbury, for the\\nsake of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself,\\n`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a\\ngood match.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\\nany such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying\\na man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I\\nwonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.\\nI assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement\\nby no means fair.  You are not just to Harriet\\'s claims.\\nThey would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;\\nMr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly\\nher inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves\\nis much above his.--It would be a degradation.\"\\n\\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married\\nto a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\\n\\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense\\nshe may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.\\nShe is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below\\nthe level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely\\nbe a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of\\nfortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged\\nfor her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman\\'s daughter,\\nis indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen\\'s daughters,\\nno one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\\n\\n\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may\\nhave had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part\\nof their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,\\nin Mrs. Goddard\\'s line, to have Mrs. Goddard\\'s acquaintance.\\nHer friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_\\ngood enough.  She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose\\nto turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,\\nnor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the\\nMartins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.\\nIf she has it now, you have given it.  You have been no friend to\\nHarriet Smith, Emma.  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far,\\nif he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.\\nI know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,\\nhe is the farthest from it of any man I know.  Depend upon it he\\nhad encouragement.\"\\n\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.\\n\\n\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\nare unjust to Harriet.  Harriet\\'s claims to marry well are not\\nso contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl,\\nbut she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not\\ndeserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.\\nWaiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you\\ndescribe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in\\nthe degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations\\nto the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,\\nand must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;\\nand till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject\\nof beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\\nin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,\\nwith such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired\\nand sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,\\nconsequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very\\nslight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness\\nof temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great\\nreadiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken\\nif your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,\\nthe highest claims a woman could possess.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,\\nis almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,\\nthan misapply it as you do.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully.  \"I know _that_ is the feeling\\nof you all.  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly\\nwhat every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses\\nand satisfies his judgment.  Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.\\nWere you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.\\nAnd is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning\\nto be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first\\noffer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her.\"\\n\\n\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley\\npresently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.\\nYou will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what\\nshe has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her\\nreach will be good enough for her.  Vanity working on a weak head,\\nproduces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady\\nto raise her expectations too high.  Miss Harriet Smith may not find\\noffers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.\\nMen of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.\\nMen of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves\\nwith a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be\\nafraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,\\nwhen the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry\\nRobert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;\\nbut if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach\\nher to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence\\nand large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nall the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a\\ngirl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,\\nand is glad to catch at the old writing-master\\'s son.\"\\n\\n\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,\\nthat there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making\\neach other more angry.  But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin,\\nit is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,\\nas must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil\\nof having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,\\nI will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;\\nbut I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.\\nHis appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,\\nthat if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.\\nI can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,\\nshe might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,\\nand he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\\nnobody better (that must have been his great assistant)\\nshe might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.\\nBut the case is altered now.  She knows now what gentlemen are;\\nand nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\nwith Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\" cried Mr. Knightley.--\"Robert\\nMartin\\'s manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend\\nthem; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.\"\\n\\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.\\nShe did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself\\na better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\\ncould be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\\nin general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;\\nand to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,\\nwas very disagreeable.  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,\\nwith only one attempt on Emma\\'s side to talk of the weather,\\nbut he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts\\nappeared at last in these words.\\n\\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I\\nhope it will not be long before he does.  Your views for Harriet\\nare best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love\\nof match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,\\nand projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you\\nthat if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\"\\n\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed.  He continued,\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do.  Elton is a very good sort of man,\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely\\nto make an imprudent match.  He knows the value of a good income\\nas well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will\\nact rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you\\ncan be with Harriet\\'s. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,\\nand a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way\\nof talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,\\nI am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.\\nI have heard him speak with great animation of a large family\\nof young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all\\ntwenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again.\\n\"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton\\'s marrying Harriet, it would\\nhave been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want\\nto keep Harriet to myself.  I have done with match-making indeed.\\nI could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave\\noff while I am well.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.\\nHe was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,\\nand was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the\\nsanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had\\ntaken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.\\n\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of her\\'s, than in his.  She did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversary\\'s wrong, as Mr. Knightley.\\nHe walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.\\nShe was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little\\ntime and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.\\nHarriet\\'s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.\\nThe possibility of the young man\\'s coming to Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nthat morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,\\ngave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the\\nprominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,\\nand without having any such reason to give for her long absence,\\nshe felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,\\nand convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,\\nshe had done nothing which woman\\'s friendship and woman\\'s feelings\\nwould not justify.\\n\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,\\nneither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,\\nin spite of Mr. Knightley\\'s pretensions) with the skill of such\\nan observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it\\nhastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather\\nsaid what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew\\nany thing about.  He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak\\nwith more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not\\nbe of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;\\nhe might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;\\nbut then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence\\nof a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley\\nsaw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;\\nbut she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;\\nand more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very\\nsure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\\n\\nHarriet\\'s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,\\nnot to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash\\nhad been telling her something, which she repeated immediately\\nwith great delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard\\'s to attend\\na sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,\\nthat as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met\\nMr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was\\nactually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till\\nthe morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been\\nnever known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him\\nabout it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,\\nto absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off\\nhis journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been\\ndetermined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed,\\nthat he was going on business which he would not put off for any\\ninducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,\\nand being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry\\ncould not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must\\nbe a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only\\nlooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\\nMiss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more\\nabout Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,\\nbut she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,\\nshe should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,\\nMr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel\\nwith herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than\\nusual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,\\nhis grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry,\\nbut could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings\\nwere more and more justified and endeared to her by the general\\nappearances of the next few days.\\n\\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after\\nMr. Elton\\'s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\\nof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet\\'s feelings, they were\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment\\nas her youth and sort of mind admitted.  Emma was soon perfectly\\nsatisfied of Mr. Martin\\'s being no otherwise remembered, than as\\nhe furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\\n\\nHer views of improving her little friend\\'s mind, by a great deal\\nof useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than\\na few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.\\nIt was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let\\nher imagination range and work at Harriet\\'s fortune, than to be\\nlabouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;\\nand the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,\\nthe only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,\\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\\nthat she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,\\nmade up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.\\n\\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale\\nare not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\\nhad written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken\\nthe first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse\\'s help,\\nto get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,\\nmemory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,\\nit was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form\\nas well as quantity.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,\\nand tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.\\n\"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\"\\nAnd it always ended in \"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\"\\n\\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;\\nbut he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about\\nso much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\\n\\nIt was by no means his daughter\\'s wish that the intellects of\\nHighbury in general should be put under requisition.  Mr. Elton\\nwas the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited\\nto contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums\\nthat he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him\\nmost intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,\\nas she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,\\nnothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass\\nhis lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;\\nand the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,\\nand rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\\n\\n    My first doth affliction denote,\\n      Which my second is destin\\'d to feel\\n    And my whole is the best antidote\\n      That affliction to soften and heal.--\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it\\nsome pages ago already.\\n\\n\"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\" said she;\\n\"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\\neasier to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind\\nin his life.  The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss\\nWoodhouse\"--he stopt a moment--\"or Miss Smith could inspire him.\"\\n\\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.\\nHe called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the\\ntable containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had\\naddressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,\\nfrom his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\\n\\n\"I do not offer it for Miss Smith\\'s collection,\" said he.\\n\"Being my friend\\'s, I have no right to expose it in any degree\\nto the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\"\\n\\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma\\ncould understand.  There was deep consciousness about him,\\nand he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend\\'s.\\nHe was gone the next moment:--after another moment\\'s pause,\\n\\n\"Take it,\" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\\nHarriet--\"it is for you.  Take your own.\"\\n\\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,\\nnever loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\\n\\n        To Miss--\\n\\n          CHARADE.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n    Another view of man, my second brings,\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\n    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\\n      Man\\'s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion\\nof hope and dulness, \"Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.\\nI have read worse charades.  _Courtship_--a very good hint.  I give\\nyou credit for it.  This is feeling your way.  This is saying very\\nplainly--`Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you.\\nApprove my charade and my intentions in the same glance.\\'\\n\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nHarriet exactly.  Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets,\\nthe justest that could be given.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\\n\\nHumph--Harriet\\'s ready wit! All the better.  A man must be very much\\nin love, indeed, to describe her so.  Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish\\nyou had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you.\\nFor once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken.\\nAn excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.\\nThings must come to a crisis soon now.\\n\\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\neagerness of Harriet\\'s wondering questions.\\n\\n\"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\\ncannot guess it in the least.  What can it possibly be? Do try\\nto find it out, Miss Woodhouse.  Do help me.  I never saw any thing\\nso hard.  Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could\\nbe the young lady.  Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\\n\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nCan it be Neptune?\\n\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only\\none syllable.  It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it.\\nOh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\"\\n\\n\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you\\nthinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made\\nby a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\\n\\nFor Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n\\nThat is _court_.\\n\\n    Another view of man, my second brings;\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nThat is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\\n\\n    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\\n      Man\\'s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nA very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,\\nwhich I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty\\nin comprehending.  Read it in comfort to yourself.  There can\\nbe no doubt of its being written for you and to you.\"\\n\\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion.\\nShe read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.\\nShe could not speak.  But she was not wanted to speak.  It was enough\\nfor her to feel.  Emma spoke for her.\\n\\n\"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\"\\nsaid she, \"that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton\\'s intentions.\\nYou are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof\\nof it.  I thought it must be so.  I thought I could not be so deceived;\\nbut now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,\\nas my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you.\\nYes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance\\nto happen what has happened.  I could never tell whether an attachment\\nbetween you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.\\nIts probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each\\nother! I am very happy.  I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all\\nmy heart.  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride\\nin creating.  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.\\nIt will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,\\na proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,\\nclose to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.\\nThis, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either\\nof us.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Miss Woodhouse!\"--and \"Dear Miss Woodhouse,\" was all that Harriet,\\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they\\ndid arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently\\nclear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered\\njust as she ought.  Mr. Elton\\'s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\\n\\n\"Whatever you say is always right,\" cried Harriet, \"and therefore\\nI suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could\\nnot have imagined it.  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.\\nMr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions\\nabout _him_.  He is so very superior.  Only think of those sweet\\nverses--`To Miss --------.\\' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really\\nbe meant for me?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.\\nIt is a certainty.  Receive it on my judgment.  It is a sort\\nof prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon\\nfollowed by matter-of-fact prose.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.  I am sure,\\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do\\ntake place!\"\\n\\n\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is\\nso evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement\\nof other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong\\nto one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.\\nYour marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.  There does\\nseem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love\\nexactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel\\nwhere it ought to flow.\\n\\n      The course of true love never did run smooth--\\n\\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.\"\\n\\n\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,\\nthe very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body\\nlooks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,\\nthat every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he\\ndoes not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days\\nin the week.  And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down\\nall the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury.\\nDear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little\\ndid I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and\\npeeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss\\nNash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;\\nhowever, she called me back presently, and let me look too,\\nwhich was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!\\nHe was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,\\nmust be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;\\nand we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.  If they\\nare anxious to see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable\\ncharacter gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you\\nsettled in the same country and circle which they have chosen\\nto place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only\\nobject is that you should, in the common phrase, be _well_ married,\\nhere is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,\\nthe rise in the world which must satisfy them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true.  How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.\\nYou understand every thing.  You and Mr. Elton are one as clever\\nas the other.  This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,\\nI could never have made any thing like it.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining\\nit yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\\n\\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\\n\\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour.\\nSuch things in general cannot be too short.\"\\n\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear.  The most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\n\\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\"to\\nhave very good sense in a common way, like every body else,\\nand if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,\\nand say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write\\nverses and charades like this.\"\\n\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin\\'s prose.\\n\\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet--\"these two last!--But\\nhow shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found\\nit out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\\n\\n\"Leave it to me.  You do nothing.  He will be here this evening,\\nI dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense\\nor other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your\\nsoft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.  Trust to me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\\n\\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you\\nshould not write it into your book.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"--\\n\\n--\"The best of all.  Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\\nenjoyment keep them.  They are not at all the less written you know,\\nbecause you divide them.  The couplet does not cease to be, nor does\\nits meaning change.  But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases,\\nand a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.\\nDepend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,\\nmuch better than his passion.  A poet in love must be encouraged in\\nboth capacities, or neither.  Give me the book, I will write it down,\\nand then there can be no possible reflection on you.\"\\n\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down\\na declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any\\ndegree of publicity.\\n\\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer\\nit lasts, the better I shall be pleased.  But here is my father\\ncoming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him.\\nIt will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of\\nthe sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.\\nHe has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must\\nlet me read it to him.\"\\n\\nHarriet looked grave.\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this\\ncharade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are\\ntoo conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,\\nor even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.\\nDo not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.\\nIf he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper\\nwhile I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you.\\nDo not let us be too solemn on the business.  He has encouragement\\nenough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.  Do as you please.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,\\nby the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears,\\nhow does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.\\nA piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,\\nwe suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we\\nhave just copied it in.\"\\n\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,\\nslowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations\\nof every part as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and,\\nas she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\n\\n\"Aye, that\\'s very just, indeed, that\\'s very properly said.\\nVery true.  `Woman, lovely woman.\\' It is such a pretty charade,\\nmy dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody\\ncould have written so prettily, but you, Emma.\"\\n\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,\\nand a very tender sigh, he added,\\n\\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I\\ncan remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you\\nhave heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;\\nand there are several.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\n      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\\n    The hood-wink\\'d boy I called to aid,\\n    Though of his near approach afraid,\\n      So fatal to my suit before.\\n\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever\\nall the way through.  But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.  We copied it\\nfrom the Elegant Extracts.  It was Garrick\\'s, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\n\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near\\nbeing christened Catherine after her grandmama.  I hope we shall\\nhave her here next week.  Have you thought, my dear, where you\\nshall put her--and what room there will be for the children?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,\\nyou know.  Why should there be any change?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley\\'s\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly\\ntaken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,\\nnot to see Miss Taylor here!\"\\n\\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear.  I am sure I was very much surprized\\nwhen I first heard she was going to be married.\"\\n\\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella\\nis here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\\nis coming for only one week.  There will not be time for any thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case\\nof necessity.  Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th,\\nand we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole\\nof the time they can give to the country, that two or three days\\nare not to be taken out for the Abbey.  Mr. Knightley promises\\nto give up his claim this Christmas--though you know it is longer\\nsince they were with him, than with us.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were\\nto be anywhere but at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley\\'s claims on\\nhis brother, or any body\\'s claims on Isabella, except his own.\\nHe sat musing a little while, and then said,\\n\\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back\\nso soon, though he does.  I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade\\nher to stay longer with us.  She and the children might stay very well.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,\\nand I do not think you ever will.  Isabella cannot bear to stay\\nbehind her husband.\"\\n\\nThis was too true for contradiction.  Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits\\naffected by the idea of his daughter\\'s attachment to her husband,\\nshe immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\n\\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while\\nmy brother and sister are here.  I am sure she will be pleased\\nwith the children.  We are very proud of the children, are not we,\\npapa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they\\nwill be to come.  They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say they are, sir.  I am sure I do not know who is not.\"\\n\\n\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.  Henry is the eldest,\\nhe was named after me, not after his father.  John, the second,\\nis named after his father.  Some people are surprized, I believe,\\nthat the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,\\nwhich I thought very pretty of her.  And he is a very clever boy,\\nindeed.  They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many\\npretty ways.  They will come and stand by my chair, and say,\\n`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?\\' and once Henry asked me\\nfor a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.\\nI think their father is too rough with them very often.\"\\n\\n\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very\\ngentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,\\nyou would not think him rough.  He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;\\nand if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;\\nbut he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley\\nis an affectionate father.  The children are all fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling\\nin a very frightful way!\"\\n\\n\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.\\nIt is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down\\nthe rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way\\nto the other.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"\\n\\n\"That is the case with us all, papa.  One half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\"\\n\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\\nin preparation for the regular four o\\'clock dinner, the hero\\nof this inimitable charade walked in again.  Harriet turned away;\\nbut Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye\\nsoon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of\\nhaving thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it\\nmight turn up.  His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s party could be made up in the evening without him,\\nor whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.\\nIf he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend\\nCole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made\\nsuch a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.\\n\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his\\nfriend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.\\nHe re-urged--she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make\\nhis bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--\\n\\n\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\\nthank you for the sight of it.  We admired it so much, that I have\\nventured to write it into Miss Smith\\'s collection.  Your friend\\nwill not take it amiss I hope.  Of course I have not transcribed\\nbeyond the first eight lines.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.\\nHe looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about\\n\"honour,\"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book\\nopen on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.\\nWith the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\n\\n\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\\nmust not be confined to one or two.  He may be sure of every woman\\'s\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"\\n\\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in saying--at\\nleast if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest\\ndoubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it,\\n(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he\\nwould consider it as the proudest moment of his life.\"\\n\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible.  Emma could not\\nthink it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,\\nthere was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt\\nto incline her to laugh.  She ran away to indulge the inclination,\\nleaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet\\'s share.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather\\nto prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;\\nand on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor\\nsick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.\\n\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode\\nof Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,\\nand then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,\\nan old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it\\ncould be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much\\nsmartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,\\nthere could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without\\na slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma\\'s remark was--\\n\\n\"There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.\"--\\nHarriet\\'s was--\\n\\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\\n\\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards\\nof this part of Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\\nand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,\\nwith Mr. Elton\\'s seeing ready wit in her.\\n\\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think\\nof any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want\\nto inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\"\\n\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence\\nof some minutes, Harriet thus began again--\\n\\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,\\nor going to be married! so charming as you are!\"--\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\n\\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\nI must find other people charming--one other person at least.\\nAnd I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have\\nvery little intention of ever marrying at all.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,\\nto be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)\\nis out of the question:  and I do _not_ wish to see any such person.\\nI would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better.\\nIf I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"--\\n\\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.\\nWere I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!\\nbut I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;\\nand I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I\\nshould be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I\\ndo not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:\\nI believe few married women are half as much mistress of their\\nhusband\\'s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect\\nto be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always\\nright in any man\\'s eyes as I am in my father\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\\n\\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--\\nso smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--\\nand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,\\nI would marry to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never\\ncan be any likeness, except in being unmarried.\"\\n\\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that\\'s so dreadful!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is\\npoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!\\nA single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,\\ndisagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,\\nbut a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,\\nand may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the\\ndistinction is not quite so much against the candour and common\\nsense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income\\nhas a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\\nThose who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,\\nand generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.\\nThis does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good\\nnatured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.\\nPoverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,\\nif she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely\\nto give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a\\ngreat charm.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself\\nwhen you grow old?\"\\n\\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be\\nmore in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.\\nWoman\\'s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\\nas they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,\\nI shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.\\nAnd as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,\\nwhich is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which\\nis really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall\\nbe very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,\\nto care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,\\nto supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.\\nThere will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my\\nattachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas\\nof comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews\\nand nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know Miss Bates\\'s niece?  That is, I know you must have\\nseen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes\\nto Highbury.  By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out\\nof conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should\\never bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,\\nas she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name\\nof Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;\\nher compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she\\ndoes but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair\\nof garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.\\nI wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.\"\\n\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics\\nwere superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses\\nof the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention\\nand kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.\\nShe understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and\\ntheir temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary\\nvirtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into\\ntheir troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance\\nwith as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,\\nit was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;\\nand after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,\\nshe quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\\nas made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\n\\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they\\nmake every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of\\nnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,\\nwho can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" said Harriet.  \"Poor creatures! one can think\\nof nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\"\\nsaid Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep\\nwhich ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,\\nand brought them into the lane again.  \"I do not think it will,\"\\nstopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,\\nand recall the still greater within.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.\\n\\nThey walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend\\nwas passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near\\nas to give Emma time only to say farther,\\n\\n\"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability\\nin good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that\\nif compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,\\nit has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,\\nenough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,\\nonly distressing to ourselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\\njoined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,\\nwere the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call\\non them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very\\ninteresting parley about what could be done and should be done.\\nMr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.\\n\\n\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\\n\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring\\non the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were\\nanywhere else.\"\\n\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised\\non one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.\\nBut she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet\\'s\\nhabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,\\nin short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;\\nshe immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration\\nto make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete\\noccupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,\\nand she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;\\nand by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,\\nshe had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken\\nby a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,\\nwith her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side\\nof this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural\\nthing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been\\nacting just then without design; and by this means the others were\\nstill able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.\\nShe gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child\\'s pace was quick,\\nand theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,\\nfrom their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.\\nMr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very\\npleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning\\nto think how she might draw back a little more, when they both\\nlooked around, and she was obliged to join them.\\n\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday\\'s\\nparty at his friend Cole\\'s, and that she was come in herself for\\nthe Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,\\nthe beet-root, and all the dessert.\\n\\n\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love;\\nand any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.\\nIf I could but have kept longer away!\"\\n\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into\\nthe house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace\\noff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently\\nobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to\\nput herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\n\\n\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am\\nto contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,\\nbut I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg\\nleave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit\\nof ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\\nhis house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.\\nThe room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,\\nand looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately\\ncommunicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed\\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\\ncomfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\\nfound it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.\\nIt was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging\\nthe housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it\\npracticable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.\\nFor ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could\\nbe protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,\\nand make her appearance.\\n\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a\\nmost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory\\nof having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not\\ncome to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;\\nhe had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely\\nfollowed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,\\nbut nothing serious.\\n\\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch,\\nand will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\\n\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished\\nby her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself\\nthat it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,\\nand must be leading them forward to the great event.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma\\'s\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.\\nThe coming of her sister\\'s family was so very near at hand,\\nthat first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth\\nher prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay\\nat Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--\\nthat any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could\\nbe afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly\\nif they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether\\nthey would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.\\nThere are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will\\ndo for themselves.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual\\nabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the\\nusual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their\\nmarriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;\\nbut all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing\\nfor the children, and it was therefore many months since they had\\nbeen seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all\\nby Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,\\neven for poor Isabella\\'s sake; and who consequently was now most\\nnervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.\\n\\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\\nbring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms\\nwere needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,\\nand Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent\\nnumber of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.\\nThe bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,\\nwelcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,\\nproduced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\\nunder any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;\\nbut the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were\\nso respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,\\nand for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,\\nall the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,\\nthe children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,\\neither in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.\\n\\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,\\nand so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for\\nthese higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.\\nShe could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman\\nof strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance\\nof her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;\\nwas delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,\\nhad many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield\\nin town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,\\nin a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard\\nfor every old acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his\\nprivate character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.\\nHe was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross\\nas to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his\\ngreat perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,\\nit was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\\nbe increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.\\nHe had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,\\nand he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\\n\\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing\\nwrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little\\ninjuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.\\nPerhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\\nflattering to Isabella\\'s sister, but they were only those of a calmly\\nkind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;\\nbut hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\\nregardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\\nfell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.\\nThere he had not always the patience that could have been wished.\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\\nhim to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.\\nIt did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great\\nregard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was\\ndue to him; but it was too often for Emma\\'s charity, especially as\\nthere was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,\\nthough the offence came not.  The beginning, however, of every visit\\ndisplayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity\\nso short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\\nThey had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter\\'s\\nattention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\\n\\n\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must\\nmiss her!  And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--\\nI have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could\\npossibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope\\nshe is pretty well, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know\\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--\\nnever looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"\\n\\n\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.\\n\\n\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella\\nin the plaintive tone which just suited her father.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\\nthey married.  Either in the morning or evening of every day,\\nexcepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,\\nand generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you\\nmay suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.  They are very,\\nvery kind in their visits.  Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.\\nPapa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving\\nIsabella a false idea of us all.  Every body must be aware that Miss\\nTaylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured\\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any\\nmeans to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.\"\\n\\n\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\\nit was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could\\nnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\\nall easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea\\nof the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;\\nand now you have Emma\\'s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot deny\\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--\\nbut then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--\\nYou quite forget poor Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston\\nhas some little claim.  You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part\\nof the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,\\nthe claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.\\nAs for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience\\nof putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\\n\\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\\n\"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,\\na greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been\\nfor the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought\\nof Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;\\nand as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the\\nvery best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself\\nand your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall\\nnever forget his flying Henry\\'s kite for him that very windy day\\nlast Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September\\ntwelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o\\'clock at night,\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,\\nI have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\\na better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be\\nMiss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley.  \"Has he been here\\non this occasion--or has he not?\"\\n\\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma.  \"There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended\\nin nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\\n\\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.\\n\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,\\nand a very proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me.\\nI thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea\\nyou know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\\n\\n\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--\\nand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,\\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was\\nan exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\na great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,\\nand dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,\\' but I forget\\nhow it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.\\'--\\nI remember that perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\nKnightley.  \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.\\nBut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!\\nThere is something so shocking in a child\\'s being taken away from his\\nparents and natural home!  I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston\\ncould part with him.  To give up one\\'s child!  I really never\\ncould think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\"\\nobserved Mr. John Knightley coolly.  \"But you need not imagine\\nMr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry\\nor John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,\\nthan a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,\\nand makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,\\nmuch more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,\\nupon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his\\nneighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any\\nthing that home affords.\"\\n\\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,\\nand had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let\\nit pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was\\nsomething honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,\\nthe all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother\\'s\\ndisposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,\\nand those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination\\nof Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him\\nin Isabella\\'s first day.  Emma\\'s sense of right however had decided it;\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,\\nshe had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late\\ndisagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him\\nthe proper invitation.\\n\\nShe hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it\\nwas time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  _She_ certainly\\nhad not been in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had.\\nConcession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear\\nto forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather\\nassist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room\\nshe had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl\\nabout eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,\\nand very happy to be danced about in her aunt\\'s arms.  It did assist;\\nfor though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon\\nled on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child\\nout of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.\\nEmma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving\\nher at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,\\nshe could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,\\n\\n\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"\\n\\n\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men\\nand women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your\\ndealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,\\nwe might always think alike.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being\\nin the wrong.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good.  I was sixteen years\\nold when you were born.\"\\n\\n\"A material difference then,\" she replied--\"and no doubt you were\\nmuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does\\nnot the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings\\na good deal nearer?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\"\\n\\n\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,\\nif we think differently.\"\\n\\n\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years\\' experience, and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.  Come, my dear Emma,\\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it.  Tell your aunt, little Emma,\\nthat she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" she cried--\"very true.  Little Emma, grow up\\na better woman than your aunt.  Be infinitely cleverer and not\\nhalf so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I\\nhave done.  As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right,\\nand I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet\\nproved wrong.  I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,\\nvery bitterly disappointed.\"\\n\\n\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.\\n\\n\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"\\n\\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\\nKnightley made his appearance, and \"How d\\'ye do, George?\" and \"John,\\nhow are you?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under\\na calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment\\nwhich would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing\\nfor the good of the other.\\n\\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined\\ncards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\\ndear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;\\non one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;\\ntheir subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma\\nonly occasionally joining in one or the other.\\n\\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\\nand who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,\\nsome curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand\\nthe home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear\\nnext year, and to give all such local information as could not fail\\nof being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\\nthe longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.\\nThe plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,\\nand the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,\\nwas entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his\\ncooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever\\nleft him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached\\na tone of eagerness.\\n\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying\\na full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\n\\n\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand,\\nand interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one\\nof her five children--\"How long it is, how terribly long since you\\nwere here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must\\ngo to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you\\nbefore you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.\\nMy dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\"\\n\\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,\\nthat both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article\\nas herself;--and two basins only were ordered.  After a little\\nmore discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its\\nnot being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,\\nwith an air of grave reflection,\\n\\n\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn\\nat South End instead of coming here.  I never had much opinion\\nof the sea air.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we\\nshould not have gone.  He recommended it for all the children,\\nbut particularly for the weakness in little Bella\\'s throat,--\\nboth sea air and bathing.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her\\nany good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,\\nthough perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very\\nrarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea.  It makes me envious and miserable;--\\nI who have never seen it!  South End is prohibited, if you please.\\nMy dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about\\nMr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well.  Poor Perry is bilious,\\nand he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has\\nnot time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is\\nalways wanted all round the country.  I suppose there is not a man\\nin such practice anywhere.  But then there is not so clever a man\\nany where.\"\\n\\n\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\\nI have a great regard for Mr. Perry.  I hope he will be calling soon.\\nHe will be so pleased to see my little ones.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence.  And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella\\'s throat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly\\nany uneasiness about it.  Either bathing has been of the greatest\\nservice to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\\nembrocation of Mr. Wingfield\\'s, which we have been applying\\nat times ever since August.\"\\n\\n\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been\\nof use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,\\nI would have spoken to--\\n\\n\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma,\\n\"I have not heard one inquiry after them.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you\\nmention them in most of your letters.  I hope they are quite well.\\nGood old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take\\nmy children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--\\nAnd that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--\\nHow are they, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.  But poor Mrs. Bates\\nhad a bad cold about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"How sorry I am!  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn.  Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them\\nmore general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\\n\\n\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree\\nyou mention.  Perry says that colds have been very general,\\nbut not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.\\nPerry does not call it altogether a sickly season.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except--\\n\\n\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\\na sickly season.  Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.\\nIt is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--\\nand the air so bad!\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air.  Our part of London is\\nvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\\nin general, my dear sir.  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square\\nis very different from almost all the rest.  We are so very airy!\\nI should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--\\nthere is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my\\nchildren in:  but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks\\nthe vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as\\nto air.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--\\nbut after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you\\ndifferent creatures; you do not look like the same.  Now I cannot say,\\nthat I think you are any of you looking well at present.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were\\na little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness\\nof coming.  I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;\\nfor I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe\\nhe had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.  I trust,\\nat least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\"\\nturning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\n\\n\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.  I think Mr. John\\nKnightley very far from looking well.\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you\\nlooking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.\\nI could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen\\nMr. Wingfield before you left home.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern\\nyourself about my looks.  Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\\nyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\\n\\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham\\'s intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate.  What will it answer?\\nWill not the old prejudice be too strong?\"\\n\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\nworse to hear than Isabella\\'s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;\\nand Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,\\nshe was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.\\n\\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.--\\n\"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town!  What happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!\\nI always regret excessively on dear Emma\\'s account that she cannot\\nbe more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose\\nColonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.\\nShe would be such a delightful companion for Emma.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\n\\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another\\npretty kind of young person.  You will like Harriet.  Emma could\\nnot have a better companion than Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be\\nso very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma\\'s age.\"\\n\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of\\nsimilar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening\\ndid not close without a little return of agitation.  The gruel came\\nand supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--\\nundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,\\nand pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was\\nnever met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures\\nwhich the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore\\nmost prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman\\nhired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she\\nmeant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.\\nOften as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able\\nto get any thing tolerable.  Here was a dangerous opening.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\\nher with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma\\'s ear expressed,\\n\"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to\\nSouth End.  It does not bear talking of.\"  And for a little while\\nshe hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination\\nmight suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.\\nAfter an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,\\n\\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\ninstead of coming here.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children\\na great deal of good.\"\\n\\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not\\nhave been to South End.  South End is an unhealthy place.\\nPerry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.\"\\n\\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is\\nquite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,\\nnever found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield\\nsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;\\nand I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands\\nthe nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been\\nthere repeatedly.\"\\n\\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--\\nPerry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best\\nof all the sea-bathing places.  A fine open sea, he says, and very\\npure air.  And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there\\nquite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.\\nYou should have consulted Perry.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much\\nto chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get\\ninto a worse air.  This is just what Perry said.  It seemed to him\\na very ill-judged measure.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\\nhad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\nbrother-in-law\\'s breaking out.\\n\\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,\\n\"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.\\nWhy does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--\\nat my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may\\nbe allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--\\nI want his directions no more than his drugs.\"  He paused--\\nand growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness,\\n\"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children\\na distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense\\nor inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to\\nprefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\\n\"very true.  That\\'s a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I\\nwas telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning\\nit more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,\\nI cannot conceive any difficulty.  I should not attempt it,\\nif it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,\\nbut if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .\\nThe only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.\\nI shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we\\nwill look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on\\nhis friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,\\nbeen attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--\\nbut the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed\\nthe present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother,\\nand better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking\\nover what she had done every evening with her father and sister.\\nShe had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass\\nso swiftly.  It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\\n\\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\\ntheir mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out\\nof the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.\\nMr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls\\none day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible\\nthing in preference to a division of the party.\\n\\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty\\nif he could, but as his son and daughter\\'s carriage and horses\\nwere actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than\\na simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;\\nnor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one\\nof the carriages find room for Harriet also.\\n\\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,\\nwere the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,\\nas well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse\\'s habits and inclination\\nbeing consulted in every thing.\\n\\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event\\nthat Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been\\nspent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed\\nwith a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\\nby Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.\\nEmma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed\\nwith regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad\\nsore throat:  Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry\\nwas talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist\\nthe authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,\\nthough she could not speak of her loss without many tears.\\n\\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\\nMr. Elton\\'s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her\\nat last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having\\na most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.\\nShe had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard\\'s door, when she\\nwas met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as\\nthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--\\nof whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going\\nto inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--\\nthey were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the\\ndaily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,\\nglowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed\\nto ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they\\nwere hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together.\\nEmma was just describing the nature of her friend\\'s complaint;--\\n\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,\\na quick, low pulse, &c.  and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard\\nthat Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\nalarmed her with them.\"  Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,\\nas he exclaimed,\\n\\n\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care\\nof yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run\\nno risks.  Why does not Perry see her?\"\\n\\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard\\'s experience\\nand care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness\\nwhich she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather\\nfeed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite\\nanother subject,\\n\\n\"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much\\nlike snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,\\nI should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father\\nfrom venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem\\nto feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it\\nwould be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon\\nmy word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.\\nYou appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider\\nwhat demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,\\nI think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home\\nand take care of yourself to-night.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of\\nher\\'s, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--\\nbut Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\\nand views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,\\nwas very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\\nbeing \"very cold, certainly very cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in\\nhaving extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power\\nof sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.\\n\\n\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies\\nto Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\"\\n\\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton\\'s\\nonly objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much\\nprompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,\\nand never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than\\nat this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes\\nmore exulting than when he next looked at her.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I\\nhad got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave\\nHarriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,\\nin many men, especially single men, such an inclination--\\nsuch a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in\\nthe class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,\\nalmost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must\\nbe the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young\\nman undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,\\nhe cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.\\nWhat a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,\\nbut will not dine alone for her.\"\\n\\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\\nin his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his\\nvoice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nfor news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared\\nfor the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be\\nable to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself\\noff in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\nMr. Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.\\nWith men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies\\nto please, every feature works.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton\\'s manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\\na great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,\\nhe will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is\\nsuch perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot\\nbut value.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,\\n\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining\\nme to be Mr. Elton\\'s object?\"\\n\\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"\\n\\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether\\nit is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.\\nI think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,\\nEmma.  You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,\\nand what you mean to do.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton\\nand I are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on,\\namusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\\narise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes\\nwhich people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;\\nand not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\\nand ignorant, and in want of counsel.  He said no more.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,\\nthat in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea\\nof shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually\\nwith his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent\\nconsciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full\\nof the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at\\nRandalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.\\nThe cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage\\nwas in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,\\nand the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\\na milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.\\n\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.\\nThe preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice\\nof his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;\\nand the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\\nexpressing his discontent.\\n\\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when\\nhe asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such\\na day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think\\nhimself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.\\nIt is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--\\nThe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the\\nfolly of people\\'s not staying comfortably at home when they can!\\nIf we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of\\nduty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,\\nprobably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward\\nvoluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,\\nwhich tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,\\nto stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--\\nhere are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\\nman\\'s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses\\nand four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,\\nshivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they\\nmight have had at home.\"\\n\\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt\\nhe was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"Very true, my love,\"\\nwhich must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;\\nbut she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer\\nat all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;\\nher heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk,\\nand arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.\\n\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,\\nand Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.\\nEmma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  Mr. Elton\\nwas all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful\\nin his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have\\nreceived a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.\\nShe had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same--\\nnot better.\"\\n\\n\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\" said she presently, \"was not\\nso pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better\\' was _my_ answer.\"\\n\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice\\nof sentiment as he answered.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard\\'s door, which I did the very last thing\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned--\\nI had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial\\nas I knew had been given her in the morning.\"\\n\\nEmma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part\\nof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\\nit is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her,\\nas you probably heard.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"\\n\\n\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"\\n\\n\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"\\n\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;\\nbut it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when\\nonly half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\n\\n\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin\\nfor carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to\\nfeel cold with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days\\nindeed have rendered a gentleman\\'s carriage perfectly complete.\\nOne is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath\\nof air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely\\nof no consequence.  It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage\\nwe know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal\\nof it.\"\\n\\n\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton.  \"Quite seasonable;\\nand extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not\\nbegin yesterday, and prevent this day\\'s party, which it might very\\npossibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had\\nthere been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.\\nThis is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas\\nevery body invites their friends about them, and people think little\\nof even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend\\'s house once\\nfor a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,\\nand could not get away till that very day se\\'nnight.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,\\nbut said only, coolly,\\n\\n\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"\\n\\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too\\nmuch astonished now at Mr. Elton\\'s spirits for other feelings.\\nHarriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\\n\\n\"We are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing\\nin the greatest comfort.  Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--\\nMrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly\\nwhat one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--\\nit will be a small party, but where small parties are select,\\nthey are perhaps the most agreeable of any.  Mr. Weston\\'s dining-room\\ndoes not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,\\nI would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than\\nexceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft\\nair to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\\nthough Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties\\nof London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine\\nwith any body.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the\\nlaw had been so great a slavery.  Well, sir, the time must come\\nwhen you will be paid for all this, when you will have little\\nlabour and great enjoyment.\"\\n\\n\"My first enjoyment,\" replied John Knightley, as they passed through\\nthe sweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\\nas they walked into Mrs. Weston\\'s drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must\\ncompose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his\\nill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,\\nto fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,\\nand shew herself just as happy as she was.  To her it was real\\nenjoyment to be with the Westons.  Mr. Weston was a great favourite,\\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\\nsuch unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related\\nwith such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being\\nalways interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,\\narrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.\\nShe could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not\\na lively concern; and half an hour\\'s uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\\nlife depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\\n\\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day\\'s visit might\\nnot afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;\\nbut the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice\\nwas grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as\\npossible of Mr. Elton\\'s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,\\nand enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.\\n\\nThe misfortune of Harriet\\'s cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long\\nenough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own\\nand Isabella\\'s coming, and of Emma\\'s being to follow, and had indeed\\njust got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come\\nand see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,\\nwho had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,\\nwas able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.\\n\\nEmma\\'s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was\\nclose to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange\\ninsensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat\\nat her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\\non her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.\\nInstead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could\\nnot avoid the internal suggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother\\nimagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\\nhis affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"--\\nYet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be\\nso interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;\\nand at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\\nand so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,\\nand made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.\\nFor her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet\\'s, in the hope\\nthat all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;\\nbut it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst\\nthe others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton\\'s nonsense,\\nwhich she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough\\nto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;\\nshe heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\"\\nrepeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables\\nvery much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\\nhis son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was\\nso completely past that any reviving question from her would have\\nbeen awkward.\\n\\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma\\'s resolution of never marrying,\\nthere was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nwhich always interested her.  She had frequently thought--especially since\\nhis father\\'s marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she _were_ to marry,\\nhe was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.\\nHe seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.\\nShe could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\\nthem must think of.  That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was\\nvery strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,\\nor by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more\\nreplete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great\\ncuriosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,\\nof being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure\\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends\\' imaginations.\\n\\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton\\'s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling\\nvery cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\\npossibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,\\nor the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--\\nfor when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\nof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,\\nto say to her,\\n\\n\"We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should\\nlike to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,\\nand my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.\\nI believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room\\nthat we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,\\nand he will be with us within a fortnight.\"\\n\\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented\\nto his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making\\ntheir party quite complete.\\n\\n\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston,\\n\"ever since September:  every letter has been full of it;\\nbut he cannot command his own time.  He has those to please\\nwho must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes\\nto be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.  But now\\nI have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.\"\\n\\n\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston\\nis so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost\\nas happy as yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another\\nput-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:\\nbut she does not know the parties so well as I do.  The case,\\nyou see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:  I did not mention\\na syllable of it in the other room.  There are secrets in all families,\\nyou know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay\\na visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank\\'s coming depends upon\\ntheir being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.\\nBut I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,\\nof some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:\\nand though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\\nthree years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\\nI have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident\\nof seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am\\nof being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding\\ntowards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,\\nand has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot\\ncalculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice\\nof doing.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"\\nreplied Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you\\nthink he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been\\nat the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow\\nmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank\\'s account; for I do believe\\nher to be very fond of him.  I used to think she was not capable\\nof being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been\\nkind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,\\nand expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,\\nin my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;\\nfor, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more\\nheart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.\"\\n\\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--\\nyet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very\\nglad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\\nat the time talked of:  \"for I cannot depend upon his coming.\\nI cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid\\nthat it will all end in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been\\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour\\nof Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain\\nthing in the world.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty\\nof caprice?\"  Then turning to Isabella, who had not been\\nattending before--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,\\nthat we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nin my opinion, as his father thinks.  It depends entirely upon\\nhis aunt\\'s spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.\\nTo you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.\\nMrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;\\nand his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\"\\nreplied Isabella:  \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young\\nman without the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living\\nwith an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.  It is what we\\nhappily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life\\nof misery.  What a blessing, that she never had any children!\\nPoor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\"\\n\\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.  She should then have\\nheard more:  Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.\\nBut at present there was nothing more to be said.  Mr. Woodhouse\\nvery soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting\\nlong after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.\\nNeither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did\\nhe move to those with whom he was always comfortable.\\n\\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity\\nof saying,\\n\\n\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\\nmeans certain.  I am sorry for it.  The introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.\\nEven if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still\\nafraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.\\nI cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure\\nthere is a great wish on the Churchills\\' to keep him to themselves.\\nThere is jealousy.  They are jealous even of his regard for his father.\\nIn short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston\\nwere less sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma.  \"If he could stay only a couple\\nof days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\\'s\\nnot having it in his power to do as much as that.  A young _woman_,\\nif she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance\\nfrom those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young\\n_man_\\'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week\\nwith his father, if he likes it.\"\\n\\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston.\\n\"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the\\nconduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,\\nI believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:\\n_she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.\\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,\\nto whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,\\nto whom she owes nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,\\nto understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must\\nlet it go its own way.  I have no doubt of his having, at times,\\nconsiderable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him\\nto know beforehand _when_ it will be.\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied,\\nunless he comes.\"\\n\\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\"\\ncontinued Mrs. Weston, \"and on others, very little:  and among those,\\non which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be\\nthis very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\\ntea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness\\nof the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  Mr. Weston was\\nchatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;\\nbut at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.\\nMr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.\\nMrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.  He joined\\nthem immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself\\nbetween them.\\n\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind\\nby the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget\\nhis late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,\\nand on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen\\nwith most friendly smiles.\\n\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--\\nher fair, lovely, amiable friend.  \"Did she know?--had she\\nheard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--\\nhe felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her\\ncomplaint alarmed him considerably.\"  And in this style he talked\\non for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,\\nbut altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;\\nand Emma was quite in charity with him.\\n\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,\\nthan on Harriet\\'s--more anxious that she should escape the infection,\\nthan that there should be no infection in the complaint.  He began\\nwith great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting\\nthe sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_\\n_him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry\\nand learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off\\nand bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no\\nputting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.  She was vexed.\\nIt did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence\\nof being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,\\nif real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty\\nin behaving with temper.  He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore\\nher assistance, \"Would not she give him her support?--would not she\\nadd her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\\nto Mrs. Goddard\\'s till it were certain that Miss Smith\\'s disorder\\nhad no infection?  He could not be satisfied without a promise--\\nwould not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\\n\\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless\\nfor herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,\\nand yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\\nsore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us.\\nHave not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support\\nand aid.\"\\n\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston\\'s surprize, and felt that it must be great,\\nat an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself\\nthe right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was\\ntoo much provoked and offended to have the power of directly\\nsaying any thing to the purpose.  She could only give him a look;\\nbut it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,\\nand then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving\\nher all her attention.\\n\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly\\ndid another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came\\ninto the room from examining the weather, and opened on them\\nall with the information of the ground being covered with snow,\\nand of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;\\nconcluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:\\n\\n\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\\nsir.  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making\\ntheir way through a storm of snow.\"\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston\\nand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention\\nfrom his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\n\\n\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing\\nout in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow\\nvery soon.  Every body must have seen the snow coming on.\\nI admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.\\nAnother hour or two\\'s snow can hardly make the road impassable;\\nand we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part\\nof the common field there will be the other at hand.  I dare say we\\nshall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,\\nlest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse\\nfor his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen\\nor likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;\\nhe was afraid they would find no difficulty.  He wished the road might\\nbe impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;\\nand with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might\\nbe found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,\\nthat with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,\\nwhich she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there\\nbeing but two spare rooms in the house.\\n\\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\"\\nwas Mr. Woodhouse\\'s first exclamation, and all that he could say\\nfor some time.  To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances\\nof safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,\\nand of James, and of their having so many friends about them,\\nrevived him a little.\\n\\nHis eldest daughter\\'s alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of\\nbeing blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,\\nwas full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just\\npassable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,\\nshe was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain\\nat Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through\\nall the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\n\\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she;\\n\"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;\\nand if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.\\nI am not at all afraid.  I should not mind walking half the way.\\nI could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not\\nthe sort of thing that gives me cold.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied he.  \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every\\nthing does give you cold.  Walk home!--you are prettily shod\\nfor walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\\n\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.\\nMrs. Weston could only approve.  Isabella then went to Emma;\\nbut Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being\\nall able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,\\nwhen Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his\\nbrother\\'s first report of the snow, came back again, and told them\\nthat he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there\\nnot being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they\\nliked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep--\\nsome way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half\\nan inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;\\na very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,\\nand there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen\\nthe coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing\\nto apprehend.\\n\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they\\nwere scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father\\'s account,\\nwho was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not\\nbe appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued\\nat Randalls.  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:  thus--\\n\\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\\n\\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, do.\"\\n\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.  A few\\nminutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion\\ndeposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other\\nrecover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\n\\nThe carriage came:  and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on\\nsuch occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley\\nand Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some\\nrenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,\\nand the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.\\n\"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.  He was afraid\\npoor Isabella would not like it.  And there would be poor Emma\\nin the carriage behind.  He did not know what they had best do.\\nThey must keep as much together as they could;\" and James was talked to,\\nand given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.\\n\\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\\nand that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.  It would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked\\nto him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have\\nseemed but one.  But now, she would rather it had not happened.\\nShe believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston\\'s good wine,\\nand felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.\\n\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity\\nof the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\\nfound her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,\\nand Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:  availing himself\\nof the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already\\nwell known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;\\nbut flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled\\nlove and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,\\nand in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon\\nas possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple--without apology--\\nwithout much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,\\nwas professing himself _her_ lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly;\\nhe would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of\\nthe moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.\\nShe felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore\\ncould hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.\\nAccordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she\\nhoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,\\n\\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.  This to _me_! you forget yourself--\\nyou take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!\"--\\nAnd he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.  Command yourself\\nenough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,\\nnot at all to confuse his intellects.  He perfectly knew his own meaning;\\nand having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,\\nand slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--\\nbut acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned\\nat all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very\\nurgent for a favourable answer.\\n\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy\\nand presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,\\n\\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made\\nyourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond\\nany thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed\\nduring the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I\\nhave been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me\\nin this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,\\nwhich I had not supposed possible!  Believe me, sir, I am far,\\nvery far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.\"\\n\\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--\\nMiss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course\\nof my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:\\nnever cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.\\nIf she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,\\nand I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse\\nis near!  No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.\\nI have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest\\nattention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done,\\nfor many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my\\nadoration of yourself.  You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.\\nNo!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen\\nand understood me.\"\\n\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--\\nwhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was\\ntoo completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:\\nand two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton\\'s\\nsanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he\\njoyously exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.\\nIt confesses that you have long understood me.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing.  So far from\\nhaving long understood you, I have been in a most complete error\\nwith respect to your views, till this moment.  As to myself, I am\\nvery sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--\\nNothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my\\nfriend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me\\ngreat pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:\\nbut had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,\\nI should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits\\nso frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend\\nyourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought\\nseriously of her?\"\\n\\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn:  \"never, I assure you.\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort\\nof girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.\\nI wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not\\nobject to--Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not,\\nI think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair\\nof an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--\\nNo, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;\\nand the encouragement I received--\"\\n\\n\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer\\nof my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than\\na common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that\\nthe mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued,\\nMiss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;\\nnot being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very\\ngreat inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is,\\nthe disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.\\nI have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\"\\n\\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided\\nto invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,\\nand mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few\\nminutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them\\nto a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have\\nbeen desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left\\nno room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing\\nwhen the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,\\nthey found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;\\nand he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it\\nindispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned,\\ncoldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,\\nshe was then conveyed to Hartfield.\\n\\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,\\nwho had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from\\nVicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--\\nand in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it\\nseemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:\\nfor Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all\\nkindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort\\nof her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin\\nof gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;\\nand the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;\\nand it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\nand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\\nthing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\\nof all.  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort\\nor other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;\\nand she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--\\nmore in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,\\ncould the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\n\\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\\nborne any thing.  He might have doubled his presumption to me--\\nbut poor Harriet!\"\\n\\nHow she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he\\nhad never thought seriously of Harriet--never!  She looked back\\nas well as she could; but it was all confusion.  She had taken\\nup the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.\\nHis manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious,\\nor she could not have been so misled.\\n\\nThe picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--\\nand the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--\\nhow clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.  To be sure,\\nthe charade, with its \"ready wit\"--but then the \"soft eyes\"--\\nin fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.\\nWho could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?\\n\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners\\nto herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,\\nas a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof\\namong others that he had not always lived in the best society,\\nthat with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance\\nwas sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,\\nfor an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect\\nto her as Harriet\\'s friend.\\n\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on\\nthe subject, for the first start of its possibility.  There was\\nno denying that those brothers had penetration.  She remembered\\nwhat Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution\\nhe had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would\\nnever marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer\\na knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she\\nhad reached herself.  It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton\\nwas proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she\\nhad meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full\\nof his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.\\n\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton\\'s wanting\\nto pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.\\nHis professions and his proposals did him no service.  She thought\\nnothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.\\nHe wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his\\neyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy\\nas to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.\\nThere had been no real affection either in his language or manners.\\nSighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\\nhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\\nless allied with real love.  She need not trouble herself to pity him.\\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite\\nso easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss\\nSomebody else with twenty, or with ten.\\n\\nBut--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as\\naware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),\\nto marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion\\nor mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the\\ngradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,\\nas to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--\\nIt was most provoking.\\n\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he\\nwas her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.\\nThe very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;\\nbut he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly\\nhis superior.  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled\\nfor several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch\\nof a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.\\nThe landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,\\nbeing but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all\\nthe rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,\\nwas such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,\\nin every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long\\nheld a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\nMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way\\nas he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing\\nto recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--\\nBut he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must\\nhave been his dependence; and after raving a little about the\\nseeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head,\\nEmma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own\\nbehaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of\\ncourtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived)\\nmight warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy,\\nlike Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.  If _she_\\nhad so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder\\nthat _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.\\n\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish,\\nit was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two\\npeople together.  It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,\\nmaking light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought\\nto be simple.  She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved\\nto do such things no more.\\n\\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being\\nvery much attached to this man.  She might never have thought of him\\nbut for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope,\\nif I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest\\nand humble as I used to think him.  Oh! that I had been satisfied with\\npersuading her not to accept young Martin.  There I was quite right.\\nThat was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left\\nthe rest to time and chance.  I was introducing her into good company,\\nand giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having;\\nI ought not to have attempted more.  But now, poor girl, her peace\\nis cut up for some time.  I have been but half a friend to her;\\nand if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much, I am\\nsure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable\\nfor her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--\\na pert young lawyer.\"\\n\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed\\na more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been,\\nand might be, and must be.  The distressing explanation she had\\nto make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering,\\nwith the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of\\ncontinuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,\\nconcealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy\\nher in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went\\nto bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having\\nblundered most dreadfully.\\n\\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma\\'s, though under\\ntemporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail\\nto bring return of spirits.  The youth and cheerfulness of morning\\nare in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the\\ndistress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they\\nwill be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.\\n\\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had\\ngone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,\\nand to depend on getting tolerably out of it.\\n\\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really\\nin love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking\\nto disappoint him--that Harriet\\'s nature should not be of that\\nsuperior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--\\nand that there could be no necessity for any body\\'s knowing\\nwhat had passed except the three principals, and especially\\nfor her father\\'s being given a moment\\'s uneasiness about it.\\n\\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal\\nof snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was\\nwelcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder\\nat present.\\n\\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,\\nshe could not go to church.  Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable\\nhad his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from\\neither exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.\\nThe ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled\\nstate between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most\\nunfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,\\nand every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most\\nhonourable prisoner.  No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note;\\nno church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no\\nneed to find excuses for Mr. Elton\\'s absenting himself.\\n\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;\\nand though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort\\nin some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father\\nso well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,\\ntoo wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no\\nweather could keep entirely from them,--\\n\\n\"Ah!  Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly\\nsuited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance\\nto his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off\\nhis ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him\\nduring the rest of his stay at Hartfield.  He was always agreeable\\nand obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.  But with all\\nthe hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay,\\nthere was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation\\nwith Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.\\nThe weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;\\nand Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter\\nto stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole\\nparty set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny\\nof poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with\\nthose she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,\\nand always innocently busy, might have been a model of right\\nfeminine happiness.\\n\\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note\\nfrom Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,\\nto say, with Mr. Elton\\'s best compliments, \"that he was proposing\\nto leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;\\nwhere, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,\\nhe had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted\\nthe impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of\\nweather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,\\nof whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--\\nand had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.\"\\n\\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton\\'s absence just\\nat this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired\\nhim for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit\\nfor the manner in which it was announced.  Resentment could not\\nhave been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,\\nfrom which she was so pointedly excluded.  She had not even a\\nshare in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--\\nand there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\\nas she thought, at first, could not escape her father\\'s suspicion.\\n\\nIt did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize\\nof so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get\\nsafely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.\\nIt was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter\\nfor thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.\\nMr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits\\nto persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.\\n\\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.  She had\\nreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was\\ndesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting\\nthe better of her other complaint before the gentleman\\'s return.\\nShe went to Mrs. Goddard\\'s accordingly the very next day, to undergo\\nthe necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--\\nShe had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously\\nfeeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--\\nand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her\\nideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions,\\nall her prophecies for the last six weeks.\\n\\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight\\nof Harriet\\'s tears made her think that she should never be in charity\\nwith herself again.\\n\\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--\\nand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition\\nand lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular\\nadvantage at that moment to her friend.\\n\\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,\\nseemed on Harriet\\'s side, not her own.  Harriet did not consider\\nherself as having any thing to complain of.  The affection of such\\na man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--\\nShe never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial\\nand kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.\\n\\nHer tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless,\\nthat no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma\\'s eyes--\\nand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart\\nand understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was\\nthe superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would\\nbe more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or\\nintelligence could do.\\n\\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded\\nand ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution\\nconfirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination\\nall the rest of her life.  Her second duty now, inferior only to her\\nfather\\'s claims, was to promote Harriet\\'s comfort, and endeavour\\nto prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.\\nShe got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,\\nstriving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,\\nto drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.\\n\\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,\\nand very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\\nin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet\\'s age,\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton\\'s return,\\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\\n\\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;\\nbut yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive\\nagainst an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not\\ncomprehend its continuing very long in equal force.\\n\\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident\\nand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,\\nshe could not imagine Harriet\\'s persisting to place her happiness\\nin the sight or the recollection of him.\\n\\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad\\nfor each, for all three.  Not one of them had the power of removal,\\nor of effecting any material change of society.  They must encounter\\neach other, and make the best of it.\\n\\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers\\nand great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only\\nthat she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling\\nmoderation or repellent truth.  Where the wound had been given,\\nthere must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,\\ntill she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace\\nfor herself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come.  When the time proposed\\ndrew near, Mrs. Weston\\'s fears were justified in the arrival\\nof a letter of excuse.  For the present, he could not be spared,\\nto his \"very great mortification and regret; but still he looked\\nforward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed,\\nin fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the\\nyoung man had been so much more sober:  but a sanguine temper,\\nthough for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not\\nalways pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.\\nIt soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.\\nFor half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he\\nbegan to perceive that Frank\\'s coming two or three months later\\nwould be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;\\nand that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably\\nlonger with them than if he had come sooner.\\n\\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,\\nof a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition\\nof excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband\\nwas to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\\n\\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really\\nabout Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s not coming, except as a disappointment\\nat Randalls.  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.\\nShe wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it\\nwas desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,\\nshe took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,\\nand enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\'s disappointment,\\nas might naturally belong to their friendship.\\n\\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed\\nquite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps\\nrather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.\\nShe then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the\\nadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry;\\nthe pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,\\nwhich the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections\\non the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a\\ndisagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement,\\nperceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her\\nreal opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston\\'s arguments against herself.\\n\\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\ncoolly; \"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know why you should say so.  He wishes exceedingly to come;\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made\\na point of it.  It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\\n\\n\"How odd you are!  What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\"\\n\\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care\\nvery little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with\\nthose who have always set him the example of it.  It is a great deal\\nmore natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up\\nby those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,\\nluxurious, and selfish too.  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see\\nhis father, he would have contrived it between September and January.\\nA man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be\\nwithout the means of doing as much as that.  It is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always\\nbeen your own master.  You are the worst judge in the world,\\nMr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.  You do not know\\nwhat it is to have tempers to manage.\"\\n\\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.  He cannot\\nwant money--he cannot want leisure.  We know, on the contrary,\\nthat he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at\\nthe idlest haunts in the kingdom.  We hear of him for ever at some\\nwatering-place or other.  A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.\\nThis proves that he can leave the Churchills.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\\n\\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;\\nwhenever there is any temptation of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body\\'s conduct, without an\\nintimate knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been\\nin the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties\\nof any individual of that family may be.  We ought to be\\nacquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill\\'s temper,\\nbefore we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.\\nHe may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.\"\\n\\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,\\nand that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour\\nand resolution.  It is Frank Churchill\\'s duty to pay this attention\\nto his father.  He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages;\\nbut if he wished to do it, it might be done.  A man who felt rightly\\nwould say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--\\n`Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make\\nto your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately.\\nI know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him\\non the present occasion.  I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.\\'--\\nIf he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming\\na man, there would be no opposition made to his going.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again.  Such language for a young man entirely dependent,\\nto use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible.\\nBut you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly\\nopposite to your own.  Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such\\na speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,\\nand are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,\\nI suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine\\nsuch conduct practicable?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,\\nof course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--\\nwould do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger\\nwith the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts\\nand expedients can ever do.  Respect would be added to affection.\\nThey would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had\\ndone rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,\\nas well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he\\nought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting\\ntheir power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better\\nof him for submitting to their whims.  Respect for right conduct\\nis felt by every body.  If he would act in this sort of manner,\\non principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend\\nto his.\"\\n\\n\"I rather doubt that.  You are very fond of bending little minds;\\nbut where little minds belong to rich people in authority,\\nI think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as\\nunmanageable as great ones.  I can imagine, that if you, as you are,\\nMr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in\\nMr. Frank Churchill\\'s situation, you would be able to say and do\\njust what you have been recommending for him; and it might have\\na very good effect.  The Churchills might not have a word to say\\nin return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience\\nand long observance to break through.  To him who has, it might\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,\\nand set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.\\nHe may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,\\nwithout being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up\\nto it.\"\\n\\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense.  If it failed to produce\\nequal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit!  I wish you would try\\nto understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel\\nin directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been\\nlooking up to all his life.\"\\n\\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against\\nthe will of others.  It ought to have been a habit with him by\\nthis time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.\\nI can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.\\nAs he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off\\nall that was unworthy in their authority.  He ought to have opposed\\nthe first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.\\nHad he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is\\nnothing extraordinary.  I have not the least idea of his being\\na weak young man:  I feel sure that he is not.  Mr. Weston would\\nnot be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely\\nto have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit\\nyour notions of man\\'s perfection.  I dare say he has; and though\\nit may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,\\nand of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself\\nextremely expert in finding excuses for it.  He can sit down and\\nwrite a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,\\nand persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method\\nin the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father\\'s\\nhaving any right to complain.  His letters disgust me.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings are singular.  They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.  They hardly can\\nsatisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:  standing in\\na mother\\'s place, but without a mother\\'s affection to blind her.\\nIt is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,\\nand she must doubly feel the omission.  Had she been a person\\nof consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would\\nnot have signified whether he did or no.  Can you think your friend\\nbehindhand in these sort of considerations?  Do you suppose she\\ndoes not often say all this to herself?  No, Emma, your amiable\\nyoung man can be amiable only in French, not in English.  He may be\\nvery `aimable,\\' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he\\ncan have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:\\nnothing really amiable about him.\"\\n\\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do\\nnot want to think ill of him.  I should be as ready to acknowledge\\nhis merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are\\nmerely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\\nplausible manners.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a\\ntreasure at Highbury.  We do not often look upon fine young men,\\nwell-bred and agreeable.  We must not be nice and ask for all\\nthe virtues into the bargain.  Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,\\nwhat a _sensation_ his coming will produce?  There will be but one subject\\nthroughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--\\none object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;\\nwe shall think and speak of nobody else.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only\\na chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste\\nof every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being\\nuniversally agreeable.  To you, he will talk of farming; to me,\\nof drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general\\ninformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,\\nor take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak\\nextremely well on each; that is my idea of him.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!\\nWhat! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--\\nthe practised politician, who is to read every body\\'s character,\\nand make every body\\'s talents conduce to the display of his\\nown superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he\\nmay make all appear like fools compared with himself!  My dear Emma,\\nyour own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came\\nto the point.\"\\n\\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every\\nthing to evil.  We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him;\\nand we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.\"\\n\\n\"Prejudiced!  I am not prejudiced.\"\\n\\n\"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it.\\nMy love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in\\nhis favour.\"\\n\\n\"He is a person I never think of from one month\\'s end to another,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma\\nimmediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend\\nwhy he should be angry.\\n\\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be\\nof a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real\\nliberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;\\nfor with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid\\nto his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could\\nmake him unjust to the merit of another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME II\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,\\nin Emma\\'s opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.\\nShe could not think that Harriet\\'s solace or her own sins required more;\\nand she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject\\nas they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she\\nhad succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must\\nsuffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\\n\"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!\" she found something else must be done.\\n\\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.\\nThere was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered\\nby the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,\\nas rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she\\nought to the stock of their scanty comforts.\\n\\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\\nas to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--\\nand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate\\nand third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,\\nand therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden\\nresolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,\\nas she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,\\nthey were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\\n\\nThe house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\\nwhich was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially\\nand even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her\\nknitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up\\nher place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,\\nalmost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for\\ntheir visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s health, cheerful communications about her mother\\'s,\\nand sweet-cake from the beaufet--\"Mrs. Cole had just been there,\\njust called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an\\nhour with them, and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind\\nas to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\"\\n\\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from\\nMr. Elton since his going away.  Emma knew what was coming; they must\\nhave the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,\\nand how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he\\nwas wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies\\'\\nball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the\\ninterest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always\\nputting forward to prevent Harriet\\'s being obliged to say a word.\\n\\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house;\\nbut meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther\\nincommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst\\nall the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.\\nShe had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;\\nbut he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away\\nfrom him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from\\nher niece.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--\\nMrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--\\nMrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;\\nfor as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,\\nJane is so very great a favourite there.  Whenever she is with us,\\nMrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;\\nand I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.\\nAnd so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you\\ncannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\\nfor writing;\\' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,\\nwe had a letter this very morning,\\' I do not know that I ever saw\\nany body more surprized.  `Have you, upon your honour?\\' said she;\\n`well, that is quite unexpected.  Do let me hear what she says.\\'\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\\n\\n\"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?  I am extremely happy.\\nI hope she is well?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  You are so kind!\" replied the happily deceived aunt,\\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is.  I was sure\\nit could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,\\nwithout being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand\\nso very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.\\nI was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was\\nreading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--\\na letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;\\nso I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under\\nmy huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what\\nshe says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,\\napologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--\\nhardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.\\nMy mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,\\nnow I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work\\'--\\ndon\\'t you, ma\\'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive\\nto make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--\\nevery word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had\\nmade out every word.  And, indeed, though my mother\\'s eyes are not\\nso good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!\\nwith the help of spectacles.  It is such a blessing!  My mother\\'s\\nare really very good indeed.  Jane often says, when she is here,\\n`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see\\nas you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish\\nmy eyes may last me as well.\\'\"\\n\\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\nFairfax\\'s handwriting.\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;\\n\"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.\\nI am sure there is nobody\\'s praise that could give us so much pleasure\\nas Miss Woodhouse\\'s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf\\nyou know.  Ma\\'am,\" addressing her, \"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse\\nis so obliging to say about Jane\\'s handwriting?\"\\n\\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\\nrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.\\nShe was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming\\nvery rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax\\'s letter, and had\\nalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,\\nwhen Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.\\n\\n\"My mother\\'s deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.\\nBy only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.  But it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\nJane speaks so distinct!  However, she will not find her grandmama\\nat all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great\\ndeal at my mother\\'s time of life--and it really is full two years,\\nyou know, since she was here.  We never were so long without seeing\\nher before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know\\nhow to make enough of her now.\"\\n\\n\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; next week.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  You are very kind.  Yes, next week.  Every body is\\nso surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.  I am\\nsure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they\\ncan be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,\\nbecause Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one\\nof those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!\\nBut they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.\\nThat is what she writes about.  That is the reason of her writing out\\nof rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have\\nheard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, so I imagined.  I was afraid there could be little chance\\nof my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\"\\n\\n\"So obliging of you!  No, we should not have heard, if it had not\\nbeen for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here\\nso soon.  My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months\\nwith us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I\\nam going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is,\\nyou see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.  Mrs. Dixon has\\npersuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.\\nThey had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so\\nimpatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,\\nshe was never away from them so much as a week, which must make\\nit very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\\nbut however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\nto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,\\nbut we shall see presently in Jane\\'s letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon\\'s\\nname as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\\nand they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back\\nto their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.\\nJane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--\\nI do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;\\nbut it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak\\nof his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used\\nto be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell\\nwere very particular about their daughter\\'s not walking out\\noften with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;\\nof course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell\\nabout his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he\\nhad taken himself.  He is a most amiable, charming young man,\\nI believe.  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account\\nof things.\"\\n\\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering\\nEmma\\'s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,\\nand the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design\\nof farther discovery,\\n\\n\"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed\\nto come to you at such a time.  Considering the very particular\\nfriendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected\\nher to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true, indeed.  The very thing that we have always\\nbeen rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her\\nat such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come\\nif any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out\\nfor the best.  They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to\\ncome over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;\\nnothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation,\\nJane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the\\nleast backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.\\nEver since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were\\nout in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling\\nround of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed\\ninto the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,\\nwith the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\\n(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we\\nhad the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\"\\n\\n\"But, in spite of all her friends\\' urgency, and her own wish\\nof seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you\\nand Mrs. Bates?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they\\nshould recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try\\nher native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\"\\n\\n\"I am concerned to hear of it.  I think they judge wisely.\\nBut Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.  Mrs. Dixon,\\nI understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,\\nby any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\\nThere is no comparison between them.  Miss Campbell always was\\nabsolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that of course.\"\\n\\n\"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th\\nof November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been\\nwell since.  A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?\\nShe never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.\\nJust like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,\\nthat her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,\\nand try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt\\nthat three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--\\nand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here,\\nthan go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we\\nshould do.\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\"\\n\\n\"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the\\nCampbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--\\nas you will find from Jane\\'s letter.  So sudden!--You may guess,\\ndear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!\\nIf it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid\\nwe must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly.\\nI must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.\\nI always make a point of reading Jane\\'s letters through to myself first,\\nbefore I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there\\nbeing any thing in them to distress her.  Jane desired me to do it,\\nso I always do:  and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\\nburst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!\\'--\\nwhich my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly\\nalarmed at.  However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad\\nas I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her,\\nthat she does not think much about it.  But I cannot imagine\\nhow I could be so off my guard.  If Jane does not get well soon,\\nwe will call in Mr. Perry.  The expense shall not be thought of;\\nand though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say\\nhe would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not\\nsuffer it to be so, you know.  He has a wife and family to maintain,\\nand is not to be giving away his time.  Well, now I have just given you\\na hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am\\nsure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it\\nfor her.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\\nand beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us.\\nI had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than\\nfive minutes, when I first entered the house.  I merely called,\\nbecause I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates;\\nbut I have been so pleasantly detained!  Now, however, we must wish\\nyou and Mrs. Bates good morning.\"\\n\\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.\\nShe regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been\\nforced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard\\nthe whole substance of Jane Fairfax\\'s letter, she had been able\\nto escape the letter itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates\\'s\\nyoungest daughter.\\n\\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,\\nand Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,\\nhope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking\\nunder consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\\n\\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old,\\non losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,\\nthe consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;\\nof her being taught only what very limited means could command,\\nand growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,\\nto be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,\\ngood understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\\n\\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave\\na change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had\\nvery highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most\\ndeserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for\\nsuch attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved\\nhis life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,\\nthough some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,\\nbefore his own return to England put any thing in his power.\\nWhen he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.\\nHe was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,\\nabout Jane\\'s age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits\\nand growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,\\nhis daughter\\'s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being\\na real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell\\nof undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted;\\nand from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell\\'s family,\\nand had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother\\nfrom time to time.\\n\\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;\\nthe very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father\\nmaking independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise\\nwas out of Colonel Campbell\\'s power; for though his income, by pay\\nand appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must\\nbe all his daughter\\'s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped\\nto be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\\n\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax\\'s history.  She had fallen into good hands,\\nknown nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given\\nan excellent education.  Living constantly with right-minded\\nand well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received\\nevery advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell\\'s\\nresidence being in London, every lighter talent had been done\\nfull justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.\\nHer disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that\\nfriendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far\\nas such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she\\nwas too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor mother\\ncould promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil day\\nwas put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all\\nthe rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious\\nmixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,\\nthe sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind\\nher that all this might soon be over.\\n\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party\\nfrom the circumstance of Jane\\'s decided superiority both in beauty\\nand acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not\\nbe unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind\\nbe unfelt by the parents.  They continued together with unabated\\nregard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,\\nthat luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,\\ngiving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,\\nengaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,\\nalmost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly\\nand happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\\n\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\\nhad fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\nshould be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,\\nshe had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,\\nand retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,\\nequal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\\n\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived,\\nno exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;\\nand for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;\\nbut this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better\\nbe soon.  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\\nand wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared\\nher from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\\nnow be relinquished.  Still, however, affection was glad to catch\\nat any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.\\nShe had never been quite well since the time of their daughter\\'s marriage;\\nand till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,\\nthey must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being\\ncompatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,\\nunder the most favourable circumstances, to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort.\\n\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account\\nto her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some\\ntruths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their\\nabsence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect\\nliberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:\\nand the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,\\nwhether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement\\ntheir ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few\\nmonths spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,\\nthan on any thing else.  Certain it was that she was to come;\\nand that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for\\nthe present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness\\nof a two years\\' absence.\\n\\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did\\nnot like through three long months!--to be always doing more than\\nshe wished, and less than she ought!  Why she did not like Jane\\nFairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley\\nhad once told her it was because she saw in her the really\\naccomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;\\nand though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,\\nthere were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could\\nnot quite acquit her.  But \"she could never get acquainted with her:\\nshe did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--\\nsuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,\\nher aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss\\nwith by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were\\nto be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had\\nsupposed they must be so fond of each other.\"  These were her reasons--\\nshe had no better.\\n\\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;\\nand now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years\\'\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\nand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had\\nherself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty,\\njust such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could\\nthink very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most\\nbecoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance\\nof ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.\\nEmma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--\\nthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;\\nit was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes,\\na deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied\\ntheir praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,\\nas wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\\nno fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance\\nwas the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,\\nby all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person\\nor of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,\\nwas distinction, and merit.\\n\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\\nwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\\nof rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\\nher no longer.  When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,\\nas well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance\\nwas destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going\\nto live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\\nand respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling\\nher to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance\\nof an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started\\nto herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable\\nor more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nMr. Dixon\\'s actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous\\nwhich her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love,\\nit might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.\\nShe might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,\\nwhile a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,\\nthe purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit\\nto Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from\\nhim and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.\\n\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.\\n\\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\nJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\\nand errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome;\\nshe is better than handsome!\"  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield\\nwith her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much\\ninto its usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt\\nwas as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her\\nhealth was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to\\nlisten to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\\nshe ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,\\nas well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\\nmother and herself; and Jane\\'s offences rose again.  They had music;\\nEmma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily\\nfollowed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air\\nof greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance.  She was, besides, which was the worst of all,\\nso cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.\\nWrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined\\nto hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\\n\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more\\nreserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.\\nShe seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon\\'s character,\\nor her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness\\nof the match.  It was all general approbation and smoothness;\\nnothing delineated or distinguished.  It did her no service however.\\nHer caution was thrown away.  Emma saw its artifice, and returned\\nto her first surmises.  There probably _was_ something more to conceal\\nthan her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near\\nchanging one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,\\nfor the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\\n\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics.  She and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that they were\\na little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was.  \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\"  \"Was he agreeable?\"--\\n\"He was generally thought so.\"  \"Did he appear a sensible young man;\\na young man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common\\nLondon acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.\\nManners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer\\nknowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.  She believed\\nevery body found his manners pleasing.\"  Emma could not forgive her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,\\nhe was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on\\nbusiness with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so\\nopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,\\nbut speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.\\nHe had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great\\npleasure in marking an improvement.\\n\\n\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse\\nhad been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,\\nand the papers swept away;--\"particularly pleasant.  You and Miss\\nFairfax gave us some very good music.  I do not know a more\\nluxurious state, sir, than sitting at one\\'s ease to be entertained\\na whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music\\nand sometimes with conversation.  I am sure Miss Fairfax must\\nhave found the evening pleasant, Emma.  You left nothing undone.\\nI was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\\nat her grandmother\\'s, it must have been a real indulgence.\"\\n\\n\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am\\nnot often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you\\nare not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.\\nIf any thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it\\nhad been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not\\noften deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.\\nI think you understand me, therefore.\"\\n\\nAn arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she\\nsaid only, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved.\"\\n\\n\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome\\nall that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that\\nhas its foundation in diffidence.  What arises from discretion\\nmust be honoured.\"\\n\\n\"You think her diffident.  I do not see it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he, moving from his chair into one close\\nby her, \"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you\\nhad not a pleasant evening.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\\nand amused to think how little information I obtained.\"\\n\\n\"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer.\\n\\n\"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nin his quiet way.  \"I had.  Once, I felt the fire rather too much;\\nbut then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did\\nnot disturb me.  Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,\\nas she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.  However,\\nshe is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.\\nI like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of\\nyoung lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.\\nShe must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she\\nhad Emma.\"\\n\\n\"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for\\nthe present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\\n\\n\"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one\\'s eyes from.\\nI am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared\\nto express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwhose thoughts were on the Bates\\'s, said--\\n\\n\"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!\\na great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one\\ncan venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--\\nNow we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them\\na loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is\\nnot like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,\\nunless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,\\nas ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,\\nfor no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--\\ndo not you think so, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,\\nbut that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,\\nif it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,\\njust as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a\\nboiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider\\nit unwholesome.\"\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you.\\nYou like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think\\nwill interest you.\"\\n\\n\"News!  Oh! yes, I always like news.  What is it?--why do you\\nsmile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\"\\n\\nHe had time only to say,\\n\\n\"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\" when the door\\nwas thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.\\nFull of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to\\ngive quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,\\nand that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse--\\nI come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!\\nYou are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going\\nto be married.\"\\n\\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was\\nso completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,\\nand a little blush, at the sound.\\n\\n\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction\\nof some part of what had passed between them.\\n\\n\"But where could _you_ hear it?\" cried Miss Bates.  \"Where could\\nyou possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?  For it is not five minutes\\nsince I received Mrs. Cole\\'s note--no, it cannot be more than five--\\nor at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready\\nto come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about\\nthe pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--\\nfor my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan\\nlarge enough.  So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,\\n`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,\\nand Patty has been washing the kitchen.\\'--`Oh! my dear,\\'\\nsaid I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--\\nthat\\'s all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley,\\nhow could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole\\ntold Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.  A Miss Hawkins--\"\\n\\n\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.\\nHe had just read Elton\\'s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it\\nto me directly.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.\\nMy mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a\\nthousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\"\\n\\n\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it\\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\\ncannot have a greater pleasure than--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\\nto us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\\nWe may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.\\'\\nWell, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\"\\n\\n\"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\"--\\nHere was a sly glance at Emma.  \"He had been so fortunate as to--\\nI forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.\\nThe information was, as you state, that he was going to be married\\nto a Miss Hawkins.  By his style, I should imagine it just settled.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\\n\"He will have every body\\'s wishes for his happiness.\"\\n\\n\"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse\\'s observation.\\n\"He had better not be in a hurry.  He seemed to me very well off\\nas he was.  We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\" said Miss Bates,\\njoyfully; \"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot\\nbear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.\\nThis is great news, indeed.  Jane, you have never seen\\nMr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly\\nto occupy her.\\n\\n\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this appeal;\\n\"is he--is he a tall man?\"\\n\\n\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma.  \"My father would\\nsay `yes,\\' Mr. Knightley `no;\\' and Miss Bates and I that he is\\njust the happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer,\\nMiss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard\\nof perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.  He is the very best\\nyoung man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday\\nhe was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.  Miss Hawkins,--I dare say,\\nan excellent young woman.  His extreme attention to my mother--\\nwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,\\nfor my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she\\ndoes not hear quite quick.  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a\\nlittle deaf.  He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--\\nbut she says it did him no lasting benefit.  Colonel Campbell,\\nyou know, is quite our angel.  And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming\\nyoung man, quite worthy of him.  It is such a happiness when good\\npeople get together--and they always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton\\nand Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;\\nand the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple\\nthan Mr. and Mrs. Perry.  I say, sir,\" turning to Mr. Woodhouse,\\n\"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\nI always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,\\nif there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--\\na roast loin of pork--\"\\n\\n\"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been\\nacquainted with her,\" said Emma, \"nothing I suppose can be known.\\nOne feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.  He has been\\ngone only four weeks.\"\\n\\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n\"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take\\nan interest in this news.  You, who have been hearing and seeing\\nso much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep\\nin the business on Miss Campbell\\'s account--we shall not excuse\\nyour being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.\"\\n\\n\"When I have seen Mr. Elton,\" replied Jane, \"I dare say I\\nshall be interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me.\\nAnd as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression\\nmay be a little worn off.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nsaid Miss Bates, \"four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;\\nnot that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,\\n`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but\\'--In short, I do\\nnot think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.\\nI do not pretend to it.  What is before me, I see.  At the same time,\\nnobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse\\nlets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\\noffend for the world.  How does Miss Smith do?  She seems quite\\nrecovered now.  Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?\\nOh! those dear little children.  Jane, do you know I always fancy\\nMr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.  I mean in person--tall, and with\\nthat sort of look--and not very talkative.\"\\n\\n\"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say,\\nis not, strictly speaking, handsome?\"\\n\\n\"Handsome!  Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.  I told you he\\nwas plain.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\\nand that you yourself--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard,\\nI always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed\\nthe general opinion, when I called him plain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.\\nThe weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.\\nYou are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must\\ntake leave.  This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.\\nI shall just go round by Mrs. Cole\\'s; but I shall not stop three minutes:\\nand, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you\\nout in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.\\nThank you, we do indeed.  I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,\\nfor I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork:\\nwhen we dress the leg it will be another thing.  Good morning to you,\\nmy dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is\\nso very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to\\ngive her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning\\nto you.\"\\n\\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him\\nwhile he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--\\nand to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give\\nto her own view of the subject.  It was to herself an amusing\\nand a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton\\ncould not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:\\nHarriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving\\nthe first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly\\nfrom others.  It was now about the time that she was likely to call.\\nIf she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning\\nto rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\\ndetaining her at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\\n\\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly\\nburst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.\\nAs the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater\\nkindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly\\nthrough what she had to tell.  \"She had set out from Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nhalf an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been\\nafraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might\\nget to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;\\nbut then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman\\nwas making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step\\nin and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\\nand she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast\\nas she could, and took shelter at Ford\\'s.\"--Ford\\'s was the principal\\nwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher\\'s shop united;\\nthe shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so,\\nthere she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,\\nfull ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--\\nto be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford\\'s--\\nwho should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--\\nDear Miss Woodhouse! only think.  I thought I should have fainted.\\nI did not know what to do.  I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw\\nme directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.\\nI am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;\\nand I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\\nI am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away\\nyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere\\nin the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,\\nI fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going\\non with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.\\nI am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking\\nthat he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,\\nMiss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up\\nto me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\\nif I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used;\\nI could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be\\nvery friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;\\nbut I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember\\nshe said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost\\ntoo kind!  Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!\\nBy that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined\\nthat nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--\\nI found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as\\nif he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,\\nand I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,\\nyou know, one can\\'t tell how; and then I took courage, and said it\\ndid not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\\nthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,\\nif I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round\\nby Mr. Cole\\'s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated\\nby this rain.  Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!\\nSo I said, I was very much obliged to him:  you know I could\\nnot do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round\\nby the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,\\nor any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done\\nany thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort\\nof satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.\\nAnd Elizabeth, too.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make\\nme comfortable again.\"\\n\\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\\nher power.  She was obliged to stop and think.  She was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself.  The young man\\'s conduct, and his sister\\'s,\\nseemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.\\nAs Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture\\nof wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.\\nBut she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;\\nand what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?\\nIt was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry\\nto lose her--they must be all sorry.  Ambition, as well as love,\\nhad probably been mortified.  They might all have hoped to rise\\nby Harriet\\'s acquaintance:  and besides, what was the value of\\nHarriet\\'s description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--\\nwhat signified her praise?\\n\\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable,\\nby considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite\\nunworthy of being dwelt on,\\n\\n\"It might be distressing, for the moment,\" said she; \"but you seem\\nto have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--\\ncan never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need\\nnot think about it.\"\\n\\nHarriet said, \"very true,\" and she \"would not think about it;\"\\nbut still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;\\nand Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,\\nwas obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give\\nwith so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether\\nto rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state\\nof mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton\\'s importance\\nwith her!\\n\\nMr. Elton\\'s rights, however, gradually revived.  Though she did not\\nfeel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,\\nor an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their\\nfirst conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the\\nsensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,\\nas to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place\\nthe Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.\\n\\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.\\nIt had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining\\nany influence to alarm.  As Harriet now lived, the Martins could\\nnot get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted\\neither the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her\\nrefusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard\\'s;\\nand a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,\\nwith any necessity, or even any power of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in\\ninteresting situations, that a young person, who either marries\\nor dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.\\n\\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins\\'s name was first\\nmentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,\\ndiscovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;\\nto be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable:\\nand when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,\\nand circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more\\nfor him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose\\nmusic she principally played.\\n\\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man.  He had gone away rejected\\nand mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series\\nof what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing\\nthe right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very\\nwrong one.  He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged\\nto another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first,\\nas under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.\\nHe came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing\\nfor Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\\n\\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\\nof perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\\nsome dignity, as well as some convenience:  the story told well;\\nhe had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.\\nor thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--\\nthe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\\ndistinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole\\nof the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps\\nso quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green\\'s,\\nand the party at Mrs. Brown\\'s--smiles and blushes rising in importance--\\nwith consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady\\nhad been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,\\nto use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,\\nthat vanity and prudence were equally contented.\\n\\nHe had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,\\nand was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself\\nand his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be\\nlaughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing\\nall the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,\\nhe would have been more cautiously gallant.\\n\\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves\\nto please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;\\nand when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,\\nwhich a certain glance of Mrs. Cole\\'s did not seem to contradict,\\nthat when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\\n\\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her\\nthe impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique\\nand pretension, now spread over his air.  She was, in fact,\\nbeginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing\\nat all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\\ndisagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,\\na lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,\\nshe would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.\\nShe wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare\\ntwenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.\\n\\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly\\nbe lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--\\nmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for\\nany change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.\\nIt would be almost beginning their life of civility again.\\n\\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.  She was good\\nenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--\\nhandsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet\\'s side.\\nAs to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,\\nthat after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,\\nhe had done nothing.  On that article, truth seemed attainable.\\n_What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out;\\nand setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at\\nall Harriet\\'s superior.  She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.\\nMiss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--\\nmerchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the\\nprofits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was\\nnot unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\nmoderate also.  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\\nbut Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though\\nthe father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--\\nin the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded\\nof him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter\\nhad lived.  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,\\nand too stupid to rise.  And all the grandeur of the connexion\\nseemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_,\\nto a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!\\nThat was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of\\nMiss Hawkins.\\n\\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!\\nShe had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be\\ntalked out of it.  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies\\nof Harriet\\'s mind was not to be talked away.  He might be superseded\\nby another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;\\neven a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,\\nshe feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,\\nhaving once begun, would be always in love.  And now, poor girl!\\nshe was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.\\nShe was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.  Emma saw\\nhim only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure\\n_just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him, _just_ to hear his voice,\\nor see his shoulder, _just_ to have something occur to preserve him\\nin her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.\\nShe was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when\\nat Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,\\nand found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;\\nand every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already\\noccurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,\\ncomprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually\\nin agitation around her.  Her regard was receiving strength by\\ninvariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings\\nirritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins\\'s happiness,\\nand continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--\\nhis air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,\\nbeing all in proof of how much he was in love!\\n\\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain\\nto her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of\\nHarriet\\'s mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.\\nSometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each\\nwas occasionally useful as a check to the other.  Mr. Elton\\'s\\nengagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.\\nThe unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been\\na little put aside by Elizabeth Martin\\'s calling at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\na few days afterwards.  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had\\nbeen prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;\\na small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;\\nand till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied\\nby it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess.  But Mr. Elton,\\nin person, had driven away all such cares.  While he staid,\\nthe Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off\\nfor Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\\njudged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin\\'s visit.\\n\\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--\\nand what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful\\nconsideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,\\nwhen invited to come, would be ingratitude.  It must not be:\\nand yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--\\n\\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet\\'s\\nreturning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,\\nshould convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.\\nShe meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,\\nwhile she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,\\nas to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what\\ndegree of intimacy was chosen for the future.\\n\\nShe could think of nothing better:  and though there was something\\nin it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,\\nmerely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting.  Only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, her evil stars had led\\nher to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to\\n_The_ _Rev._ _Philip_ _Elton_, _White-Hart_, _Bath_, was to be seen under the\\noperation of being lifted into the butcher\\'s cart, which was to\\nconvey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,\\nexcepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.\\n\\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to\\nbe put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led\\nbetween espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every\\nthing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,\\nwas beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,\\nEmma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,\\nwhich determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed\\nquarter of an hour.  She went on herself, to give that portion\\nof time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\\n\\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,\\nand unattended by any alarming young man.  She came solitarily\\ndown the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,\\nand parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\\n\\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.\\nShe was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her\\nenough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it\\nwas creating.  She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.\\nThey had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing\\nbeyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--\\ntill just at last, when Mrs. Martin\\'s saying, all of a sudden,\\nthat she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more\\ninteresting subject, and a warmer manner.  In that very room\\nshe had been measured last September, with her two friends.\\nThere were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\\nthe window.  _He_ had done it.  They all seemed to remember the day,\\nthe hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,\\nthe same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;\\nand they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma\\nmust suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)\\nwhen the carriage reappeared, and all was over.  The style of\\nthe visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.\\nFourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully\\npassed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture\\nit all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally\\nHarriet must suffer.  It was a bad business.  She would have given\\na great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins\\nin a higher rank of life.  They were so deserving, that a _little_\\nhigher should have been enough:  but as it was, how could she have\\ndone otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.  They must\\nbe separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--\\nso much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity\\nof a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls\\nto procure it.  Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.\\nThe refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard\\nthat neither \"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both\\nbeen out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\\n\\n\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away.  \"And now we\\nshall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been\\nso disappointed.\"  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge\\nher murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--\\nsuch being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.\\nPresently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt\\nby Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.\\nThere was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater\\npleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted\\nher with,\\n\\n\"How d\\'ye do?--how d\\'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--\\nglad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter\\nthis morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--\\nhe is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would\\nbe so.  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days;\\nI was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going\\nto have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.\\nWe shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly\\nas we could wish.\"\\n\\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston\\'s, confirmed as it all\\nwas by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,\\nbut not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming\\ncertain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did\\nshe rejoice in their joy.  It was a most delightful reanimation\\nof exhausted spirits.  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness\\nof what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment\\'s thought,\\nshe hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.\\n\\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,\\nwhich allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at\\nhis command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;\\nand she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.\\n\\n\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.\\n\\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,\\nfrom his wife.\\n\\n\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining\\nthe girls.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must\\nnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"--\\nthough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\\ndifferent conviction.\\n\\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer\\nin a manner that appropriated nothing.\\n\\n\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o\\'clock,\"\\nwas Mrs. Weston\\'s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,\\nand meant only for her.\\n\\n\"Four o\\'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr. Weston\\'s\\nquick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\nEmma\\'s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\\na different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish\\nas before.  When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at\\nleast must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,\\nshe saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\\n\\n\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"--\\nwas a question, however, which did not augur much.\\n\\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,\\nand Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come\\nin time.\\n\\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve\\no\\'clock, that she was to think of her at four.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy,\\nwhile walking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful\\nfor every body\\'s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your\\nlittle fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure\\nthat all is right.\"  The clock struck twelve as she passed through\\nthe hall.  \"\\'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four\\nhours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,\\nI may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.\\nI am sure they will bring him soon.\"\\n\\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with\\nher father--Mr. Weston and his son.  They had been arrived only\\na few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation\\nof Frank\\'s being a day before his time, and her father was yet\\nin the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when\\nshe appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\\n\\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,\\nwas actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did\\nnot think too much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good\\nlooking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,\\nand his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness\\nof his father\\'s; he looked quick and sensible.  She felt immediately\\nthat she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,\\nand a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending\\nto be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\\n\\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before.  She was pleased\\nwith the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,\\nand travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half\\na day.\\n\\n\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named.  I remembered\\nwhat I used to do myself.  One cannot creep upon a journey;\\none cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the\\npleasure of coming in upon one\\'s friends before the look-out begins,\\nis worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.\"\\n\\n\"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\" said the young man,\\n\"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\"\\n\\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;\\nthe conviction was strengthened by what followed.  He was very much\\npleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,\\nwould hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,\\nthe walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\\nin the country which none but one\\'s _own_ country gives, and the\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it.  That he should never have been\\nable to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously\\nthrough Emma\\'s brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a\\npleasant one, and pleasantly handled.  His manner had no air of study\\nor exaggeration.  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no\\ncommon enjoyment.\\n\\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.\\nOn his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--\\nPleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,\\nafforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses\\nin and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?\"\\n\\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,\\nwhile their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing\\nhis mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,\\nso much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she\\nsecured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,\\nas was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--\\nand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.\\nHe did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\\nthoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know\\nvery little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;\\nhe could be sure of little else.  \"His father\\'s marriage,\" he said,\\n\"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;\\nand the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\\nbe ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation\\non him.\"\\n\\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor\\'s merits,\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse\\'s\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor\\'s. And at last, as if resolved\\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he\\nwound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.\\n\\n\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he;\\n\"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected\\nmore than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;\\nI did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"\\nsaid Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\\nwith pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\\nsuch words.  Don\\'t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as\\na pretty young woman.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it,\\n(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should\\nunderstand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought\\nextravagant in my terms.\"\\n\\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\\nfrom their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession\\nof her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were\\nto be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.\\nShe must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she\\nonly felt they were agreeable.\\n\\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.\\nHis quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them\\nwith a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not\\nto look, she was confident that he was often listening.\\n\\nHer own father\\'s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,\\nthe entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration\\nor suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.  Happily he\\nwas not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--\\nThough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,\\nhe never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;\\nit seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons\\'\\nunderstanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were\\nproved against them.  She blessed the favouring blindness.\\nHe could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,\\nwithout a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,\\ngive way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous\\ninquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s accommodation on his journey,\\nthrough the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express\\nvery genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped\\ncatching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite\\nassured of himself till after another night.\\n\\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going.\\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\\nfor Mrs. Weston at Ford\\'s, but he need not hurry any body else.\"\\nHis son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the\\nopportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,\\nand therefore may as well be paid now.  I have the honour of being\\nacquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady\\nresiding in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.\\nI shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;\\nthough Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather\\nsay Barnes, or Bates.  Do you know any family of that name?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--\\nI saw Miss Bates at the window.  True, true, you are acquainted\\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine\\ngirl she is.  Call upon her, by all means.\"\\n\\n\"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\" said the\\nyoung man; \"another day would do as well; but there was that degree\\nof acquaintance at Weymouth which--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.  What is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon.  And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.\\nYou saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body\\nshe mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,\\nwho has barely enough to live on.  If you do not call early it\\nwill be a slight.\"\\n\\nThe son looked convinced.\\n\\n\"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\" said Emma; \"she is\\na very elegant young woman.\"\\n\\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost\\nto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct\\nsort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could\\nbe thought only ordinarily gifted with it.\\n\\n\"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\"\\nsaid she, \"I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;\\nsee her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,\\nfor she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.\"\\n\\n\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\"\\nsaid Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;\\n\"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\\nagreeable young lady.  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama\\nand aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.\\nThey will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my\\nservants shall go with you to shew you the way.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\"\\n\\n\"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;\\nyou might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you\\nwhere you had best cross the street.\"\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good friend,\\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he\\nsees it, and as to Mrs. Bates\\'s, he may get there from the Crown\\nin a hop, step, and jump.\"\\n\\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,\\nand a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.\\nEmma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,\\nand could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of\\nthe day, with full confidence in their comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.  He came with\\nMrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.\\nHe had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\\ntill her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse\\ntheir walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there\\nbeing very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,\\nhe should always chuse the same.  Highbury, that airy, cheerful,\\nhappy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.\"--\\nHighbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to\\nits bearing the same construction with him.  They walked thither directly.\\n\\nEmma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in\\nfor half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,\\nknew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize\\nto her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,\\narm in arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially\\nto see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom\\nher opinion of him was to depend.  If he were deficient there,\\nnothing should make amends for it.  But on seeing them together,\\nshe became perfectly satisfied.  It was not merely in fine words\\nor hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be\\nmore proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could\\nmore agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and\\nsecuring her affection.  And there was time enough for Emma to form a\\nreasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.\\nThey were all three walking about together for an hour or two--\\nfirst round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.\\nHe was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently\\nfor Mr. Woodhouse\\'s ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,\\nconfessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,\\nand found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma\\ncould have supposed.\\n\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.\\nHe begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,\\nand which had been the home of his father\\'s father; and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though\\nin some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,\\nthey shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,\\nwhich must be very like a merit to those he was with.\\n\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,\\nit could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making\\na parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly\\nhad not done him justice.\\n\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,\\nthough the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of\\npost-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood\\nthan from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected\\nto be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they\\ngave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built\\nmany years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been\\nin a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used\\nas such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the\\nhighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist\\nclub established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.\\nHe was immediately interested.  Its character as a ball-room caught him;\\nand instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two\\nsuperior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate\\nits capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should\\nhave ceased.  He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge\\nnone which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,\\nhandsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort.\\nThey ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through\\nthe winter.  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good\\nold days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!\\nThe want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\\ntempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.\\nHe could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw\\naround him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;\\nand even when particulars were given and families described, he was\\nstill unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture\\nwould be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty\\nin every body\\'s returning into their proper place the next morning.\\nHe argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma\\nwas rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail\\nso decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have\\nall the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations\\nof his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.\\nOf pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference\\nto a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.\\nHe could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\\nIt was but an effusion of lively spirits.\\n\\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\\nand being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,\\nEmma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him\\nif he had paid it.\\n\\n\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it.\\nA very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very\\nmuch obliged to you for your preparatory hint.  If the talking aunt\\nhad taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.\\nAs it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.\\nTen minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that\\nwas proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home\\nbefore him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my\\nutter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)\\njoined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them\\nvery nearly three-quarters of an hour.  The good lady had not given me\\nthe possibility of escape before.\"\\n\\n\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"\\n\\n\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill.\\nBut the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\\nLadies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally\\nso pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--\\nA most deplorable want of complexion.\"\\n\\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\\nFairfax\\'s complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she\\nwould not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was\\na softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\\nto the character of her face.\"  He listened with all due deference;\\nacknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he\\nmust confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want\\nof the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,\\na fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,\\nthe effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the\\neffect was.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least\\nyou admire her except her complexion.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax\\nand her complexion.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her often at Weymouth?  Were you often in the same society?\"\\n\\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford\\'s, and he hastily exclaimed,\\n\"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\\nof their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself,\\nhe says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford\\'s.\\nIf it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.\\nI must buy something at Ford\\'s. It will be taking out my freedom.--\\nI dare say they sell gloves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.  I do admire your patriotism.\\nYou will be adored in Highbury.  You were very popular before you came,\\nbecause you were Mr. Weston\\'s son--but lay out half a guinea at\\nFord\\'s, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.\"\\n\\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \"Men\\'s Beavers\"\\nand \"York Tan\" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,\\nhe said--\"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking\\nto me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\\nof my _amor_ _patriae_.  Do not let me lose it.  I assure you the utmost\\nstretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\\nhappiness in private life.\"\\n\\n\"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax\\nand her party at Weymouth.\"\\n\\n\"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one.  It is always the lady\\'s right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance.  Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--\\nI shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.\\nBut her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,\\nshe is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least\\ninformation about any body, that I really think you may say what you\\nlike of your acquaintance with her.\"\\n\\n\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me\\nso well.  I met her frequently at Weymouth.  I had known the Campbells\\na little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\\nwarm-hearted woman.  I like them all.\"\\n\\n\"You know Miss Fairfax\\'s situation in life, I conclude; what she\\nis destined to be?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\"\\n\\n\"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\" said Mrs. Weston smiling;\\n\"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows\\nwhat to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax\\'s situation in life.\\nI will move a little farther off.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\" said Emma, \"as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\"\\n\\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\\n\\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,\\n\"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill.\\n\\n\"Ever hear her!\" repeated Emma.  \"You forget how much she belongs\\nto Highbury.  I have heard her every year of our lives since we\\nboth began.  She plays charmingly.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\\ncould really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,\\nwith considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--\\nI am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill\\nor right of judging of any body\\'s performance.--I have been used\\nto hear her\\'s admired; and I remember one proof of her being\\nthought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love\\nwith another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--\\nwould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,\\nif the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed\\nto like to hear one if he could hear the other.  That, I thought,\\nin a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\"\\n\\n\"Proof indeed!\" said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,\\nis he?  We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought\\nit a very strong proof.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal\\nstronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all\\nagreeable to me.  I could not excuse a man\\'s having more music\\nthan love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine\\nsounds than to my feelings.  How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\"\\n\\n\"It was her very particular friend, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Poor comfort!\" said Emma, laughing.  \"One would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than one\\'s very particular friend--with a stranger it might\\nnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--\\nPoor Mrs. Dixon!  Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\"\\n\\n\"You are right.  It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;\\nbut she really did not seem to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.\\nBut be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,\\nor dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have\\nfelt it:  Miss Fairfax herself.  She must have felt the improper\\nand dangerous distinction.\"\\n\\n\"As to that--I do not--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax\\'s\\nsensations from you, or from any body else.  They are known to no\\nhuman being, I guess, but herself.  But if she continued to play\\nwhenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\"\\n\\n\"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\"\\nhe began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \"however, it\\nis impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--\\nhow it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there\\nwas smoothness outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from\\na child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she\\nis likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.\"\\n\\n\"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\\nand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should\\nbe intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever\\nshe visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it\\nhas happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side\\nwhich was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized\\nand so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,\\nand all their set.  And then, her reserve--I never could attach\\nmyself to any one so completely reserved.\"\\n\\n\"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\" said he.  \"Oftentimes\\nvery convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.  There is safety\\nin reserve, but no attraction.  One cannot love a reserved person.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater.  But I must be more in want of a friend,\\nor an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take\\nthe trouble of conquering any body\\'s reserve to procure one.\\nIntimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.\\nI have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that\\nsuch extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,\\nsuch a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt\\nto suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.\"\\n\\nHe perfectly agreed with her:  and after walking together so long,\\nand thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.\\nHe was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the\\nworld in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,\\ntherefore better than she had expected.  His ideas seemed more moderate--\\nhis feelings warmer.  She was particularly struck by his manner\\nof considering Mr. Elton\\'s house, which, as well as the church,\\nhe would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much\\nfault with.  No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house\\nas a man was to be pitied for having.  If it were to be shared with\\nthe woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having\\nthat house.  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.\\nThe man must be a blockhead who wanted more.\\n\\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\\nUsed only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could\\nbe no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.\\nBut Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination\\nto settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.\\nHe might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\\noccasioned by no housekeeper\\'s room, or a bad butler\\'s pantry,\\nbut no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make\\nhim happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly\\ngive up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nEmma\\'s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken\\nthe following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,\\nmerely to have his hair cut.  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him\\nat breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\\nhaving his hair cut.  There was certainly no harm in his travelling\\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air\\nof foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.  It did\\nnot accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,\\nor even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself\\nto discern in him yesterday.  Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\\nliable to all these charges.  His father only called him a coxcomb,\\nand thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,\\nwas clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,\\nand making no other comment than that \"all young people would have\\ntheir little whims.\"\\n\\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.  Mrs. Weston\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he\\nmade himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.\\nHe appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful\\nand lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,\\na great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,\\nwas fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the\\nworld if he were left to himself; and though there was no being\\nattached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,\\nand seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.\\nThis was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy\\nfor having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy\\nof the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;\\nthe honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being\\nat least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--\\n(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,\\nof being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\\nhave some weight.  He gave her to understand that Frank admired\\nher extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;\\nand with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must\\nnot judge him harshly.  As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people\\nwould have their little whims.\"\\n\\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\\nleniently disposed.  In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\\nof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances\\nwere made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--\\none who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit\\namong them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows\\nor smiles--Mr. Knightley.  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;\\nfor the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately\\nafterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,\\n\"Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.\"  She had\\nhalf a mind to resent; but an instant\\'s observation convinced\\nher that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,\\nand not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\\n\\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston\\'s visit this morning was in another respect\\nparticularly opportune.  Something occurred while they were\\nat Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was\\nstill more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.\\n\\nThis was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years\\nin Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,\\nand unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,\\nin trade, and only moderately genteel.  On their first coming into\\nthe country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,\\nkeeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last\\nyear or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--\\nthe house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general\\nhad smiled on them.  With their wealth, their views increased;\\ntheir want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.\\nThey added to their house, to their number of servants,\\nto their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune\\nand style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\\nTheir love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\\nfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among\\nthe single men, had already taken place.  The regular and best\\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--\\nneither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.  Nothing should\\ntempt _her_ to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father\\'s\\nknown habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she\\ncould wish.  The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they\\nought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms\\non which the superior families would visit them.  This lesson,\\nshe very much feared, they would receive only from herself;\\nshe had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\\n\\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many\\nweeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,\\nit found her very differently affected.  Donwell and Randalls\\nhad received their invitation, and none had come for her father\\nand herself; and Mrs. Weston\\'s accounting for it with \"I suppose\\nthey will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not\\ndine out,\" was not quite sufficient.  She felt that she should\\nlike to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea\\nof the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those\\nwhose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,\\nshe did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.\\nHarriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.  They had\\nbeen speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\\nand Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.\\nMight not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.\\nThe bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;\\nand her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission\\nto be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\\n\\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were\\nat Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\\nfirst remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\"\\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\\n\\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\\nwithout inclination for the party.  The Coles expressed themselves\\nso properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--\\nso much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\\nhonour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen\\nfrom London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught\\nof air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\\nhonour of his company.\"  Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;\\nand it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\\ndone without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,\\nif not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--\\nMr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter\\'s\\ngoing out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending\\nthe whole evening away from him.  As for _his_ going, Emma did\\nnot wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,\\nand the party too numerous.  He was soon pretty well resigned.\\n\\n\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was.\\nNo more is Emma.  Late hours do not agree with us.  I am sorry\\nMr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.  I think it would be\\nmuch better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,\\nand take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;\\nwhich they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home\\nwithout being out in the damp of the evening.  The dews of a summer\\nevening are what I would not expose any body to.  However, as they\\nare so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you\\nwill both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,\\nI cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,\\nneither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\"  Then turning to Mrs. Weston,\\nwith a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah!  Miss Taylor, if you had\\nnot married, you would have staid at home with me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away,\\nit is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will\\nstep to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"\\n\\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\\nnot lessening, Mr. Woodhouse\\'s agitation.  The ladies knew better\\nhow to allay it.  Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing\\ndeliberately arranged.\\n\\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough\\nfor talking as usual.  \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.\\nHe had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,\\nand invite her.  James could take the note.  But first of all,\\nthere must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.  You will\\nsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\\ndecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_,\\nof course.  But you will do every thing right.  I need not tell you\\nwhat is to be done.  We must remember to let James know that the carriage\\nwill be wanted on Tuesday.  I shall have no fears for you with him.\\nWe have never been there above once since the new approach was made;\\nbut still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.\\nAnd when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would\\nhave him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.\\nYou will not like staying late.  You will get very tired when tea\\nis over.\"\\n\\n\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.  There will be\\na great many people talking at once.  You will not like the noise.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"if Emma comes away early,\\nit will be breaking up the party.\"\\n\\n\"And no great harm if it does,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"The sooner\\nevery party breaks up, the better.\"\\n\\n\"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.\\nEmma\\'s going away directly after tea might be giving offence.\\nThey are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;\\nbut still they must feel that any body\\'s hurrying away is no\\ngreat compliment; and Miss Woodhouse\\'s doing it would be more thought\\nof than any other person\\'s in the room.  You would not wish to disappoint\\nand mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people\\nas ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years.\"\\n\\n\"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged\\nto you for reminding me.  I should be extremely sorry to be giving\\nthem any pain.  I know what worthy people they are.  Perry tells\\nme that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.  You would not think\\nit to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.\\nNo, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.  My dear Emma,\\nwe must consider this.  I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting\\nMr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.\\nYou will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,\\nyou know, among your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, papa.  I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have\\nno scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.\\nI am only afraid of your sitting up for me.  I am not afraid\\nof your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.\\nShe loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid\\nyou will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your\\nusual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.\\nYou must promise me not to sit up.\"\\n\\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side:  such as that,\\nif she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;\\nif hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid\\nshould sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see\\nthat every thing were safe in the house, as usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father\\'s\\ndinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston\\nwas too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,\\nto betray any imperfection which could be concealed.\\n\\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with\\na very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed\\nof what he had done.  He had no reason to wish his hair longer,\\nto conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,\\nto improve his spirits.  He was quite as undaunted and as lively\\nas ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--\\n\\n\"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an\\nimpudent way.  Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not\\nalways folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.\\nMr. Knightley, he is _not_ a trifling, silly young man.  If he were,\\nhe would have done this differently.  He would either have gloried\\nin the achievement, or been ashamed of it.  There would have been\\neither the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too\\nweak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he\\nis not trifling or silly.\"\\n\\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,\\nand for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,\\nand by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;\\nof guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness\\ninto her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those\\nmight be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.\\n\\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at\\nMr. Cole\\'s; and without being able to forget that among the failings\\nof Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed\\nher more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\\n\\nHer father\\'s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as\\nMrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty,\\nbefore she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as\\nthey sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly\\nnoticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all\\nthe amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake\\nand full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his\\ncare of their constitution might have obliged them to practise\\nduring the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;\\nshe wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.\\n\\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole\\'s door; and was pleased\\nto see that it was Mr. Knightley\\'s; for Mr. Knightley keeping\\nno horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,\\nactivity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma\\'s opinion, to get\\nabout as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became\\nthe owner of Donwell Abbey.  She had an opportunity now of speaking\\nher approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\\n\\n\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--\\nI am quite glad to see you.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her, observing, \"How lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--\\nYou might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I should, I am sure I should.  There is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know\\nto be beneath them.  You think you carry it off very well, I dare say,\\nbut with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;\\nI always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.\\n_Now_ you have nothing to try for.  You are not afraid of being\\nsupposed ashamed.  You are not striving to look taller than any\\nbody else.  _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same\\nroom with you.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsensical girl!\" was his reply, but not at all in anger.\\n\\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party\\nas with Mr. Knightley.  She was received with a cordial respect\\nwhich could not but please, and given all the consequence she could\\nwish for.  When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,\\nthe strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;\\nthe son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\\nher as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated\\nby her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity\\non his side.\\n\\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox\\'s family,\\nthe lawyer of Highbury.  The less worthy females were to come\\nin the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;\\nbut already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject\\nof conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton\\nwere talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\\nthe pleasantness of her neighbour.  The first remote sound to which\\nshe felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.\\nMrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be\\nvery interesting.  She listened, and found it well worth listening to.\\nThat very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.\\nMrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,\\nand as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight\\nof a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,\\nbut a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,\\nthe end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,\\nand congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates\\'s, was,\\nthat this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood\\'s the day before,\\nto the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;\\nthat at first, by Miss Bates\\'s account, Jane herself was quite at\\na loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--\\nbut now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only\\none quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.\\n\\n\"One can suppose nothing else,\" added Mrs. Cole, \"and I was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt.  But Jane,\\nit seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said\\nabout it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their\\nsilence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.\\nThey might chuse to surprize her.\"\\n\\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there\\nwere enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,\\nand still listen to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\n\"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given\\nme more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,\\nwho plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.\\nIt seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses\\nthere are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.\\nThis is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was\\nbut yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed\\nto look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I\\ndo not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are\\nbut just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;\\nand there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest\\nold spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this\\nto Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he\\nis so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\\nhimself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might\\nbe so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;\\nand that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--\\nor else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great\\nhopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.\"\\n\\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole\\'s,\\nturned to Frank Churchill.\\n\\n\"Why do you smile?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Nay, why do you?\"\\n\\n\"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell\\'s being\\nso rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"I rather wonder that it was never made before.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\"\\n\\n\"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--\\nwhich must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\"\\n\\n\"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large\\nfor Mrs. Bates\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies\\nthat your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than I deserve.  I smile because you smile, and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\\nthere is to question.  If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?\"\\n\\n\"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.  I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.\\nShe must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument\\nwould be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,\\nis more like a young woman\\'s scheme than an elderly man\\'s. It\\nis Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.  I told you that your suspicions would\\nguide mine.\"\\n\\n\"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon\\nin them.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Dixon.--Very well.  Yes, I immediately perceive that it must\\nbe the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.  We were speaking the\\nother day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I\\nhad entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good\\nintentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help\\nsuspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,\\nhe had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became\\nconscious of a little attachment on her side.  One might guess\\ntwenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure\\nthere must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury\\ninstead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.  Here, she must be\\nleading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been\\nall enjoyment.  As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look\\nupon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;\\nbut what can any body\\'s native air do for them in the months\\nof January, February, and March?  Good fires and carriages would\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I\\ndare say in her\\'s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly\\ntell you what they are.\"\\n\\n\"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.\\nMr. Dixon\\'s preference of her music to her friend\\'s, I can answer\\nfor being very decided.\"\\n\\n\"And then, he saved her life.  Did you ever hear of that?--\\nA water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.\\nHe caught her.\"\\n\\n\"He did.  I was there--one of the party.\"\\n\\n\"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,\\nfor it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think\\nI should have made some discoveries.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,\\nthat Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\\ncaught her.--It was the work of a moment.  And though the consequent\\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I\\nbelieve it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--\\nyet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar\\nanxiety to be observable.  I do not mean to say, however, that you\\nmight not have made discoveries.\"\\n\\nThe conversation was here interrupted.  They were called on to share\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,\\nand obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when\\nthe table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\\nexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n\"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.  I wanted to know\\na little more, and this tells me quite enough.  Depend upon it,\\nwe shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\"\\n\\n\"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we\\nmust conclude it to come from the Campbells.\"\\n\\n\"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it\\nis not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.\\nShe would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.\\nI may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced\\nmyself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.  Your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely.  At first, while I\\nsupposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw\\nit only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing\\nin the world.  But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more\\nprobable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.\\nAnd now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.\"\\n\\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction\\nseemed real; he looked as if he felt it.  She said no more,\\nother subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;\\nthe dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked\\nto and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever\\nthings said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion\\nneither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,\\ndull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.\\n\\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,\\nin their different divisions, arrived.  Emma watched the entree of her\\nown particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity\\nand grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the\\nartless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,\\nunsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations\\nof pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.\\nThere she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had\\nbeen lately shedding?  To be in company, nicely dressed herself\\nand seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,\\nand say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.\\nJane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she\\nmight have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad\\nto have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having\\nloved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous\\npleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.\\n\\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much\\nin the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity\\nor interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;\\nbut by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,\\nand she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\\nwere received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \"my\\nexcellent friend Colonel Campbell.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\\nby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask\\nand to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious\\nof that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she\\nplainly read in the fair heroine\\'s countenance.\\n\\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the\\nearly was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the handsomest;\\nand after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and\\nher niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\\nwhere sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\\nwould not sit at all.  Emma divined what every body present must\\nbe thinking.  She was his object, and every body must perceive it.\\nShe introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient\\nmoments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  \"He had\\nnever seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.\"\\nAnd she, \"Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,\\nbut she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\"\\nEmma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.\\n\\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--\\nhated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--\\nthat his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left\\nvery busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,\\nhowever, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general\\na set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of\\nHighbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--\\nthat Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place\\nrather too much.  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--\\nthe extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;\\nand could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe\\nwas concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings\\nwere among a range of great families, none very near; and that even\\nwhen days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\\nchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,\\nthough he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,\\nwithout considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away,\\nor introduce an acquaintance for a night.\\n\\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,\\ntaken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more\\nretirement at home than he liked.  His importance at Enscombe was\\nvery evident.  He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,\\nthat he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,\\nand on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting\\none or two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing.\\nOne of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.\\nHe had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed\\nto be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had\\nhappened the year before.  _Now_, he said, he was beginning to have\\nno longer the same wish.\\n\\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed\\nto be good behaviour to his father.\\n\\n\"I have made a most wretched discovery,\" said he, after a short pause.--\\n\"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never knew\\ndays fly so fast.  A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to\\nenjoy myself.  But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--\\nI hate the recollection.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,\\nout of so few, in having your hair cut.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, smiling, \"that is no subject of regret at all.\\nI have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself\\nfit to be seen.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\\nWhen Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored\\nas before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room\\nat Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said she.\\n\\nHe started.  \"Thank you for rousing me,\" he replied.  \"I believe\\nI have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair\\nin so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes\\nfrom her.  I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must\\nbe a fancy of her own.  I see nobody else looking like her!--\\nI must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.  Shall I?--\\nYes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--\\nwhether she colours.\"\\n\\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly\\nin front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\\n\\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get\\nnear every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing\\nto talk to you.  I have been making discoveries and forming plans,\\njust like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.\\nDo you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"\\n\\n\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?\"\\n\\n\"They walked, I conclude.  How else could they come?\"\\n\\n\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,\\nand cold as the nights are now.  And as I looked at her, though I\\nnever saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she\\nwas heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.\\nPoor girl!  I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston\\ncame into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about\\nthe carriage.  You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;\\nand having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,\\nto assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took\\nus home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.\\nGood soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.\\n`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!\\'--but with many,\\nmany thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley\\'s\\ncarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.\\'  I was\\nquite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.\\nSuch a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--\\nthe sort of thing that so few men would think of.  And, in short,\\nfrom knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.\\nI do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,\\nand that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely.  I know no man\\nmore likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any\\nthing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.\\nHe is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,\\nconsidering Jane Fairfax\\'s ill-health, would appear a case\\nof humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,\\nthere is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.\\nI know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at\\nhim about it, but he said not a word that could betray.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for\\nmore simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;\\nfor while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,\\nand I have never been able to get it out again.  The more I think\\nof it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.  See the consequence\\nof keeping you company!--What do you say to it?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\" exclaimed Emma.  \"Dear Mrs. Weston,\\nhow could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley\\nmust not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--\\nOh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.  I cannot at all consent to\\nMr. Knightley\\'s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.\\nI am amazed that you should think of such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.\\nI do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--\\nbut the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley\\nreally wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry\\'s\\naccount, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I would.  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--\\nMr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I\\ncannot adopt it now.  And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you\\nvery well know.\"\\n\\n\"But the imprudence of such a match!\"\\n\\n\"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\"\\n\\n\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation\\nthan what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,\\nwould be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great\\nregard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--\\nand is always glad to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston,\\ndo not take to match-making.  You do it very ill.  Jane Fairfax mistress\\nof the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.  For his own sake,\\nI would not have him do so mad a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of fortune,\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\"\\n\\n\"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.  I am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it.  Do not put it into his head.  Why should he marry?--\\nHe is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,\\nand his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely\\nfond of his brother\\'s children.  He has no occasion to marry,\\neither to fill up his time or his heart.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\\nloves Jane Fairfax--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!  He does not care about Jane Fairfax.  In the way\\nof love, I am sure he does not.  He would do any good to her,\\nor her family; but--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he\\ncould do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\"\\n\\n\"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;\\na very shameful and degrading connexion.  How would he bear to have\\nMiss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,\\nand thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--\\n`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very\\nkind neighbour!\\'  And then fly off, through half a sentence,\\nto her mother\\'s old petticoat.  `Not that it was such a very old\\npetticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,\\nshe must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.\\'\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against\\nmy conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would\\nbe much disturbed by Miss Bates.  Little things do not irritate him.\\nShe might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would\\nonly talk louder, and drown her voice.  But the question is not,\\nwhether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;\\nand I think he does.  I have heard him speak, and so must you,\\nso very highly of Jane Fairfax!  The interest he takes in her--\\nhis anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no\\nhappier prospect!  I have heard him express himself so warmly on\\nthose points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,\\nand of her voice!  I have heard him say that he could listen to her\\nfor ever.  Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\nto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--\\nthough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present\\nfrom the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?  I cannot\\nhelp suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,\\neven without being in love.\"\\n\\n\"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.\\nBut I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.\\nMr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\\noftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\\ncourse of things, occur to him.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have\\ntold her so.\"\\n\\n\"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.  I have a very\\nstrong notion that it comes from him.  I am sure he was particularly\\nsilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\"\\n\\n\"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing.  I see no sign of attachment--\\nI believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince\\nme that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was\\nthe most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room\\nshewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--\\nand at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse\\nwould do them the honour of trying it.  Frank Churchill, of whom,\\nin the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been\\nseeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,\\nfollowed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,\\nin every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very\\nproper compliance.\\n\\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt\\nmore than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste\\nnor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,\\nand could accompany her own voice well.  One accompaniment to her song\\ntook her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly\\ntaken by Frank Churchill.  Her pardon was duly begged at the close\\nof the song, and every thing usual followed.  He was accused\\nof having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;\\nwhich was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,\\nand had no voice at all, roundly asserted.  They sang together\\nonce more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,\\nwhose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\\nattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\\n\\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen.  Frank Churchill sang again.\\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.\\nBut the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew\\naway half Emma\\'s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking\\non the subject of Mrs. Weston\\'s suspicions, to which the sweet\\nsounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.\\nHer objections to Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying did not in the least subside.\\nShe could see nothing but evil in it.  It would be a great\\ndisappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.\\nA real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,\\nand material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her\\nfather\\'s daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all\\nendure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.  A Mrs. Knightley\\nfor them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.\\nLittle Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.\\nThey talked at first only of the performance.  His admiration\\nwas certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,\\nit would not have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however,\\nshe began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;\\nand though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,\\nshe believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any\\nkindness of his own.\\n\\n\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;\\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James\\nshould put-to for such a purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\" he replied;--\\n\"but you must often wish it, I am sure.\"  And he smiled with such\\nseeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.\\n\\n\"This present from the Campbells,\" said she--\"this pianoforte\\nis very kindly given.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--\\n\"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.\\nSurprizes are foolish things.  The pleasure is not enhanced, and the\\ninconvenience is often considerable.  I should have expected better\\njudgment in Colonel Campbell.\"\\n\\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley\\nhad had no concern in giving the instrument.  But whether he\\nwere entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there\\nwere no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.\\nTowards the end of Jane\\'s second song, her voice grew thick.\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\\n\"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"\\n\\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would\\nnot fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for\\none more.\"  And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could\\nmanage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.\\nThe strength of the song falls on the second.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\\n\\n\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing\\noff his own voice.  This must not be.\"  And touching Miss Bates,\\nwho at that moment passed near--\"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let\\nyour niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?  Go, and interfere.\\nThey have no mercy on her.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even\\nto be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all\\nfarther singing.  Here ceased the concert part of the evening,\\nfor Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;\\nbut soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--\\noriginating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted\\nby Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,\\nto give proper space.  Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,\\nwas seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,\\ncoming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,\\nand led her up to the top.\\n\\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\\nvoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.\\nThis would be a trial.  He was no dancer in general.  If he were to be\\nvery alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.\\nThere was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole--\\nhe was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\\nand he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;\\nand she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.\\nNot more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the\\nsuddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well\\nmatched in a partner.  They were a couple worth looking at.\\n\\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.\\nIt was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,\\non her mother\\'s account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be\\npermitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,\\nlook sorrowful, and have done.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma\\nto her carriage.  \"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid\\ndancing would not have agreed with me, after your\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.\\nThe visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;\\nand all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side\\nof dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour\\nof popularity.  She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,\\nwho deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would\\nnot soon die away.\\n\\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were\\ntwo points on which she was not quite easy.  She doubted whether\\nshe had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying\\nher suspicions of Jane Fairfax\\'s feelings to Frank Churchill.\\nIt was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it\\nwould escape her, and his submission to all that she told,\\nwas a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult\\nfor her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.\\n\\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;\\nand there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally\\nregret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.  She did\\nmost heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat\\ndown and practised vigorously an hour and a half.\\n\\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet\\'s coming in; and if Harriet\\'s\\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\\n\\n\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t class us together, Harriet.  My playing is no more like\\nher\\'s, than a lamp is like sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.  I think you play\\nquite as well as she does.  I am sure I had much rather hear you.\\nEvery body last night said how well you played.\"\\n\\n\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.\\nThe truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\\nbut Jane Fairfax\\'s is much beyond it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,\\nor that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.\\nMr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked\\na great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more\\nthan execution.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?  I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had\\nany taste.  Nobody talked about it.  And I hate Italian singing.--\\nThere is no understanding a word of it.  Besides, if she does play\\nso very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,\\nbecause she will have to teach.  The Coxes were wondering last night\\nwhether she would get into any great family.  How did you think the\\nCoxes looked?\"\\n\\n\"Just as they always do--very vulgar.\"\\n\\n\"They told me something,\" said Harriet rather hesitatingly;\"\\nbut it is nothing of any consequence.\"\\n\\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful\\nof its producing Mr. Elton.\\n\\n\"They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him\\nto stay to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox.\\nI do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I\\nshould go and stay there again next summer.\"\\n\\n\"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox\\nshould be.\"\\n\\n\"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.  He sat\\nby her at dinner.  Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would\\nbe very glad to marry him.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\\ngirls in Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet had business at Ford\\'s.--Emma thought it most prudent to go\\nwith her.  Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible,\\nand in her present state, would be dangerous.\\n\\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--\\nMr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at\\nthe office-door, Mr. Cole\\'s carriage-horses returning from exercise,\\nor a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest\\nobjects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on\\nthe butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from\\nshop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,\\nand a string of dawdling children round the baker\\'s little bow-window\\neyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,\\nand was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.\\nA mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see\\nnothing that does not answer.\\n\\nShe looked down the Randalls road.  The scene enlarged;\\ntwo persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were\\nwalking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.  They were stopping,\\nhowever, in the first place at Mrs. Bates\\'s; whose house was\\na little nearer Randalls than Ford\\'s; and had all but knocked,\\nwhen Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road\\nand came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday\\'s\\nengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.\\nMrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,\\nin order to hear the new instrument.\\n\\n\"For my companion tells me,\" said she, \"that I absolutely promised\\nMiss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.  I was\\nnot aware of it myself.  I did not know that I had fixed a day,\\nbut as he says I did, I am going now.\"\\n\\n\"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill, \"to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--\\nif you are going home.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\\n\\n\"I thought you meant to go with me.  They would be very much pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Me!  I should be quite in the way.  But, perhaps--I may be equally\\nin the way here.  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.\\nMy aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.  She says I fidget\\nher to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say\\nthe same.  What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"I am here on no business of my own,\" said Emma; \"I am only waiting\\nfor my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we\\nshall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear\\nthe instrument.\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell\\nshould have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove\\nto have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?  I shall be no\\nsupport to Mrs. Weston.  She might do very well by herself.\\nA disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I\\nam the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded\\nthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;\\nbut there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.\\nQuite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax\\'s opinion\\nlast night.\"\\n\\n\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable\\nto you.  It need not detain us long.  We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\\nWe will follow them to Hartfield.  I really wish you to call with me.\\nIt will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you\\nmeant it.\"\\n\\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates\\'s door.  Emma watched them in,\\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,\\nbe it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.\\nAt last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\\n\\n\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard\\'s, ma\\'am?\" asked Mrs. Ford.--\\n\"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard\\'s. Only my pattern gown is\\nat Hartfield.  No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.\\nBut then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the\\npattern gown home any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--\\nso it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.  You could\\nmake it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?\"\\n\\n\"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble\\nof two parcels.\"\\n\\n\"No more it is.\"\\n\\n\"No trouble in the world, ma\\'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\\n\\n\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.\\nThen, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard\\'s--\\nI do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well\\nhave it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.\\nWhat do you advise?\"\\n\\n\"That you do not give another half-second to the subject.\\nTo Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, that will be much best,\" said Harriet, quite satisfied,\\n\"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard\\'s.\"\\n\\nVoices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:\\nMrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse,\" said the latter, \"I am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.\\nHow do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged\\nMrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"\\n\\n\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I am much obliged to you.  My mother is delightfully well;\\nand Jane caught no cold last night.  How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\\nto hear such a good account.  Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--\\nOh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will\\nallow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother\\nwill be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,\\nshe cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,\\' said Mr. Frank Churchill,\\n`Miss Woodhouse\\'s opinion of the instrument will be worth having.\\'--\\nBut, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go\\nwith me.--`Oh,\\' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished\\nmy job;\\'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,\\nin the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my\\nmother\\'s spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--\\nSo very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--\\ncould not put them on.  And, by the bye, every body ought to have\\ntwo pair of spectacles; they should indeed.  Jane said so.\\nI meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\\nthen another, there is no saying what, you know.  At one time Patty came\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.  Oh, said I,\\nPatty do not come with your bad news to me.  Here is the rivet\\nof your mistress\\'s spectacles out.  Then the baked apples came home,\\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and\\nobliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people\\nsay that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,\\nbut we have never known any thing but the greatest attention\\nfrom them.  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,\\nfor what is our consumption of bread, you know?  Only three of us.--\\nbesides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such\\na shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.\\nI dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one\\nthing and then I say another, and it passes off.  But about the\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes\\nso well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;\\nI happened to meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before--\\nI have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.\\nI believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the\\nfruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,\\nvery often.  Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,\\nMrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will\\noblige us.\"\\n\\nEmma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they\\ndid at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss\\nBates than,\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see\\nyou before.  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons\\nfrom town.  Jane came back delighted yesterday.  Thank ye,\\nthe gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;\\nbut Jane is taking them in.\"\\n\\n\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were\\nall in the street.\\n\\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\\n\\n\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my\\nmother\\'s spectacles.  So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!\\n`Oh!\\' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job\\nof this kind excessively.\\'--Which you know shewed him to be so\\nvery. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him\\nbefore and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any\\nthing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.\\nHe seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!\\' said he,\\n`I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of that sort excessively.\\'\\nI never shall forget his manner.  And when I brought out the baked\\napples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\\nobliging as to take some, `Oh!\\' said he directly, `there is nothing\\nin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.\\'  That, you know, was so\\nvery. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.\\nIndeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them\\nfull justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,\\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--\\nbut Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples\\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;\\nall from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley\\'s most liberal supply.\\nHe sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such\\na keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there\\nis two of them.  My mother says the orchard was always famous\\nin her younger days.  But I was really quite shocked the other day--\\nfor Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,\\nand we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,\\nand he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.\\n`I am sure you must be,\\' said he, `and I will send you\\nanother supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.\\nWilliam Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.\\nI will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.\\'\\nSo I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could\\nnot absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half\\na dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could\\nnot at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he\\nhad been already; and Jane said the same.  And when he was gone,\\nshe almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,\\nfor we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed\\nthat I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had\\nmade him believe we had a great many left.  Oh, said I, my dear,\\nI did say as much as I could.  However, the very same evening\\nWilliam Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same\\nsort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,\\nand went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,\\nas you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!\\nI am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found afterwards\\nfrom Patty, that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort\\nhis master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not\\none left to bake or boil.  William did not seem to mind it himself,\\nhe was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,\\nyou know, thinks more of his master\\'s profit than any thing;\\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being\\nall sent away.  She could not bear that her master should not be\\nable to have another apple-tart this spring.  He told Patty this,\\nbut bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us\\nabout it, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as\\nso many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.\\nAnd so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!\\nI would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for\\nthe world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from\\nJane\\'s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was\\naware.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\\n\\n\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.\\nPray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--\\nrather darker and narrower than one could wish.  Miss Smith,\\npray take care.  Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you\\nhit your foot.  Miss Smith, the step at the turning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,\\nwas tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table\\nnear her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\\n\\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\\nhappy countenance on seeing Emma again.\\n\\n\"This is a pleasure,\" said he, in rather a low voice, \"coming at\\nleast ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.  You find me\\ntrying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" said Mrs. Weston, \"have not you finished it yet? you would\\nnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\"\\n\\n\"I have not been working uninterruptedly,\" he replied, \"I have been\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.\\nYou see we have been wedging one leg with paper.  This was very kind\\nof you to be persuaded to come.  I was almost afraid you would be\\nhurrying home.\"\\n\\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying\\nto make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was\\nquite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not\\nimmediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;\\nshe had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it\\nwithout emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;\\nand Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,\\nand could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\\n\\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,\\nthe powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.\\nMrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;\\nEmma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every\\nproper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the\\nhighest promise.\\n\\n\"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\" said Frank Churchill,\\nwith a smile at Emma, \"the person has not chosen ill.  I heard a good\\ndeal of Colonel Campbell\\'s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the\\nupper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\\nparticularly prize.  I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave\\nhis friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.\\nDo not you think so?\"\\n\\nJane did not look round.  She was not obliged to hear.  Mrs. Weston\\nhad been speaking to her at the same moment.\\n\\n\"It is not fair,\" said Emma, in a whisper; \"mine was a random guess.\\nDo not distress her.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy.  Soon afterwards he began again,\\n\\n\"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure\\non this occasion, Miss Fairfax.  I dare say they often think of you,\\nand wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument\\'s\\ncoming to hand.  Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business\\nto be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be\\nthe consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may\\nhave sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,\\nto depend upon contingencies and conveniences?\"\\n\\nHe paused.  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\\n\\n\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice\\nof forced calmness, \"I can imagine nothing with any confidence.\\nIt must be all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes\\none conjectures wrong.  I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall\\nmake this rivet quite firm.  What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhen hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,\\nI suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get\\nhold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.\\nThere, it is done.  I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)\\nof restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.\"\\n\\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape\\na little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged\\nMiss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\\n\\n\"If you are very kind,\" said he, \"it will be one of the waltzes\\nwe danced last night;--let me live them over again.  You did not\\nenjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.  I believe\\nyou were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--\\nall the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.\"\\n\\nShe played.\\n\\n\"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy!--\\nIf I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\\nsomething else.  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\\nand turning to Emma, said,\\n\\n\"Here is something quite new to me.  Do you know it?--Cramer.--\\nAnd here are a new set of Irish melodies.  That, from such a quarter,\\none might expect.  This was all sent with the instrument.  Very thoughtful\\nof Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have\\nno music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly;\\nit shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.  Nothing hastily\\ndone; nothing incomplete.  True affection only could have prompted it.\"\\n\\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught\\nthe remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush\\nof consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,\\nshe had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction\\nwith respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax\\nwas apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.\\n\\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--\\nEmma took the opportunity of whispering,\\n\\n\"You speak too plain.  She must understand you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope she does.  I would have her understand me.  I am not\\nin the least ashamed of my meaning.\"\\n\\n\"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up\\nthe idea.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.\\nI have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.  Leave shame to her.\\nIf she does wrong, she ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"She is not entirely without it, I think.\"\\n\\n\"I do not see much sign of it.  She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_\\nat this moment--_his_ favourite.\"\\n\\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window,\\ndescried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,\\njust to thank him.  I will not open the window here; it would give\\nyou all cold; but I can go into my mother\\'s room you know.  I dare\\nsay he will come in when he knows who is here.  Quite delightful\\nto have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!\"\\n\\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening\\nthe casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley\\'s attention,\\nand every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard\\nby the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.\\n\\n\"How d\\' ye do?--how d\\'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.  So obliged\\nto you for the carriage last night.  We were just in time;\\nmy mother just ready for us.  Pray come in; do come in.  You will\\nfind some friends here.\"\\n\\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard\\nin his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\\n\\n\"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,\\nbut particularly your niece.  How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she\\ncaught no cold last night.  How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss\\nFairfax is.\"\\n\\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he\\nwould hear her in any thing else.  The listeners were amused;\\nand Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.  But Emma\\nstill shook her head in steady scepticism.\\n\\n\"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\"\\nresumed Miss Bates.\\n\\nHe cut her short with,\\n\\n\"I am going to Kingston.  Can I do any thing for you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day\\nshe wanted something from Kingston.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Cole has servants to send.  Can I do any thing for _you_?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you.  But do come in.  Who do you think is here?--\\nMiss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the\\nnew pianoforte.  Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, in a deliberating manner, \"for five minutes, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\\nso many friends!\"\\n\\n\"No, not now, I thank you.  I could not stay two minutes.\\nI must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do come in.  They will be so very happy to see you.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; your room is full enough.  I will call another day,\\nand hear the pianoforte.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh!  Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party\\nlast night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--\\nWas not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill;\\nI never saw any thing equal to it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose\\nMiss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing\\nthat passes.  And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss\\nFairfax should not be mentioned too.  I think Miss Fairfax dances\\nvery well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,\\nwithout exception, in England.  Now, if your friends have any gratitude,\\nthey will say something pretty loud about you and me in return;\\nbut I cannot stay to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--\\nso shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\"\\n\\n\"To think of your sending us all your store apples.  You said you had\\na great many, and now you have not one left.  We really are so shocked!\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry.  William Larkins mentioned it here.\\nYou should not have done it, indeed you should not.  Ah! he is off.\\nHe never can bear to be thanked.  But I thought he would have staid now,\\nand it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,\\n(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.\\nMr. Knightley cannot stop.  He is going to Kingston.  He asked me\\nif he could do any thing. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door\\nwas open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.\\nYou must have heard every thing to be sure.  `Can I do any thing\\nfor you at Kingston?\\' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so very\\nobliging of you.\"\\n\\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already\\nlasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was\\nperceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking\\nleave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young\\nladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have\\nbeen known of young people passing many, many months successively,\\nwithout being at any ball of any description, and no material injury\\naccrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--\\nwhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,\\nfelt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\\n\\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject.  Frank\\'s was the first idea;\\nand his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best\\njudge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation\\nand appearance.  But still she had inclination enough for shewing\\npeople again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare\\nherself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,\\nwithout any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first\\nin pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made\\nto hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,\\nin the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could\\nsay of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.\\n\\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole\\'s\\nshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\\nand the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.\\nMr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,\\nand Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they\\ncould wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,\\nof reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the\\nindispensable division of space to every couple.\\n\\n\"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two\\nMiss Coxes five,\" had been repeated many times over.  \"And there\\nwill be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,\\nbesides Mr. Knightley.  Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.\\nYou and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\\nCoxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.\"\\n\\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\\n\\n\"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\\nthere will.\"\\n\\nOn another,\\n\\n\"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth\\nwhile to stand up.  Five couple are nothing, when one thinks\\nseriously about it.  It will not do to _invite_ five couple.\\nIt can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.\"\\n\\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother\\'s,\\nand must be invited with the rest.  Somebody else believed\\n_Mrs_. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had\\nbeen asked.  A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,\\nMr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,\\nand another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,\\nit became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,\\nand a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they\\ncould be disposed of.\\n\\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.\\n\"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\"\\nIt seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that\\nmany of them wanted a better.  Emma said it would be awkward;\\nMrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse\\nopposed it earnestly, on the score of health.  It made him so\\nvery unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.\\n\\n\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence.\\nI could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would\\ncatch a dreadful cold.  So would poor little Harriet.\\nSo you would all.  Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;\\ndo not let them talk of such a wild thing.  Pray do not let them\\ntalk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.\\nDo not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.\\nHe has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping\\nthem open very inconsiderately.  He does not think of the draught.\\nI do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite\\nthe thing!\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.  She knew the importance\\nof it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.  Every door\\nwas now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme\\nof dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;\\nand with such good-will on Frank Churchill\\'s part, that the space\\nwhich a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient\\nfor five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough\\nfor ten.\\n\\n\"We were too magnificent,\" said he.  \"We allowed unnecessary room.\\nTen couple may stand here very well.\"\\n\\nEmma demurred.  \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could\\nbe worse than dancing without space to turn in?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\"  But still he\\nwent on measuring, and still he ended with,\\n\\n\"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said she, \"you are quite unreasonable.  It would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close!  Nothing can be farther from pleasure\\nthan to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\"\\n\\n\"There is no denying it,\" he replied.  \"I agree with you exactly.\\nA crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\\npictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,\\nhaving proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.\\nIt would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do\\nnot know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand\\nhere very well.\"\\n\\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure\\nof dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave\\nthe rest.  Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been\\nworth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value\\nof his preference, and the character of his temper; but for\\nall the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance\\nof the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the\\nterrors of my father\\'s little rooms.  I bring a new proposal\\non the subject:--a thought of my father\\'s, which waits only your\\napprobation to be acted upon.  May I hope for the honour of your\\nhand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,\\nto be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?\"\\n\\n\"The Crown!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\\nBetter accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\\nwelcome than at Randalls.  It is his own idea.  Mrs. Weston sees\\nno objection to it, provided you are satisfied.  This is what we\\nall feel.  Oh! you were perfectly right!  Ten couple, in either of\\nthe Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt\\nhow right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing\\n_any_ _thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--\\nI hope you consent?\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston do not.  I think it admirable; and, as far as I can\\nanswer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement\\nthat could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"\\n\\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations\\nwere necessary to make it acceptable.\\n\\n\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--\\nmuch worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp\\nand dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.\\nIf they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.  He had never\\nbeen in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people\\nwho kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.  They would catch\\nworse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill,\\n\"that one of the great recommendations of this change would\\nbe the very little danger of any body\\'s catching cold--\\nso much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!  Mr. Perry\\nmight have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \"you are very much\\nmistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.\\nMr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.  But I\\ndo not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you\\nthan your father\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.  We shall have\\nno occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;\\nand it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold\\nair upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\"\\n\\n\"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think\\nof opening the windows at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!\\nI never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,\\nneither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)\\nwould suffer it.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\\na window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.\\nI have often known it done myself.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.\\nBut I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.\\nHowever, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come\\nto talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal\\nof consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.\\nIf Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,\\nwe may talk it over, and see what can be done.\"\\n\\n\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking\\nevery thing over.  There is no hurry at all.  If it can be contrived\\nto be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.\\nThey will be so near their own stable.\"\\n\\n\"So they will, my dear.  That is a great thing.  Not that James\\never complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.\\nIf I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is\\nMrs. Stokes to be trusted?  I doubt it.  I do not know her,\\neven by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will\\nbe under Mrs. Weston\\'s care.  Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct\\nthe whole.\"\\n\\n\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,\\nwho is carefulness itself.  Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said,\\nso many years ago, when I had the measles?  `If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes\\nto wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.\\'  How often\\nhave I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true.  Mr. Perry did say so.  I shall never forget it.\\nPoor little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is,\\nyou would have been very bad, but for Perry\\'s great attention.\\nHe came four times a day for a week.  He said, from the first,\\nit was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles\\nare a dreadful complaint.  I hope whenever poor Isabella\\'s little ones\\nhave the measles, she will send for Perry.\"\\n\\n\"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house.\\nI left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,\\nand hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice\\non the spot.  I was desired to say so from both.  It would be the\\ngreatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.\\nThey can do nothing satisfactorily without you.\"\\n\\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young\\npeople set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,\\nvery busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some\\nlittle distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected.\\nLook! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot\\nis more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband.  \"What does\\nall that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight.\\nIt will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any\\nthing of it on our club-nights.\"\\n\\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \"Men never\\nknow when things are dirty or not;\" and the gentlemen perhaps\\nthought each to himself, \"Women will have their little nonsenses\\nand needless cares.\"\\n\\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\\nIt regarded a supper-room.  At the time of the ballroom\\'s being built,\\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,\\nwas the only addition.  What was to be done?  This card-room would\\nbe wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted\\nunnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for\\nany comfortable supper?  Another room of much better size might be\\nsecured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,\\nand a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.\\nThis made a difficulty.  Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts\\nfor the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the\\ngentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded\\nat supper.\\n\\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\\n&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a\\nwretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,\\nwas pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;\\nand Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.  She then took another\\nline of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\\n\\n\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\\nthrough the passage, was calling out,\\n\\n\"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.\\nIt is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from\\nthe stairs.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"one could know which arrangement our\\nguests in general would like best.  To do what would be most generally\\npleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true,\" cried Frank, \"very true.  You want your neighbours\\'\\nopinions.  I do not wonder at you.  If one could ascertain what the\\nchief of them--the Coles, for instance.  They are not far off.\\nShall I call upon them?  Or Miss Bates?  She is still nearer.--\\nAnd I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand\\nthe inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.  I think\\nwe do want a larger council.  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates\\nto join us?\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you please,\" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \"if you\\nthink she will be of any use.\"\\n\\n\"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\" said Emma.\\n\"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.\\nShe will not even listen to your questions.  I see no advantage in\\nconsulting Miss Bates.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!  I am very fond\\nof hearing Miss Bates talk.  And I need not bring the whole family,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,\\ngave it his decided approbation.\\n\\n\"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter\\nat once.  She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know\\na properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.\\nFetch Miss Bates.  We are growing a little too nice.  She is\\na standing lesson of how to be happy.  But fetch them both.\\nInvite them both.\"\\n\\n\"Both sir!  Can the old lady?\" . . .\\n\\n\"The old lady!  No, the young lady, to be sure.  I shall think you\\na great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  I beg your pardon, sir.  I did not immediately recollect.\\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\"\\nAnd away he ran.\\n\\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\\nand her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered\\nwoman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,\\nand found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--\\nindeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.\\nAll the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.\\nAll the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,\\ntea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles\\nto be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--\\nEvery body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written\\nto Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\\nwhich could not possibly be refused.  And a delightful dance it was\\nto be.\\n\\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\\nAs a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much\\nsafer character,) she was truly welcome.  Her approbation, at once\\ngeneral and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;\\nand for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,\\nbetween the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,\\nand all in happy enjoyment of the future.  The party did not break\\nup without Emma\\'s being positively secured for the two first dances\\nby the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston\\nwhisper to his wife, \"He has asked her, my dear.  That\\'s right.\\nI knew he would!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball\\ncompletely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within\\nthe granted term of Frank Churchill\\'s stay in Surry; for, in spite\\nof Mr. Weston\\'s confidence, she could not think it so very impossible\\nthat the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain\\na day beyond his fortnight.  But this was not judged feasible.\\nThe preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly\\nready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they\\nmust be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--\\nin her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.\\n\\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.\\nHis wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was\\nnot opposed.  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\\nsolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain\\nof her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley\\'s\\nprovoking indifference about it.  Either because he did not\\ndance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his\\nbeing consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,\\ndetermined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording\\nhim any future amusement.  To her voluntary communications Emma\\ncould get no more approving reply, than,\\n\\n\"Very well.  If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing\\nto say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--\\nOh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep\\nas much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over\\nWilliam Larkins\\'s week\\'s account; much rather, I confess.--\\nPleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--\\nI do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,\\nmust be its own reward.  Those who are standing by are usually\\nthinking of something very different.\"\\n\\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.\\nIt was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was\\nso indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings\\nin reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it\\nto an extraordinary degree.  It made her animated--open hearted--\\nshe voluntarily said;--\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\\nWhat a disappointment it would be!  I do look forward to it, I own,\\nwith _very_ great pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\\npreferred the society of William Larkins.  No!--she was more and more\\nconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.\\nThere was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment\\non his side--but no love.\\n\\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.\\nTwo days of joyful security were immediately followed by the\\nover-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill\\nto urge his nephew\\'s instant return.  Mrs. Churchill was unwell--\\nfar too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering\\nstate (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,\\nthough from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant\\nhabit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;\\nbut now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off\\nfor Enscombe without delay.\\n\\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note\\nfrom Mrs. Weston, instantly.  As to his going, it was inevitable.\\nHe must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real\\nalarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.  He knew her illnesses;\\nthey never occurred but for her own convenience.\\n\\nMrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to\\nhurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few\\nfriends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;\\nand that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.\"\\n\\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma\\'s breakfast.  When once\\nit had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament\\nand exclaim.  The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--\\nand all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--\\nSuch a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!\\nand she and her partner the happiest!--\"I said it would be so,\"\\nwas the only consolation.\\n\\nHer father\\'s feelings were quite distinct.  He thought principally\\nof Mrs. Churchill\\'s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;\\nand as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;\\nbut they would all be safer at home.\\n\\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;\\nbut if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful\\nlook and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.\\nHe felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.  His dejection\\nwas most evident.  He sat really lost in thought for the first\\nfew minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,\\n\\n\"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\"\\n\\n\"But you will come again,\" said Emma.  \"This will not be your only\\nvisit to Randalls.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able\\nto return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object\\nof all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town\\nthis spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--\\nI am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Our poor ball must be quite given up.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\\npleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\\nfoolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhy are you always so right?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.  I would\\nmuch rather have been merry than wise.\"\\n\\n\"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.  My father\\ndepends on it.  Do not forget your engagement.\"\\n\\nEmma looked graciously.\\n\\n\"Such a fortnight as it has been!\" he continued; \"every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\\nme less fit to bear any other place.  Happy those, who can remain\\nat Highbury!\"\\n\\n\"As you do us such ample justice now,\" said Emma, laughing, \"I will\\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations?  I am sure we do.\\nI am sure you did not much expect to like us.  You would not have been\\nso long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\"\\n\\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,\\nEmma was convinced that it had been so.\\n\\n\"And you must be off this very morning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,\\nand I must be off immediately.  I am almost afraid that every moment\\nwill bring him.\"\\n\\n\"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and\\nMiss Bates?  How unlucky!  Miss Bates\\'s powerful, argumentative mind\\nmight have strengthened yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better.\\nIt was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was\\ndetained by Miss Bates\\'s being absent.  She was out; and I felt it\\nimpossible not to wait till she came in.  She is a woman that one may,\\nthat one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.\\nIt was better to pay my visit, then\"--\\n\\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\\n\\n\"In short,\" said he, \"perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can\\nhardly be quite without suspicion\"--\\n\\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.  She hardly\\nknew what to say.  It seemed like the forerunner of something\\nabsolutely serious, which she did not wish.  Forcing herself\\nto speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then\"--\\n\\nHe was silent.  She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.\\nShe heard him sigh.  It was natural for him to feel that he had\\n_cause_ to sigh.  He could not believe her to be encouraging him.\\nA few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more\\ndetermined manner said,\\n\\n\"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be\\ngiven to Hartfield.  My regard for Hartfield is most warm\"--\\n\\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--\\nHe was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say\\nhow it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?\\nMr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made\\nhim composed.\\n\\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.\\nMr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as\\nincapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,\\nas of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, \"It was time to go;\"\\nand the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,\\nto take leave.\\n\\n\"I shall hear about you all,\" said he; \"that is my chief consolation.\\nI shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.  I have\\nengaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.  She has been so kind as\\nto promise it.  Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one\\nis really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.\\nIn her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.\"\\n\\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \"Good-bye,\"\\nclosed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.\\nShort had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma\\nfelt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little\\nsociety from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,\\nand feeling it too much.\\n\\nIt was a sad change.  They had been meeting almost every day\\nsince his arrival.  Certainly his being at Randalls had given\\ngreat spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,\\nthe expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,\\nthe assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!\\nIt had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking\\nfrom it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every\\nother recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her.\\nWhat strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,\\nwas another point; but at present she could not doubt his having\\na decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;\\nand this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that\\nshe _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous\\ndetermination against it.\\n\\n\"I certainly must,\" said she.  \"This sensation of listlessness,\\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\\nthis feeling of every thing\\'s being dull and insipid about the house!--\\nI must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\\nwere not--for a few weeks at least.  Well! evil to some is always\\ngood to others.  I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,\\nif not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.\\nHe may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.  He could\\nnot say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look\\nwould have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,\\nthat he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\\nconsiderable kindness added,\\n\\n\"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\\nout of luck; you are very much out of luck!\"\\n\\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her\\nhonest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,\\nher composure was odious.  She had been particularly unwell, however,\\nsuffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,\\nthat had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have\\nattended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming\\nindifference to the languor of ill-health.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.  Her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much.  At first, she thought it was a good deal;\\nand afterwards, but little.  She had great pleasure in hearing Frank\\nChurchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\\nin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\\nand quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,\\nhow were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance\\nof his coming to Randalls again this spring.  But, on the other hand,\\nshe could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the\\nfirst morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;\\nshe was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could\\nyet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him\\nso much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand\\namusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,\\nfancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;\\nthe conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\\n_refused_ _him_.  Their affection was always to subside into friendship.\\nEvery thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;\\nbut still they were to part.  When she became sensible of this,\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite\\nof her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,\\nnever to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more\\nof a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\\n\\n\"I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\" said she.--\\n\"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,\\nis there any allusion to making a sacrifice.  I do suspect that he\\nis not really necessary to my happiness.  So much the better.\\nI certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.  I am\\nquite enough in love.  I should be sorry to be more.\"\\n\\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\\n\\n\"_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much\\nin love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,\\nI must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\\ninexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.\\nNot that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.\\nNo, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would\\nnot have been so wretched.  Could he have thought himself encouraged,\\nhis looks and language at parting would have been different.--\\nStill, however, I must be on my guard.  This is in the supposition\\nof his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I\\nexpect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man--\\nI do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--\\nHis feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--\\nEvery consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful\\nthat my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well\\nagain after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;\\nfor they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall\\nhave been let off easily.\"\\n\\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;\\nand she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made\\nher at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she\\nhad undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,\\ngiving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,\\nexpressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was\\nnatural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local\\nthat could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.\\nNo suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the\\nlanguage of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition\\nfrom Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some\\nof the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on\\nto shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been\\nsaid but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own\\nname was not wanting.  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once,\\nand never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\\ncompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;\\nand in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it\\nwas by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern\\nthe effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment\\nperhaps of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant\\ncorner were these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,\\nas you know, for Miss Woodhouse\\'s beautiful little friend.  Pray make\\nmy excuses and adieus to her.\"  This, Emma could not doubt, was all\\nfor herself.  Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend.\\nHis information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor\\nbetter than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,\\nand he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for\\ncoming to Randalls again.\\n\\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the\\nmaterial part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up\\nand returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,\\nthat she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn\\nto do without her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution\\nof refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for\\nhis subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,\\nand the words which clothed it, the \"beautiful little friend,\"\\nsuggested to her the idea of Harriet\\'s succeeding her in his affections.\\nWas it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his\\ninferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with\\nthe loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;\\nand all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in\\nher favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\\n\\n\"I must not dwell upon it,\" said she.--\"I must not think of it.\\nI know the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger\\nthings have happened; and when we cease to care for each other\\nas we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort\\nof true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward\\nto with pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet\\'s behalf,\\nthough it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil\\nin that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill\\'s arrival had\\nsucceeded Mr. Elton\\'s engagement in the conversation of Highbury,\\nas the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now\\nupon Frank Churchill\\'s disappearance, Mr. Elton\\'s concerns were\\nassuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.\\nHe would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.\\nThere was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe\\nbefore \"Mr. Elton and his bride\" was in every body\\'s mouth,\\nand Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound.\\nShe had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;\\nand Harriet\\'s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately\\ngaining strength.  With Mr. Weston\\'s ball in view at least,\\nthere had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;\\nbut it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state\\nof composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,\\nbell-ringing, and all.\\n\\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma\\ncould give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,\\nthat Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;\\nbut it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing\\nany effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions\\nthe same.  Harriet listened submissively, and said \"it was very true--\\nit was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to\\nthink about them--and she would not think about them any longer\"\\nbut no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour\\nsaw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.\\nAt last Emma attacked her on another ground.\\n\\n\"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about\\nMr. Elton\\'s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can\\nmake _me_.  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I\\nfell into.  It was all my doing, I know.  I have not forgotten it,\\nI assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--\\nand it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.  Do not imagine\\nme in danger of forgetting it.\"\\n\\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words\\nof eager exclamation.  Emma continued,\\n\\n\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,\\ntalk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,\\nI would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important\\nthan my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration\\nof what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour\\nto avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,\\nand restore your tranquillity.  These are the motives which I\\nhave been pressing on you.  They are very important--and sorry\\nI am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.\\nMy being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.  I want\\nyou to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes\\nhave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather\\nwhat would be kind by me.\"\\n\\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.\\nThe idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,\\nand when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained\\npowerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it\\nvery tolerably.\\n\\n\"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--\\nWant gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody\\nas I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\"\\n\\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look\\nand manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet\\nso well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\\n\\n\"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\" said she\\nafterwards to herself.  \"There is nothing to be compared to it.\\nWarmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,\\nwill beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,\\nI am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear\\nfather so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--\\nI have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is\\nmy superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.\\nDear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,\\nlongest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness\\nof a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--\\na sensible man\\'s wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;\\nbut happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might\\nbe interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,\\nand it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,\\nto settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,\\nor not pretty at all.\\n\\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,\\nto make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;\\nand she made a point of Harriet\\'s going with her, that the worst of\\nthe business might be gone through as soon as possible.\\n\\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room\\nto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,\\nto lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious\\nthoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;\\nand it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be\\nrecollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather\\npale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so\\nmuch embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma\\nwould not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,\\nand on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms\\nof being \"elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\"\\n\\nShe did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,\\nthere was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face\\nnot unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,\\nwere elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would\\nnot permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.\\nIt was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,\\nand a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.\\nThe woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,\\nand the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own\\ngood sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly\\nunlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with\\nthe woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,\\nand the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him\\nto have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,\\nand as little really easy as could be.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted\\nthe house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--\\nIs not she very charming?\"\\n\\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma\\'s answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\"\\n\\n\"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;\\nand she came in his way.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" returned Harriet, sighing again, \"I dare say she\\nwas very much attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man\\'s fate to marry the\\nwoman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,\\nand thought this the best offer she was likely to have.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\\nhave a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,\\nMiss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.\\nHe is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,\\nit is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need\\nnot be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.\\nTo know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--\\nShe does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.\\nHappy creature!  He called her `Augusta.\\'  How delightful!\"\\n\\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then\\nsee more and judge better.  From Harriet\\'s happening not to be\\nat Hartfield, and her father\\'s being present to engage Mr. Elton,\\nshe had a quarter of an hour of the lady\\'s conversation to herself,\\nand could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite\\nconvinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well\\nsatisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;\\nthat she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which\\nhad been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her\\nnotions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;\\nthat if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would\\ncertainly do Mr. Elton no good.\\n\\nHarriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,\\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,\\nit might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best\\nof her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride\\nof the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride\\nof him.\\n\\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother\\nMr. Suckling\\'s seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.\\nThe grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the\\nhouse was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably\\nimpressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she\\ncould see or imagine.  \"Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite\\nstruck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size\\nof the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister\\'s favourite room.\"--\\nMr. Elton was appealed to.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?--\\nShe could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like\\nthe staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.\\nI really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nit is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so\\nextremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy\\nmonths there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,\\nundoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;\\nbut to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,\\nlike me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it\\nis to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.\\nI always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.\"\\n\\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\\n\\n\"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--\\nthe grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly\\nlike.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,\\nand stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;\\nand I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,\\nwhich put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be\\nenchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds\\nthemselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.\"\\n\\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea\\nthat people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little\\nfor the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth\\nwhile to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said\\nin reply,\\n\\n\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\\nyou have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,\\nyou know.  Surry is the garden of England.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.\\nMany counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,\\nas well as Surry.\"\\n\\n\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\"\\nI never heard any county but Surry called so.\"\\n\\nEmma was silenced.\\n\\n\"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,\\nor summer at farthest,\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"and that will be\\nour time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore\\na great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,\\nof course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying\\nany thing of _our_ carriage, we should be able to explore the different\\nbeauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,\\nI think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,\\nI shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;\\nit will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful\\ncountry of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes\\nthem to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond\\nof exploring.  We explored to King\\'s-Weston twice last summer,\\nin that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the\\nbarouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,\\nMiss Woodhouse, every summer?\"\\n\\n\"No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;\\nand we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed\\nto stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.\\nNobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite\\na proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,\\nwhen she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl\\nto move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I\\nhate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;\\nbut Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir\\nbeyond the park paling.\\'  Many a time has she said so; and yet I\\nam no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\\nbad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\na proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.\\nI perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--\\n(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father\\'s state of health must\\nbe a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.\\nLet me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing\\nMr. Woodhouse good.\"\\n\\n\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving\\nany benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown\\nto you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be\\nuseful now.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that\\'s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhere the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief\\nthey give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!\\nAnd it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of\\nuse to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes\\nmuch depressed.  And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I\\nneed not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath\\nto the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming\\nintroduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could\\nimmediately secure you some of the best society in the place.\\nA line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my\\nparticular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided\\nwith when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,\\nand would be the very person for you to go into public with.\"\\n\\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.\\nThe idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called\\nan _introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices\\nof a friend of Mrs. Elton\\'s--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,\\nwho, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--\\nThe dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\\n\\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\\nhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going\\nto Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly\\nconvinced that the place might suit her better than her father.\"\\nAnd then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the\\nsubject directly.\\n\\n\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,\\na lady\\'s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long\\nknown that you are a superior performer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.\\nA superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.\\nConsider from how partial a quarter your information came.\\nI am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends\\nsay I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,\\nupon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree.\\nYou, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you\\nit has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,\\nto hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot\\ndo without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always\\nbeen used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,\\nit would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much\\nto Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing\\nhis fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;\\nand the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been\\naccustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear\\nof retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,\\nthe world was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it.\\nTo those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my\\nresources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms\\nthan I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.\\nI hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.\\nCertainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I\\ndid assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,\\nnor were spacious apartments.  `But,\\' said I, `to be quite honest,\\nI do not think I can live without something of a musical society.\\nI condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank\\nto me.\\'\"\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury;\\nand I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\\nmay be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted\\nto find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet\\nlittle concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I\\nmust establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings\\nat your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If _we_\\nexert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.\\nSomething of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_,\\nas an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--\\nthere is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt\\nto give up music.\"\\n\\n\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can\\nbe no danger, surely?\"\\n\\n\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\\nI tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never touches\\nthe instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said\\nof Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,\\nnow Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.\\nUpon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be\\nquite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend\\nthat a married woman has many things to call her attention.\\nI believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.\"\\n\\n\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon\\nbe in so regular a train--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \"we shall see.\"\\n\\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,\\nhad nothing more to say; and, after a moment\\'s pause, Mrs. Elton\\nchose another subject.\\n\\n\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them\\nboth at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.\\nI like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--\\nquite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.\\nAnd _she_ appears so truly good--there is something so motherly\\nand kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.\\nShe was your governess, I think?\"\\n\\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton\\nhardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.\\n\\n\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her\\nso very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Weston\\'s manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good.\\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"And who do you think came in while we were there?\"\\n\\nEmma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--\\nand how could she possibly guess?\\n\\n\"Knightley!\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"Knightley himself!--Was not\\nit lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,\\nI had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a\\nfriend of Mr. E.\\'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley\\'\\nhad been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;\\nand I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not\\nbe ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman.\\nI like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\"\\n\\nHappily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma\\ncould breathe.\\n\\n\"Insufferable woman!\" was her immediate exclamation.  \"Worse than I\\nhad supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not\\nhave believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,\\nand call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!\\nA little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_,\\nand her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and\\nunderbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is\\na gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,\\nand discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it!\\nAnd to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!\\nOne would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--\\nAstonished that the person who had brought me up should be\\na gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal.\\nMuch beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.\\nOh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?\\nHow angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--\\nthinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of!\\nHow I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into\\nmy mind!\"--\\n\\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time\\nher father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons\\'\\ndeparture, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable\\nof attending.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" he deliberately began, \"considering we never saw\\nher before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say\\nshe was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick.\\nA little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.\\nBut I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks\\nlike you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,\\npretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.\\nThough I think he had better not have married.  I made the best\\nexcuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton\\non this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course\\nof the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon\\na bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!\\nBut I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects\\nto her if possible.  It was being very deficient.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore\\nwhy should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?\\nIt ought to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people\\nto marry if you make so much of them.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would\\nalways wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,\\nespecially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.\\nA bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,\\nlet the others be who they may.\"\\n\\n\"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know\\nwhat is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your\\nsanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a\\nmatter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,\\nand has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.\"\\n\\nEmma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not\\nunderstand _her_.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton\\'s offences,\\nand long, very long, did they occupy her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\\nopinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct.\\nSuch as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,\\nsuch she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,\\nfamiliar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a\\nlittle accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself\\ncoming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve\\na country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held\\nsuch a place in society as Mrs. Elton\\'s consequence only could surpass.\\n\\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\\nfrom his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.\\nHe had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such\\na woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;\\nand the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,\\nor not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates\\'s\\ngood-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever\\nand as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;\\nso that Mrs. Elton\\'s praise passed from one mouth to another as it\\nought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her\\nfirst contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \"very\\npleasant and very elegantly dressed.\"\\n\\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared\\nat first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,\\nby the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,\\nshe drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\\nand distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will\\nwhich produced it was necessarily increasing Emma\\'s dislike.\\nHer manners, too--and Mr. Elton\\'s, were unpleasant towards Harriet.\\nThey were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work\\nHarriet\\'s cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour\\nsunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor\\nHarriet\\'s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,\\nand her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable\\nto her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been\\ngiven also.  She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--\\nWhen they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin\\nabusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew\\nin open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous\\ntreatment of Harriet.\\n\\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.\\nNot merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be\\nsupposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she\\nwas not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--\\nbut without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting\\nto assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,\\nand about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton\\'s\\nknight-errantry on the subject.--\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite\\nrave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.  So mild\\nand ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she\\nhas very extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she\\nplays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly\\non that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at\\nmy warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--\\nAnd her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,\\nwe must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.\\nWe must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered\\nto remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of\\nthe poet,\\n\\n        `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\n          `And waste its fragrance on the desert air.\\'\\n\\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot think there is any danger of it,\" was Emma\\'s calm answer--\\n\"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax\\'s situation\\nand understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,\\nI have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,\\nsuch obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have\\nenjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!  And I think\\nshe feels it.  I am sure she does.  She is very timid and silent.\\nOne can see that she feels the want of encouragement.  I like her\\nthe better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me.\\nI am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does\\nnot often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,\\nit is extremely prepossessing.  Oh!  I assure you, Jane Fairfax\\nis a very delightful character, and interests me more than I\\ncan express.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any\\nof Miss Fairfax\\'s acquaintance here, any of those who have known\\nher longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than\"--\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare\\nto act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If _we_ set the example,\\nmany will follow it as far as they can; though all have not\\nour situations.  _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home,\\nand _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of\\nJane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be\\nextremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,\\nas could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax\\nto partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is\\nnot likely that I _should_, considering what I have been used to.\\nMy greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.\\nMaple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--\\nfor we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,\\nin income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--\\nI shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce\\nher wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,\\nand shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.\\nMy acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt\\nof hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,\\nof course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come\\nto us.  I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets\\na little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,\\nfor there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is\\nhighly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they\\nare with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in\\nthe barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Jane Fairfax!\"--thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this.\\nYou may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a\\npunishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection\\nof Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.\\'  Heavens!  Let me\\nnot suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--\\nBut upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness\\nof that woman\\'s tongue!\"\\n\\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\\naddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \"dear Miss\\nWoodhouse.\"  The change on Mrs. Elton\\'s side soon afterwards appeared,\\nand she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton\\'s guidance, the very\\nactive patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a\\ngeneral way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\\n\\nShe looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates\\'s gratitude for\\nMrs. Elton\\'s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--\\nthe most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished\\nand condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.\\nEmma\\'s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept\\nthose attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.\\nShe heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,\\nspending a day with the Eltons!  This was astonishing!--She could not\\nhave believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax\\ncould endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\\n\\n\"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!\" said she.--\"To chuse to remain\\nhere month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now\\nto chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton\\'s notice and the penury\\nof her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions\\nwho have always loved her with such real, generous affection.\"\\n\\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells\\nhad promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,\\nand fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.\\nAccording to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had\\nwritten most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,\\nservants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed\\nto exist; but still she had declined it!\\n\\n\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\\nthis invitation,\" was Emma\\'s conclusion.  \"She must be under some\\nsort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.\\nThere is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--\\nShe is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_.  The decree is issued by somebody.\\nBut why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a\\nseparate puzzle.\"\\n\\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,\\nbefore the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston\\nventured this apology for Jane.\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\\nmy dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.\\nHer aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,\\nmust be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,\\nbefore we condemn her taste for what she goes to.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have\\nchosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives\\nattentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;\\nand she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,\\nshe presently replied,\\n\\n\"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton\\'s, I should have imagined,\\nwould rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton\\'s\\ninvitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.\"\\n\\n\"I should not wonder,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if Miss Fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt\\'s eagerness\\nin accepting Mrs. Elton\\'s civilities for her.  Poor Miss Bates may\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,\\nin spite of the very natural wish of a little change.\"\\n\\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\\nminutes silence, he said,\\n\\n\"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton\\ndoes not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her.  We all know\\nthe difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest\\nspoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond\\ncommon civility in our personal intercourse with each other--\\na something more early implanted.  We cannot give any body the\\ndisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.\\nWe feel things differently.  And besides the operation of this,\\nas a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes\\nMrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,\\nface to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she\\nhas a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell\\nin Mrs. Elton\\'s way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent\\nher acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not\\nin consciousness.\"\\n\\n\"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\" said Emma.\\nLittle Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy\\nmade her irresolute what else to say.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"any body may know how highly I think of her.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,\\nbut soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--\\nshe hurried on--\"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself\\nhow highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by\\nsurprize some day or other.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,\\nor some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\\n\\n\"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.  Mr. Cole\\ngave me a hint of it six weeks ago.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did\\nnot herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--\\n\\n\"That will never be, however, I can assure you.  Miss Fairfax,\\nI dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very\\nsure I shall never ask her.\"\\n\\nEmma returned her friend\\'s pressure with interest; and was pleased\\nenough to exclaim,\\n\\n\"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you.\"\\n\\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner\\nwhich shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you.  What I said\\njust now, meant nothing.  One says those sort of things, of course,\\nwithout any idea of a serious meaning.  Oh! no, upon my word I have not\\nthe smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.\\nYou would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,\\nif you were married.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,\\n\"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will\\never take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,\\nI assure you.\"  And soon afterwards, \"Jane Fairfax is a very charming\\nyoung woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.  She has a fault.\\nShe has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\"\\n\\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.\\n\"Well,\" said she, \"and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser\\nor wittier than his neighbours.\"\\n\\n\"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser\\nand wittier than all the world!  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--\\nwhat she calls them!  How can she find any appellation for them,\\ndeep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can\\nshe do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane\\nFairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.\\nMrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more\\nreadily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,\\nthan I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax\\'s mind over\\nMrs. Elton.  I have no faith in Mrs. Elton\\'s acknowledging herself\\nthe inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any\\nrestraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot\\nimagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\"\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax has feeling,\" said Mr. Knightley--\"I do not\\naccuse her of want of feeling.  Her sensibilities, I suspect,\\nare strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,\\npatience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,\\nmore reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an\\nopen temper.  No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,\\nit had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with\\nher, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mrs. Weston,\" said Emma triumphantly when he left them,\\n\"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied\\nby the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder\\nif it were to end in his being so at last.  Do not beat me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,\\nwas disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and\\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations\\nflowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending\\nthey were never to have a disengaged day.\\n\\n\"I see how it is,\" said she.  \"I see what a life I am to lead\\namong you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.\\nWe really seem quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country,\\nit is nothing very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday,\\nI assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer\\nresources than I have, need not have been at a loss.\"\\n\\nNo invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties\\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste\\nfor dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two\\ndrawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being\\nno ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,\\nMrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge\\nof the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought\\nto be arranged.  In the course of the spring she must return their\\ncivilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables\\nshould be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs\\nin the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening\\nthan their own establishment could furnish, to carry round\\nthe refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\\n\\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner\\nat Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others,\\nor she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable\\nof pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had\\ntalked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,\\nand only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\\nof the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding\\nwho should do it for him.\\n\\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,\\nit must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--\\nand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given\\nwith equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly\\npleased by Harriet\\'s begging to be allowed to decline it.\\n\"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.\\nShe was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\\nwife together, without feeling uncomfortable.  If Miss Woodhouse\\nwould not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.\"\\nIt was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it\\npossible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude\\nof her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give\\nup being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,\\nshe was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had\\noften been.--Mr. Knightley\\'s words dwelt with her.  He had said\\nthat Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody\\nelse paid her.\\n\\n\"This is very true,\" said she, \"at least as far as relates to me,\\nwhich was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--\\nand always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--\\nShe will never like me now.  I have neglected her too long.  But I\\nwill shew her greater attention than I have done.\"\\n\\nEvery invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all happy.--\\nThe preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.\\nA circumstance rather unlucky occurred.  The two eldest little\\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of\\nsome weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,\\nand staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be\\nthe very day of this party.--His professional engagements did\\nnot allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were\\ndisturbed by its happening so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight\\npersons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--\\nand here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would\\nbe a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even\\nto Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.\\n\\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,\\nby representing that though he certainly would make them nine,\\nyet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be\\nvery immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,\\nto have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed\\nto her instead of his brother.\\n\\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.\\nJohn Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town\\nand must be absent on the very day.  He might be able to join them\\nin the evening, but certainly not to dinner.  Mr. Woodhouse was quite\\nat ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys\\nand the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,\\nremoved the chief of even Emma\\'s vexation.\\n\\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley\\nseemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.\\nInstead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited\\nfor dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant\\nas lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--\\nwanting only to observe enough for Isabella\\'s information--but Miss\\nFairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\\ntalk to her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning\\nfrom a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning\\nto rain.  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,\\nand he said,\\n\\n\"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I\\nam sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.\\nI hope you turned directly.\"\\n\\n\"I went only to the post-office,\" said she, \"and reached home\\nbefore the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch\\nthe letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something\\nto get me out.  A walk before breakfast does me good.\"\\n\\n\"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\"\\n\\n\"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\\n\\n\"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\\nyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;\\nand Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\\nThe post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.\\nWhen you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are\\nnever worth going through the rain for.\"\\n\\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\\n\\n\"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of\\nevery dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply\\ngrowing older should make me indifferent about letters.\"\\n\\n\"Indifferent!  Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\\npositive curse.\"\\n\\n\"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters\\nof friendship.\"\\n\\n\"I have often thought them the worst of the two,\" replied he coolly.\\n\"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly\\never does.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are not serious now.  I know Mr. John Knightley too well--\\nI am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as\\nany body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you,\\nmuch less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than\\nmyself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.\\nYou have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,\\nnever shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,\\na post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,\\nin worse weather than to-day.\"\\n\\n\"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\"\\nsaid John Knightley, \"I meant to imply the change of situation\\nwhich time usually brings.  I consider one as including the other.\\nTime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within\\nthe daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.\\nAs an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten\\nyears hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\"\\n\\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant\\n\"thank you\" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,\\na tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.\\nHer attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,\\naccording to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of\\nhis guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,\\nwas ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,\\n\\n\"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this\\nmorning in the rain.  Young ladies should take care of themselves.--\\nYoung ladies are delicate plants.  They should take care of their\\nhealth and their complexion.  My dear, did you change your stockings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--\\nI hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.  They are some\\nof my very old friends.  I wish my health allowed me to be a\\nbetter neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.\\nMy daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,\\nand have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel\\nthat he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\\n\\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,\\nand her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office\\nin the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,\\nhow could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there\\nto take care of you.\"\\n\\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\\n\\n\"Oh! do not tell _me_.  You really are a very sad girl, and do not\\nknow how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!\\nMrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?  You and I must positively\\nexert our authority.\"\\n\\n\"My advice,\" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \"I certainly\\ndo feel tempted to give.  Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--\\nLiable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought\\nto be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.\\nThe spring I always think requires more than common care.\\nBetter wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,\\nthan run the risk of bringing on your cough again.  Now do not you\\nfeel that you had?  Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.\\nYou look as if you would not do such a thing again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined\\nMrs. Elton.  \"We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"--\\nand nodding significantly--\"there must be some arrangement made,\\nthere must indeed.  I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches\\nour letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)\\nshall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.  That will obviate\\nall difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane,\\nyou can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.\"\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" said Jane; \"but I cannot give up my\\nearly walk.  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,\\nI must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon\\nmy word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, say no more about it.  The thing is determined,\\nthat is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine\\nany thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.  You know,\\nMrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.\\nBut I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely\\nworn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,\\nconsider that point as settled.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Jane earnestly, \"I cannot by any means consent\\nto such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.\\nIf the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it\\nalways is when I am not here, by my grandmama\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness\\nto employ our men.\"\\n\\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead\\nof answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\\n\\n\"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\" said she.--\\n\"The regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it\\nhas to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly very well regulated.\"\\n\\n\"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom\\nthat a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing\\nabout the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,\\nI suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety\\nof hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,\\nit increases the wonder.\"\\n\\n\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some\\nquickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you\\nwant any farther explanation,\" continued he, smiling, \"they are\\npaid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity.\\nThe public pays and must be served well.\"\\n\\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\\nobservations made.\\n\\n\"I have heard it asserted,\" said John Knightley, \"that the same\\nsort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the\\nsame master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,\\nI should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,\\nfor boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble\\ninto any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write\\nvery much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother hesitatingly, \"there is a likeness.\\nI know what you mean--but Emma\\'s hand is the strongest.\"\\n\\n\"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\" said Mr. Woodhouse;\\n\"and always did.  And so does poor Mrs. Weston\"--with half a sigh\\nand half a smile at her.\\n\\n\"I never saw any gentleman\\'s handwriting\"--Emma began, looking also\\nat Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was\\nattending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,\\n\"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking\\nhis name at once before all these people?  Is it necessary\\nfor me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--\\nyour correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,\\nif I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the\\nsmallest distress.  I certainly get better and better.--Now for it.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr. Frank Churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentleman\\'s hands I ever saw.\"\\n\\n\"I do not admire it,\" said Mr. Knightley.  \"It is too small--\\nwants strength.  It is like a woman\\'s writing.\"\\n\\nThis was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him\\nagainst the base aspersion.  \"No, it by no means wanted strength--\\nit was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.\\nHad not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?\"  No, she had\\nheard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put\\nit away.\\n\\n\"If we were in the other room,\" said Emma, \"if I had my writing-desk,\\nI am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.--\\nDo not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you\\none day?\"\\n\\n\"He chose to say he was employed\"--\\n\\n\"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner\\nto convince Mr. Knightley.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley dryly, \"writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,\\nhe will, of course, put forth his best.\"\\n\\nDinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,\\nwas ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request\\nto be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\\n\\n\"Must I go first?  I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know\\nwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected\\nthat it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered\\nbut in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,\\nand that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air\\nof greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.\\n\\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition\\nand the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue\\'s end--\\nbut she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word\\nthat should hurt Jane Fairfax\\'s feelings; and they followed\\nthe other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance\\nof good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--\\nwith so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton\\nengross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were\\nobliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.\\nMrs. Elton left them no choice.  If Jane repressed her for a\\nlittle time, she soon began again; and though much that passed\\nbetween them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton\\'s side,\\nthere was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:\\nThe post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,\\nwere long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must\\nbe at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had\\nyet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of\\nMrs. Elton\\'s meditated activity.\\n\\n\"Here is April come!\" said she, \"I get quite anxious about you.\\nJune will soon be here.\"\\n\\n\"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\\nforward to the summer in general.\"\\n\\n\"But have you really heard of nothing?\"\\n\\n\"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware\\nof the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\"\\n\\n\"I not aware!\" said Jane, shaking her head; \"dear Mrs. Elton,\\nwho can have thought of it as I have done?\"\\n\\n\"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.  You do not\\nknow how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations.\\nI saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.\\nA cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity\\nof applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,\\nfor she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom!\\nYou may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom\\nMrs. Bragge\\'s is the one I would most wish to see you in.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\"\\nsaid Jane.  \"I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will\\nwant it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.\\nBut I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries\\nat present.\"\\n\\n\"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.  You are afraid of giving\\nme trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can\\nhardly be more interested about you than I am.  I shall write\\nto Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict\\ncharge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject\\nto her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving\\nany body trouble.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,\\nand June, or say even July, is very near, with such business\\nto accomplish before us.  Your inexperience really amuses me!\\nA situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,\\nis no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment\\'s notice;\\nindeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, ma\\'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\\nWhen I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid\\nof being long unemployed.  There are places in town, offices,\\nwhere inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--\\nnot quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, human flesh!  You quite shock me; if you mean a fling\\nat the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather\\na friend to the abolition.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\" replied Jane;\\n\"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;\\nwidely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;\\nbut as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where\\nit lies.  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,\\nand that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon\\nmeeting with something that would do.\"\\n\\n\"Something that would do!\" repeated Mrs. Elton.  \"Aye, _that_ may\\nsuit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature\\nyou are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\\nwith any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,\\nin a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command\\nthe elegancies of life.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,\\nI think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\\nA gentleman\\'s family is all that I should condition for.\"\\n\\n\"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I\\nshall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will\\nbe quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right\\nto move in the first circle.  Your musical knowledge alone would\\nentitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,\\nand mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--\\nif you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;\\nbut you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,\\neven without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must\\nand shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before\\nthe Campbells or I have any rest.\"\\n\\n\"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort\\nof such a situation together,\" said Jane, \"they are pretty sure\\nto be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing\\nto be attempted at present for me.  I am exceedingly obliged to you,\\nMrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am\\nquite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.\\nFor two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,\" replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\\n\"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends\\nto watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\"\\n\\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing\\ntill Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change\\nof object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\\n\\n\"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\\nhe is;--I assure you I like him excessively.  I admire all that quaint,\\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\\nmodern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,\\nI wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure\\nyou I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.\\nI fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.\\nHow do you like it?--Selina\\'s choice--handsome, I think, but I\\ndo not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest\\ndislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.\\nI must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.\\nA bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste\\nis all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely\\npreferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;\\nfew people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery\\nare every thing.  I have some notion of putting such a trimming\\nas this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will\\nlook well?\"\\n\\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room\\nwhen Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.  He had returned\\nto a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.\\nHe had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--\\nbut there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see\\nhim now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley\\nonly was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent\\nhis evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,\\nshould set off again, and walk half a mile to another man\\'s house,\\nfor the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing\\nhis day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,\\nwas a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A man who had been in motion\\nsince eight o\\'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,\\nwho had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been\\nin more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,\\nto quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,\\nand on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into\\nthe world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\\nback his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley\\nlooked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,\\n\"I could not have believed it even of _him_.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation\\nhe was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all\\nthe right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere\\nfrom home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;\\nand having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,\\nconvincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants\\nhad been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,\\nwas proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally\\naddressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being\\nhighly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,\\nit was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,\\nand had taken the liberty of opening it.\\n\\n\"Read it, read it,\" said he, \"it will give you pleasure;\\nonly a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\"\\n\\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling\\nand talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,\\nbut very audible to every body.\\n\\n\"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do\\nyou say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,\\ndid not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would\\nnot believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;\\nfor _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is\\nto be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.\\nAs to her illness, all nothing of course.  But it is an excellent\\nthing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.  They will stay\\na good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.\\nThis is precisely what I wanted.  Well, pretty good news, is not it?\\nHave you finished it?  Has Emma read it all?  Put it up, put it up;\\nwe will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not\\ndo now.  I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a\\ncommon way.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.\\nHer looks and words had nothing to restrain them.  She was happy,\\nshe knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.\\nHer congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak\\nso fluently.  _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,\\nand trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she\\nrather thought was considerable.\\n\\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\\n\\nIt was well that he took every body\\'s joy for granted, or he\\nmight not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley\\nparticularly delighted.  They were the first entitled,\\nafter Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would\\nhave proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation\\nwith John Knightley, that it would have been too positive\\nan interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and\\nher attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\n\"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\"\\nsaid Mr. Weston.\\n\\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\\nher by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\\n\\n\"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\" he continued--\\n\"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.\\nI am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we\\nshall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\\nHe is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it\\nin a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,\\nand seeing my son\\'s hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed\\nto me--it was to Mrs. Weston.  She is his principal correspondent,\\nI assure you.  I hardly ever get a letter.\"\\n\\n\"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  Oh!  Mr. Weston--\\n(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous\\nprecedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow\\nyour example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,\\nwe married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,\\nI could not have believed it of you!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, we men are sad fellows.  You must take care of yourself,\\nMrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in\\na hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all\\ncoming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill\\'s account--she has\\nnot been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--\\nso they are all to move southward without loss of time.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.  Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.\\na considerable journey.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther\\nthan from Maple Grove to London.  But what is distance, Mr. Weston,\\nto people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,\\nMr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.  You will hardly believe me--\\nbut twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again\\nwith four horses.\"\\n\\n\"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\" said Mr. Weston, \"is, that\\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together.  In Frank\\'s last letter she complained,\\nhe said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncle\\'s! This, you know, speaks a great degree\\nof weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she\\nmeans to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.\\nCertainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,\\nMrs. Elton.  You must grant me that.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part\\nof my own sex.  I do indeed.  I give you notice--You will find me\\na formidable antagonist on that point.  I always stand up for women--\\nand I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect\\nto sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill\\'s\\nmaking incredible exertions to avoid it.  Selina says it is quite\\nhorror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.\\nShe always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.\\nDoes Mrs. Churchill do the same?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other\\nfine lady ever did.  Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady\\nin the land for\"--\\n\\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.  Selina is no fine lady,\\nI assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea.\"\\n\\n\"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is\\nas thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.\"\\n\\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister\\nwas _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence\\nof it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,\\nwhen Mr. Weston went on.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--\\nbut this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,\\nand therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of\\nhealth now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been.\\nI would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much\\nfaith in Mrs. Churchill\\'s illness.\"\\n\\n\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,\\nor to Clifton?\"  \"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too\\ncold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.\\nShe has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever\\nwas before, and she begins to want change.  It is a retired place.\\nA fine place, but very retired.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.  Nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than Maple Grove.  Such an immense plantation all round it!\\nYou seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--\\nAnd Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina\\nto enjoy that sort of seclusion.  Or, perhaps she may not have\\nresources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.\\nI always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel\\nvery thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent\\nof society.\"\\n\\n\"Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"So I remember to have heard.  He will find an _addition_ to the\\nsociety of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume\\nto call myself an addition.  But perhaps he may never have heard\\nof there being such a creature in the world.\"\\n\\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,\\nand Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\\n\\n\"My dear madam!  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a\\nthing possible.  Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nletters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\\n\\n\"When Frank left us,\" continued he, \"it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again, which makes this day\\'s news doubly welcome.\\nIt has been completely unexpected.  That is, _I_ always had a strong\\npersuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something\\nfavourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.  He and Mrs. Weston\\nwere both dreadfully desponding.  `How could he contrive to come?\\nAnd how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare\\nhim again?\\' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen\\nin our favour; and so it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton,\\nin the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,\\nthey are sure to mend the next.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used\\nto say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,\\nwhen, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all\\nthe rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,\\nand exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before\\nHymen\\'s saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have\\nbeen at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!\\nThe carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,\\nI remember, he came to me quite in despair.\"\\n\\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on.\\n\\n\"You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\\nis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place\\nthan Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the\\nagreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--\\nprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen\\nfor it:  days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,\\nalways inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.  When he\\nwas here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal\\nof wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,\\nand we could not do half that we intended.  Now will be the time.\\nThis will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,\\nwhether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant\\nexpectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,\\nand at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having\\nhim actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you\\nwill be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.\\nHe is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.\\nMrs. Weston\\'s partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,\\nmost gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him.\"\\n\\n\"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my\\nopinion will be decidedly in his favour.  I have heard so much\\nin praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair\\nto observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,\\nand are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice\\nthat as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston was musing.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said he presently, \"I have not been severe upon poor\\nMrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;\\nbut there are some traits in her character which make it difficult\\nfor me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.\\nYou cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,\\nnor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,\\nthe whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.\\nFrank\\'s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.\\nMr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife\\'s:\\nhis is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would\\nharm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;\\nbut her pride is arrogance and insolence!  And what inclines one less\\nto bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody\\nwhen he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever\\nsince her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill\\'d them\\nall in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is\\nan upstart.\"\\n\\n\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite\\na horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust\\nto people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood\\nwho are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs\\nthey give themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me\\nthink of them directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately\\nsettled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving\\nthemselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old\\nestablished families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can\\nhave lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.\\nThey came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,\\nyou know, Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham.\\nI always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing\\nmore is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things\\nI assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently\\nthink themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens\\nto be one of their nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad.\\nMr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,\\nand whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am\\nalmost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before\\nhis death.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,\\nhaving said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of\\nwalking away.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse\\nto cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,\\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,\\nwhich nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself\\nin a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.\\nHe was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\\n\\n\"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about\\nthe boys; but you have your sister\\'s letter, and every thing is\\ndown at full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much\\nmore concise than her\\'s, and probably not much in the same spirit;\\nall that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,\\nand do not physic them.\"\\n\\n\"I rather hope to satisfy you both,\" said Emma, \"for I shall do all\\nin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;\\nand happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\"\\n\\n\"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\"\\n\\n\"That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--\\nor even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements\\ncontinue to increase as much as they have done lately.\"\\n\\n\"Increase!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made\\na great difference in your way of life.\"\\n\\n\"Difference!  No indeed I am not.\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\\nthan you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come\\ndown for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--\\nWhen did it happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood\\nis increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,\\nevery letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;\\ndinners at Mr. Cole\\'s, or balls at the Crown.  The difference\\nwhich Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\\nthat Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are,\\nI only beg you to send them home.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence.\\nLet them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Emma, \"you amuse me!  I should like to know\\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\\nto attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--\\nwhat have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball\\ntalked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at\\nMr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of\\nyour friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.\\nBut you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom\\nI am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a\\nseries of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear\\nlittle boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,\\nI do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,\\nwho is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--\\nand who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling\\nhis accounts.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded\\nwithout difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton\\'s beginning to talk to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME III\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.\\nShe was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at\\nall apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment\\nhad really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--\\nbut if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love\\nof the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment\\nwhich he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation\\nof two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils\\nbefore her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.\\nShe did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,\\nand it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\\n\\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!\\nand yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.\\nShe felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,\\nan event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.\\n\\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill\\'s\\nfeelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had\\nbeen imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.  He rode\\ndown for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came\\nfrom Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all\\nher quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,\\nand how she must act.  They met with the utmost friendliness.\\nThere could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.\\nBut she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\\nhad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.\\nShe watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he\\nhad been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,\\nhad produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\\n\\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:\\nand he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that\\nshe read his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits\\nwere evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.\\nLively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;\\nbut what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a\\nquarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.\\n\"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--\\nhe had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he\\nhad the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,\\nand much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\"\\nShe had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his\\nagitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;\\nand she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her\\nreturning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself\\nwith her long.\\n\\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\\nHe was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.\\nHis aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account\\nat Randall\\'s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,\\nit was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill\\'s removal to London had\\nbeen of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.\\nThat she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself\\nconvinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could\\nnot doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state\\nof health than she had been half a year ago.  He did not believe it\\nto proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,\\nor at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;\\nbut he could not be prevailed on, by all his father\\'s doubts, to say\\nthat her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong\\nas ever.\\n\\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could\\nnot endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation\\nand suffering; and by the ten days\\' end, her nephew\\'s letter to\\nRandalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove\\nimmediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended\\nto the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise\\na fancy for the place.  A ready-furnished house in a favourite\\nspot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.\\n\\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two\\nmonths before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--\\nfor the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now\\nhe wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,\\nalmost as often as he could even wish.\\n\\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.\\nShe hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.\\n\\nMr. Weston\\'s own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted.\\nIt was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would\\nbe really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles\\nto a young man?--An hour\\'s ride.  He would be always coming over.\\nThe difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough\\nto make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing\\nhim never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen\\nto Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able\\nto get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.\\nThere was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be\\nat Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.\\nBetter than nearer!\\n\\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--\\nthe ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had\\nbeen soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now, however,\\nit was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon\\nafter the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,\\nto say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,\\nand that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four\\nhours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\\n\\nMr. Weston\\'s ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows\\nstood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil\\nto him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates\\nwas engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,\\nand he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear\\nlittle John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear\\nEmma were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.  The day approached,\\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,\\nFrank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\\nbefore dinner, and every thing was safe.\\n\\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.\\nThe room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better\\nthan a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very\\nearnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible\\nafter themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the\\npropriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,\\nthat she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet\\ninterval in the young man\\'s company.  She was to convey Harriet,\\nand they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just\\nsufficiently before them.\\n\\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though\\nhe did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have\\na delightful evening.  They all walked about together, to see\\nthat every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes\\nwere joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma\\ncould not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.\\n\"So unreasonably early!\" she was going to exclaim; but she presently\\nfound that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,\\nby particular desire, to help Mr. Weston\\'s judgment; and they were\\nso very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been\\nentreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,\\non the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might\\nsoon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.\\n\\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\\nMr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and\\nintimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,\\nwas not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.\\nShe liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness\\nwould have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,\\nbut not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--\\nShe could fancy such a man.  The whole party walked about,\\nand looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,\\nformed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_,\\na fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\\n\\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston\\'s fault that the number\\nof privy councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped\\nat Mrs. Bates\\'s door to offer the use of their carriage,\\nbut the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.\\n\\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going\\nto the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--\\nimpatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was spoken of.  \"I think she must be here soon,\" said he.\\n\"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much\\nof her.  It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\"\\n\\nA carriage was heard.  He was on the move immediately;\\nbut coming back, said,\\n\\n\"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen\\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton.  I have no business to put myself forward.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.\\n\\n\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about.\\n\"We thought you were to bring them.\"\\n\\nThe mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now.\\nEmma longed to know what Frank\\'s first opinion of Mrs. Elton\\nmight be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,\\nand her smiles of graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying\\nhimself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,\\nafter the introduction had passed.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\\n\"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:\\n\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston\\nwas following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her\\nopinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young\\nman himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out\\nof hearing.\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told\\nyou I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am\\nextremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment.\\nI think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely\\nwhat I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least\\nconceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--\\nquite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.\\nNeither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we\\nused sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost\\nto a fault, bore with them much better.\"\\n\\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston\\'s attention was chained;\\nbut when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were\\nladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must\\nhurry away.\\n\\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  \"I have no doubt of its being\\nour carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are\\nso extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--\\nWhat a pleasure it is to send one\\'s carriage for a friend!--\\nI understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it\\nwill be quite unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always\\ntake care of _them_.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,\\nwalked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much\\nher duty as Mrs. Weston\\'s to receive them.  Her gestures and\\nmovements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;\\nbut her words, every body\\'s words, were soon lost under the\\nincessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not\\nfinished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted\\ninto the circle at the fire.  As the door opened she was heard,\\n\\n\"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify.\\nI do not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--\\nWell!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant\\nindeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.\\nNothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--\\nJane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston,\\nyou must really have had Aladdin\\'s lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes\\nwould not know her own room again.  I saw her as I came in;\\nshe was standing in the entrance.  `Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,\\' said I--\\nbut I had not time for more.\"  She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\\n\"Very well, I thank you, ma\\'am. I hope you are quite well.\\nVery happy to hear it.  So afraid you might have a headache!--\\nseeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.\\nDelighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged\\nto you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I quite ready.\\nDid not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable carriage.--\\nOh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.\\nMrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--\\nBut two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.\\nI said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma\\'am--.\\'  Thank you, my mother\\nis remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s. I made her take\\nher shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\\nMrs. Dixon\\'s wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\\nBought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon\\'s choice.  There were\\nthree others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.\\nColonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,\\nare you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,\\nbut I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--\\nand there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his\\nextreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you\\nmy mother\\'s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet\\nnever came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.\\nDoes not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--\\nAh! here\\'s Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--\\nVery well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--\\nSuch a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma\\nmost complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,\\nyou do look--how do you like Jane\\'s hair?--You are a judge.--\\nShe did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--\\nNo hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--\\nand Mrs. Hughes.  Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for\\na moment.--How do you do?  How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.\\nThis is delightful, is not it?--Where\\'s dear Mr. Richard?--\\nOh! there he is.  Don\\'t disturb him.  Much better employed talking\\nto the young ladies.  How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the\\nother day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--\\nand good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host\\nof friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do\\nyou all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.  Never better.--\\nDon\\'t I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the\\nworthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about\\namong such friends!  And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.\\nNo coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea\\nif you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\\nEvery thing so good!\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\\ndiscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\\nway behind her.--He was thoughtful.  Whether he were overhearing too,\\nshe could not determine.  After a good many compliments to Jane\\non her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,\\nMrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--\\nand it was, \"How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--\\nHow has Wright done my hair?\"--with many other relative questions,\\nall answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,\\n\"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such\\nan occasion as this, when every body\\'s eyes are so much upon me,\\nand in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving\\nthis ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior\\nto others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--\\nSo Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see\\nif our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\\nI like him very well.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could\\nnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want\\nto hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,\\ntill another suspension brought Mrs. Elton\\'s tones again distinctly\\nforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\\n\\n\"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--\\nI was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be\\nimpatient for tidings of us.\"\\n\\n\"Jane!\"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--\\n\"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"How do you like Mrs. Elton?\" said Emma in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"You are ungrateful.\"\\n\\n\"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\"  Then changing from a frown to\\na smile--\"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--\\nWhere is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\"\\n\\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.\\nHe walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,\\nwhich must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston\\nthat Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would\\nexpect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma\\nthat distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.\\n\\n\"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\" said Mr. Weston.\\n\"She will think Frank ought to ask her.\"\\n\\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;\\nand boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\\nperfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\\nwanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\\nwas to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--\\nMr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.\\nIt was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had\\nundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;\\nfor though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could\\nnot lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son\\'s superior.--\\nIn spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,\\ndelighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,\\nand to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--\\nShe was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\\'s not dancing than by any\\nthing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not\\nto be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,\\nand fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest\\nin the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--\\nHe could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,\\nthan where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,\\namong the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,\\nwas such as Emma felt must draw every body\\'s eyes; and, excepting her\\nown partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men\\nwho could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike\\na manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he\\nbut take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him\\nto smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could\\nlove a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--\\nHe seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,\\nshe did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between\\nher and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,\\nthan lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,\\nwas indubitable.\\n\\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant\\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body\\nseemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,\\nwhich is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,\\nwas repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.\\nOf very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive\\nthan such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma\\nthought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,\\nand Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--\\nand so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there\\ncould be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma\\'s wonder\\nlessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.\\nHe would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:\\nshe was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to\\nescape into the card-room.\\n\\nEscape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room\\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about\\nin front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution\\nof maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly\\nbefore Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--\\nEmma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way\\nup from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,\\nand by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was\\nhalf-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she\\nwould no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,\\nthat she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\\nplace between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,\\nwho was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,\\nbut even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,\\ngentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, \"Do not\\nyou dance, Mr. Elton?\" to which his prompt reply was, \"Most readily,\\nMrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.\\nI am no dancer.\"\\n\\n\"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\" said he, \"I shall have great pleasure,\\nI am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man,\\nand that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great\\npleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\"\\n\"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--\\nand if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,\\nMrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most happy\\nto do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what\\nsurprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.\\nThis was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--\\nShe looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a\\nlittle distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,\\nwhile smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.\\n\\nShe would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared\\nher face might be as hot.\\n\\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley\\nleading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,\\nseldom more delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure\\nand gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be\\nthanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance\\nsaid much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.\\n\\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,\\nextremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,\\nif it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for\\nthe very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction\\nwhich her happy features announced.  It was not thrown away on her,\\nshe bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,\\nand was in a continual course of smiles.\\n\\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)\\nvery foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,\\nthough growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings,\\nby observing audibly to her partner,\\n\\n\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,\\nI declare.\"\\n\\nSupper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be\\nheard from that moment, without interruption, till her being\\nseated at table and taking up her spoon.\\n\\n\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.\\nMrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid\\nthere will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has\\nbeen done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,\\nindeed you must.  Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!\\nHow well you put it on!--so gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!--\\nYes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama\\nto bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without\\nsaying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,\\nhad a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,\\nand backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples\\nand wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some of her throws:\\nand she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,\\nand who were your partners.  `Oh!\\' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane;\\nI left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you\\nall about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\\nI do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.\\'\\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would\\nnot rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,\\nJane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand\\na little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant\\nshe looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.\\nQuite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.\\nTwo steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is\\nbut one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!\\nI was convinced there were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any\\nthing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\\nyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--\\nThe baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;\\nbut there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus\\nbrought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the\\nasparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.  Now there\\nis nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--\\nso she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it\\nto any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nwho would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!\\nI am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such\\nelegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--\\nWell, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that\\nJane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\\nOh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--\\nonly it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct\\nin this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever\\nrecollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me!\\nI should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I\\ncannot help beginning.\"\\n\\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till\\nafter supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,\\nher eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.\\nHe was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton\\'s conduct; it had been\\nunpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton\\'s looks also received the due\\nshare of censure.\\n\\n\"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\" said he.  \"Emma, why\\nis it that they are your enemies?\"\\n\\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving\\nno answer, added, \"_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,\\nwhatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;\\nbut confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" replied Emma, \"and they cannot forgive me.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,\\nand he only said,\\n\\n\"I shall not scold you.  I leave you to your own reflections.\"\\n\\n\"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever\\ntell me I am wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads\\nyou wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.\"\\n\\n\"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.\\nThere is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I\\ndid not:  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.\\nIt was through a series of strange blunders!\"\\n\\n\"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice\\nto say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\\nhimself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton\\nis totally without.  An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--\\ninfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such\\na woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle\\nof Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\\n\\n\"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--\\nCome Emma, set your companions the example.  Every body is lazy!\\nEvery body is asleep!\"\\n\\n\"I am ready,\" said Emma, \"whenever I am wanted.\"\\n\\n\"Whom are you going to dance with?\" asked Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, \"With you, if you will\\nask me.\"\\n\\n\"Will you?\" said he, offering his hand.\\n\\n\"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we\\nare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\"\\n\\n\"Brother and sister! no, indeed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\\npleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,\\nwhich she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was\\nextremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\\nthe Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\\nmuch alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,\\nwas peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for\\na few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been\\nthe occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked\\nforward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet\\'s infatuation.--\\nFrom Harriet\\'s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they\\nquitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes\\nwere suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton\\nwas not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever\\nwas over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being\\nquickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil\\nfeelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed\\nneglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,\\nFrank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not\\nwanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!\\n\\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told\\nher that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping\\nat Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.\\nShe did not regret it.\\n\\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\\nto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\nfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\\nwhen the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered\\nwhom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,\\nwith Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment\\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\\nHarriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--\\nThe iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--\\nthey were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking\\ninto a chair fainted away.\\n\\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\\nand surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,\\nbut the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma\\nacquainted with the whole.\\n\\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,\\nand taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public\\nenough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile\\nbeyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms\\non each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;\\nand when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,\\nthey had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,\\non a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.\\nA child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,\\nexcessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet\\nto follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,\\nand made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\\nBut poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered very much\\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--\\nand in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged\\nto remain.\\n\\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been\\nmore courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack\\ncould not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a\\ndozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,\\nand impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and\\nmore frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out\\nher purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,\\nor to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,\\nand was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,\\nand she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,\\ndemanding more.\\n\\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling\\nand conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate\\nchance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him\\nto her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness\\nof the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his\\nhorses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--\\nand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before\\nof Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had\\nbeen obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:\\nhe was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,\\nwas unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.\\nThe terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet\\nwas then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;\\nand Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,\\nhad just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits\\nwere quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:\\nhe had thought of no other place.\\n\\nThis was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and\\nof Harriet\\'s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--\\nHe dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays\\nleft him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give\\nassurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there\\nbeing such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,\\nhe set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter\\nfor her friend and herself.\\n\\nSuch an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young\\nwoman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting\\ncertain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.\\nSo Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,\\ncould even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their\\nappearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling\\nthat circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting\\nto each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,\\nbe on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such\\na groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.\\n\\nIt was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;\\nno rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened\\nto the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very\\nperson was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly\\nwas very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable\\nstate of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.\\nHe was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,\\nshe just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if\\nevery thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.\\nIt was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly\\nrecommending each to the other.\\n\\nIn the few minutes\\' conversation which she had yet had with him,\\nwhile Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\\nher naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet\\'s\\nown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation\\nat the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.\\nEvery thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled\\nnor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.\\nNo, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm\\nin a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish.\\nBeyond it she would on no account proceed.\\n\\nEmma\\'s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge\\nof what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:\\nbut she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.  Within half\\nan hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event\\nto engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all\\nthe youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of\\nfrightful news.  The last night\\'s ball seemed lost in the gipsies.\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,\\nwould scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go\\nbeyond the shrubbery again.  It was some comfort to him that many\\ninquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours\\nknew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,\\nwere coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure\\nof returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--\\nwhich, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.\\nShe had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such\\na man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not\\ninvent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\\n\\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry.  The young ladies of Highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole\\nhistory dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma\\nand her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,\\nand Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of\\nHarriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right\\nif she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came\\none morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after\\nsitting down and hesitating, thus began:\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I\\nshould like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,\\nyou know, it will be over.\"\\n\\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.\\nThere was a seriousness in Harriet\\'s manner which prepared her,\\nquite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.\\n\\n\"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\" she continued,\\n\"to have no reserves with you on this subject.  As I am happily\\nquite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you\\nshould have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say\\nmore than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way\\nas I have done, and I dare say you understand me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Emma, \"I hope I do.\"\\n\\n\"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . .\"\\ncried Harriet, warmly.  \"It seems like madness!  I can see nothing\\nat all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet\\nhim or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--\\nand indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do\\nnot envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,\\nas I have done:  she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,\\nbut I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget\\nher look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nI wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\\nit will not give me another moment\\'s pang:  and to convince you\\nthat I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I\\nought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--\\nI know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I\\nwill destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it\\nin your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.\\nCannot you guess what this parcel holds?\" said she, with a conscious look.\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have\\nvalued very much.\"\\n\\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top.  Her curiosity was greatly excited.\\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.\\nWithin abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\\nwhich Harriet opened:  it was well lined with the softest cotton;\\nbut, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Harriet, \"you _must_ recollect.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!  I should not have thought it possible you could forget\\nwhat passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very\\nlast times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I\\nhad my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--\\nI think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger\\nwith your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--\\nBut, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired\\nme to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;\\nbut it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept\\nplaying some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.\\nAnd so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--\\nso I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then\\nas a great treat.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Harriet!\" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\\nand jumping up, \"you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\\nRemember it?  Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving\\nthis relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting\\nthe finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\\nabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in\\nmy pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a\\ncontinual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--\\ngo on--what else?\"\\n\\n\"And had you really some at hand yourself?  I am sure I never\\nsuspected it, you did it so naturally.\"\\n\\n\"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\"\\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement.  And secretly she added to herself,\\n\"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton\\na piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!\\nI never was equal to this.\"\\n\\n\"Here,\" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \"here is\\nsomething still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable,\\nbecause this is what did really once belong to him, which the\\ncourt-plaister never did.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end\\nof an old pencil,--the part without any lead.\\n\\n\"This was really his,\" said Harriet.--\"Do not you remember\\none morning?--no, I dare say you do not.  But one morning--I forget\\nexactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before\\n_that_ _evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;\\nit was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him\\nsomething about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;\\nbut when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he\\nsoon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,\\nand this was left upon the table as good for nothing.  But I kept\\nmy eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never\\nparted with it again from that moment.\"\\n\\n\"I do remember it,\" cried Emma; \"I perfectly remember it.--\\nTalking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\\nliked it, and Mr. Elton\\'s seeming resolved to learn to like it too.\\nI perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,\\nwas not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!  I do not know.  I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,\\nbut I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,\\nmuch about where I am now.\"--\\n\\n\"Well, go on.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that\\'s all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--\\nexcept that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,\\nand I wish you to see me do it.\"\\n\\n\"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness\\nin treasuring up these things?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish\\nI could forget as easily as I can burn them.  It was very wrong\\nof me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.\\nI knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.\"\\n\\n\"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have\\nnot a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister\\nmight be useful.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be happier to burn it,\" replied Harriet.  \"It has\\na disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--\\nThere it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\"\\n\\n\"And when,\" thought Emma, \"will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\"\\n\\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\\nalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\\n_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet\\'s.--About a\\nfortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,\\nand quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,\\nwhich made the information she received more valuable.\\nShe merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet,\\nwhenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought\\nno more of it, till after a minute\\'s silence she heard Harriet\\nsay in a very serious tone, \"I shall never marry.\"\\n\\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\\nmoment\\'s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\\n\\n\"Never marry!--This is a new resolution.\"\\n\\n\"It is one that I shall never change, however.\"\\n\\nAfter another short hesitation, \"I hope it does not proceed from--\\nI hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton indeed!\" cried Harriet indignantly.--\"Oh! no\"--and Emma\\ncould just catch the words, \"so superior to Mr. Elton!\"\\n\\nShe then took a longer time for consideration.  Should she proceed\\nno farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--\\nPerhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;\\nor perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive\\nHarriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing\\nlike such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent\\ndiscussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--\\nShe believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,\\nall that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best.\\nShe had previously determined how far she would proceed,\\non any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,\\nto have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--\\nShe was decided, and thus spoke--\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.\\nYour resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,\\nresults from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,\\nwould be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.\\nIs not it so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\\nIndeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him\\nat a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all\\nthe rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,\\nwhich are so proper, in me especially.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.  The service he rendered\\nyou was enough to warm your heart.\"\\n\\n\"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--\\nThe very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--\\nwhen I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.\\nSuch a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery\\nto perfect happiness!\"\\n\\n\"It is very natural.  It is natural, and it is honourable.--\\nYes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--\\nBut that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.\\nI do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any\\nmeans engage for its being returned.  Consider what you are about.\\nPerhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:\\nat any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded\\nof his liking you.  Be observant of him.  Let his behaviour be the\\nguide of your sensations.  I give you this caution now, because I\\nshall never speak to you again on the subject.  I am determined\\nagainst all interference.  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.\\nLet no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;\\nwe will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there\\ndo seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;\\nbut yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have\\nbeen matches of greater disparity.  But take care of yourself.\\nI would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,\\nbe assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste\\nwhich I shall always know how to value.\"\\n\\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.\\nEmma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing\\nfor her friend.  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--\\nand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened\\nupon Hartfield.  To Highbury in general it brought no material change.\\nThe Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,\\nand of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax\\nwas still at her grandmother\\'s; and as the return of the Campbells\\nfrom Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,\\nfixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,\\nprovided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton\\'s activity\\nin her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\\nsituation against her will.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\\ntaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\\nhim more.  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his\\npursuit of Emma.  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\\nEvery thing declared it; his own attentions, his father\\'s hints,\\nhis mother-in-law\\'s guarded silence; it was all in unison;\\nwords, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.\\nBut while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him\\nover to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination\\nto trifle with Jane Fairfax.  He could not understand it; but there\\nwere symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--\\nsymptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,\\nhe could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,\\nhowever he might wish to escape any of Emma\\'s errors of imagination.\\n_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.  He was dining\\nwith the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons\\'; and he had\\nseen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,\\nfrom the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.\\nWhen he was again in their company, he could not help remembering\\nwhat he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it\\nwere like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\\n\\n\"Myself creating what I saw,\"\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something\\nof private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank\\nChurchill and Jane.\\n\\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,\\nto spend his evening at Hartfield.  Emma and Harriet were going\\nto walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a\\nlarger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their\\nexercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\nand their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.\\nThey all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it\\nwas exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,\\npressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.  The Randalls\\nparty agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech\\nfrom Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it\\npossible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse\\'s most obliging invitation.\\n\\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\\nThe gentlemen spoke of his horse.\\n\\n\"By the bye,\" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,\\n\"what became of Mr. Perry\\'s plan of setting up his carriage?\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \"I did not know that he\\never had any such plan.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I had it from you.  You wrote me word of it three months ago.\"\\n\\n\"Me! impossible!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you did.  I remember it perfectly.  You mentioned it as\\nwhat was certainly to be very soon.  Mrs. Perry had told somebody,\\nand was extremely happy about it.  It was owing to _her_ persuasion,\\nas she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal\\nof harm.  You must remember it now?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\"\\n\\n\"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must\\nhave dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,\\nyou walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find\\nyourself at home.\"\\n\\n\"What is this?--What is this?\" cried Mr. Weston, \"about Perry\\nand a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?\\nI am glad he can afford it.  You had it from himself, had you?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied his son, laughing, \"I seem to have had it\\nfrom nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nhaving mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,\\nwith all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard\\na syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am\\na great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--\\nand when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin\\ndreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.\"\\n\\n\"It is odd though,\" observed his father, \"that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe.  Perry\\'s setting up his carriage!\\nand his wife\\'s persuading him to it, out of care for his health--\\njust what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;\\nonly a little premature.  What an air of probability sometimes\\nruns through a dream!  And at others, what a heap of absurdities\\nit is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in\\nyour thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,\\nI think?\"\\n\\nEmma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests\\nto prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach\\nof Mr. Weston\\'s hint.\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth,\" cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes, \"if I must speak on this subject,\\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not\\nmean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes\\nthe oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,\\nI must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;\\nfor Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles\\nknew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,\\nknown to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.\\nMrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came\\nto my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she\\nhad prevailed.  Jane, don\\'t you remember grandmama\\'s telling us\\nof it when we got home?  I forget where we had been walking to--\\nvery likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.\\nMrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do\\nnot know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not\\nto go beyond:  and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it\\nto a soul that I know of.  At the same time, I will not positively\\nanswer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do\\nsometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.  I am a talker,\\nyou know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing\\nescape me which I should not.  I am not like Jane; I wish I were.\\nI will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world.\\nWhere is she?--Oh! just behind.  Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry\\'s coming.--\\nExtraordinary dream, indeed!\"\\n\\nThey were entering the hall.  Mr. Knightley\\'s eyes had preceded\\nMiss Bates\\'s in a glance at Jane.  From Frank Churchill\\'s face,\\nwhere he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,\\nhe had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,\\nand too busy with her shawl.  Mr. Weston had walked in.  The two\\nother gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.  Mr. Knightley\\nsuspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--\\nhe seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--\\nJane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.\\n\\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must\\nbe borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\\nthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\\nand which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\\npersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,\\non which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.\\nTea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse,\" said Frank Churchill, after examining a table\\nbehind him, which he could reach as he sat, \"have your nephews taken\\naway their alphabets--their box of letters?  It used to stand here.\\nWhere is it?  This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought\\nto be treated rather as winter than summer.  We had great amusement\\nwith those letters one morning.  I want to puzzle you again.\"\\n\\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves.  They were rapidly forming\\nwords for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.\\nThe quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for\\nMr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,\\nwhich Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily\\noccupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure\\nof the \"poor little boys,\" or in fondly pointing out, as he took\\nup any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\\n\\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.  She gave\\na slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.\\nFrank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley\\nso placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much\\nas he could, with as little apparent observation.  The word\\nwas discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.  If meant\\nto be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,\\nshe should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,\\nfor it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,\\nand finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.\\nShe was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\\nThe word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,\\nthere was a blush on Jane\\'s cheek which gave it a meaning not\\notherwise ostensible.  Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;\\nbut how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.\\nHow the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been\\nso lain asleep!  He feared there must be some decided involvement.\\nDisingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.\\nThese letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.\\nIt was a child\\'s play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\\nChurchill\\'s part.\\n\\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great\\nalarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.\\nHe saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look\\nsly and demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found\\nit highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it\\nproper to appear to censure; for she said, \"Nonsense! for shame!\"\\nHe heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,\\n\"I will give it to her--shall I?\"--and as clearly heard Emma\\nopposing it with eager laughing warmth.  \"No, no, you must not;\\nyou shall not, indeed.\"\\n\\nIt was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love\\nwithout feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,\\ndirectly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular\\ndegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley\\'s\\nexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize\\nevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was\\nnot long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax\\'s perception\\nseemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal\\nto the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters\\nso arranged.  She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing\\nherself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,\\nand saying only, \"I did not know that proper names were allowed,\"\\npushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked\\nresolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.\\nHer face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned\\ntowards her aunt.\\n\\n\"Aye, very true, my dear,\" cried the latter, though Jane had not\\nspoken a word--\"I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time\\nfor us to be going indeed.  The evening is closing in, and grandmama\\nwill be looking for us.  My dear sir, you are too obliging.\\nWe really must wish you good night.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt\\nhad preconceived.  She was immediately up, and wanting to quit\\nthe table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;\\nand Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously\\npushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.\\nShe was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was\\nlooking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;\\nand how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.\\n\\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full\\nof what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist\\nhis observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--\\nan anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.\\nHe could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to\\npreserve her.  It was his duty.\\n\\n\"Pray, Emma,\" said he, \"may I ask in what lay the great amusement,\\nthe poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?\\nI saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very\\nentertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the\\ntrue explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,\\nshe was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried in evident embarrassment, \"it all meant nothing;\\na mere joke among ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"The joke,\" he replied gravely, \"seemed confined to you\\nand Mr. Churchill.\"\\n\\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would\\nrather busy herself about any thing than speak.  He sat a little\\nwhile in doubt.  A variety of evils crossed his mind.  Interference--\\nfruitless interference.  Emma\\'s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy,\\nseemed to declare her affection engaged.  Yet he would speak.\\nHe owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in\\nan unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter\\nany thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he at last, with earnest kindness, \"do you\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between\\nthe gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\"\\n\\n\"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?  Oh! yes, perfectly.--\\nWhy do you make a doubt of it?\"\\n\\n\"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,\\nor that she admired him?\"\\n\\n\"Never, never!\" she cried with a most open eagerness--\"Never, for\\nthe twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.\\nAnd how could it possibly come into your head?\"\\n\\n\"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--\\ncertain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you amuse me excessively.  I am delighted to find that you\\ncan vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--\\nvery sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will\\nnot do.  There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;\\nand the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some\\npeculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--\\nit is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of\\nnonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,\\nwhich is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or\\nadmiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.\\nThat is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I can _answer_ for its\\nbeing so on his.  I will answer for the gentleman\\'s indifference.\"\\n\\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\\nwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would\\nhave prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars\\nof his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows\\nof a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did\\nnot meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings\\nwere too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated\\ninto an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse\\'s tender\\nhabits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon\\nafterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness\\nand solitude of Donwell Abbey.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and\\nMrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.\\nNo such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores\\nat present.  In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings\\'\\ncoming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report,\\nand the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped\\nmight eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,\\nas that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed.  It was the delay of a great\\ndeal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations\\nmust all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.\\nSo she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced\\nher that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they\\nexplore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?  They could\\ngo there again with them in the autumn.  It was settled that they\\nshould go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been\\nlong generally known:  it had even given the idea of another.\\nEmma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body\\nfound so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more\\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to\\nbe done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior\\nto the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,\\nand picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\\n\\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could\\nnot but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing\\nfrom Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her\\nbrother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,\\nand go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded\\nto it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.  Now, as her\\nobjection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,\\nof which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth\\nbringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof\\nto him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found\\nherself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she\\nwould have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\\nMrs. Elton\\'s party!  Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance\\nof her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity\\nin her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston\\'s temper.\\n\\n\"I am glad you approve of what I have done,\" said he very comfortably.\\n\"But I thought you would.  Such schemes as these are nothing\\nwithout numbers.  One cannot have too large a party.  A large party\\nsecures its own amusement.  And she is a good-natured woman after all.\\nOne could not leave her out.\"\\n\\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\\n\\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\\nwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston\\nas to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw\\nevery thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be\\nonly a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations\\ncould be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.\\nMrs. Elton\\'s resources were inadequate to such an attack.\\n\\n\"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?\" she cried.--\"And such weather\\nfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.\\nWhat are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,\\nand nothing done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had\\nhad a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You had better explore to Donwell,\" replied Mr. Knightley.\\n\"That may be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries.\\nThey are ripening fast.\"\\n\\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh!  I should\\nlike it of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner.\\nDonwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for\\nthe invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have\\nbeen enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.\\nShe promised him again and again to come--much oftener than\\nhe doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,\\nsuch a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.\\n\\n\"You may depend upon me,\" said she.  \"I certainly will come.\\nName your day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring\\nJane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot name a day,\" said he, \"till I have spoken to some others\\nwhom I would wish to meet you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! leave all that to me.  Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am\\nLady Patroness, you know.  It is my party.  I will bring friends\\nwith me.\"\\n\\n\"I hope you will bring Elton,\" said he:  \"but I will not trouble\\nyou to give any other invitations.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! now you are looking very sly.  But consider--you need not be afraid\\nof delegating power to _me_.  I am no young lady on her preferment.\\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised.  It is my party.\\nLeave it all to me.  I will invite your guests.\"\\n\\n\"No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world\\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,\\nand that one is--\"\\n\\n\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\\n\\n\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage\\nsuch matters myself.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are an odd creature!\" she cried, satisfied to have no\\none preferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist, and may say what\\nyou like.  Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--\\nJane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections\\nat all to meeting the Hartfield family.  Don\\'t scruple.  I know\\nyou are attached to them.\"\\n\\n\"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call\\non Miss Bates in my way home.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.\\nIt is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.\\nI shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets\\nhanging on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.\\nNothing can be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another.\\nThere is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are\\nto walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,\\nand sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,\\nit is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.\\nEvery thing as natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?\"\\n\\n\"Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\\nthe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity\\nof gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think\\nis best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating\\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Well--as you please; only don\\'t have a great set out.  And, by the bye,\\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--\\nPray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,\\nor to inspect anything--\"\\n\\n\"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper\\nis extremely clever.\"\\n\\n\"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,\\nand would spurn any body\\'s assistance.\"\\n\\n\"I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come\\non donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.\\nI really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country\\nlife I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have\\never so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut\\nup at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,\\nand in winter there is dirt.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.\\nDonwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.  Come on\\na donkey, however, if you prefer it.  You can borrow Mrs. Cole\\'s.\\nI would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.\"\\n\\n\"That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\\nwarmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--\\nYes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention\\nto me in the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing\\nto please me.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.\\nHe wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors\\nto eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not,\\nunder the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two\\nspent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\\n\\nHe was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid\\nhim for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been\\nat Donwell for two years.  \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,\\nand Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with\\nMrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.\\nHe did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of\\nthe day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,\\nand should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other\\nof his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,\\nand Emma\\'s, and Harriet\\'s going there some very fine morning.\\nHe thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--\\nvery kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not\\nfond of dining out.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\\'s most ready concurrence.\\nThe invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,\\nlike Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular\\ncompliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high\\nexpectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,\\npromised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof\\nof approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--\\nMr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad\\nto see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,\\nand spare no arguments to induce him to come.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party\\nto Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell\\nwas settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather\\nappearing exactly right.\\n\\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse\\nwas safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,\\nto partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most\\ncomfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a\\nfire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,\\nready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise\\nevery body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--\\nMrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,\\nand sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others\\nwere invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.\\n\\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\\nwas satisfied of her father\\'s comfort, she was glad to leave him,\\nand look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with\\nmore particular observation, more exact understanding of a house\\nand grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\\n\\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance\\nwith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,\\nas she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,\\nits suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--\\nits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,\\nof which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,\\nhad scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,\\nwhich neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house\\nwas larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good\\ndeal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,\\nand one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,\\nand it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,\\nuntainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John\\nKnightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.\\nShe had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could\\nraise a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about\\nand indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,\\nand collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,\\nexcepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;\\nand Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet\\nand her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,\\naccepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,\\ncould now be thought or spoken of.--\"The best fruit in England--\\nevery body\\'s favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds\\nand finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one\\'s self--the only way\\nof really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--\\nevery sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--\\nthe others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--\\nwhite wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--\\nabundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to\\nbe renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--\\ngardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--\\nonly too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--\\ncurrants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries\\nthe stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--\\nmust go and sit in the shade.\"\\n\\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only\\nonce by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her\\nson-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--\\nShe had some fears of his horse.\\n\\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\\nto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--\\nA situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton\\nhad received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.\\nIt was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,\\nbut in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was\\nwith a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,\\na lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,\\nfirst circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton\\nwas wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,\\nall was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused\\nto take her friend\\'s negative, though Miss Fairfax continued\\nto assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,\\nrepeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--\\nStill Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence\\nby the morrow\\'s post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing\\nto Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,\\nwith a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--\\n\"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--\\nall the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\"--The pertinacity\\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear.\\n\\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\\navenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\\ndistance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--\\nIt led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\\nwall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,\\nto give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had\\nbeen there.  Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such\\na termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view\\nwhich closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly\\nthe foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank\\nof considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--\\nand at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,\\nrose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river\\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it.\\n\\nIt was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,\\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,\\nwithout being oppressive.\\n\\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;\\nand towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley\\nand Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was\\nglad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned\\nher as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.\\nNow they seemed in pleasant conversation.  There had been a time\\nalso when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot\\nso favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.\\nIt might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\\nand beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,\\nand light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,\\nand found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.\\nHe was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.\\nand Emma received a smile which seemed to say, \"These are my\\nown concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being\\nsuspected of introducing Robert Martin.\"--She did not suspect him.\\nIt was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think\\nof Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade\\nwas most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of\\nthe day.\\n\\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--\\nand they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did\\nnot come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would\\nnot own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could\\nnot be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.\\nHe had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.\\n\"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting\\nover to them.\"--Mrs. Churchill\\'s state, however, as many were ready\\nto remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint\\nher nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston\\nwas at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be\\nby some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--\\nEmma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\\nshe behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\\n\\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more\\nto see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;\\nperhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting\\non the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,\\nand growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken\\nhis little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no\\ndamps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;\\nand his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston\\nmight be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety\\nwhich her spirits seemed to need.\\n\\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse\\'s\\nentertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,\\ncorals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,\\nhad been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;\\nand the kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been\\nexceedingly well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him,\\nand now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other\\nresemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,\\nfor he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking\\nover was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake\\nof a few moments\\' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot\\nof the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,\\ncoming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--\\nLittle expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start\\nat first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.\\n\\n\"Will you be so kind,\" said she, \"when I am missed, as to say\\nthat I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware\\nhow late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we\\nshall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said\\nnothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble\\nand distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.\\nTill they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,\\nwill you have the goodness to say that I am gone?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk\\nto Highbury alone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.  I shall be at home\\nin twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n\"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.\\nLet my father\\'s servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.\\nIt can be round in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--\\nAnd for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have\\nto guard others!\"\\n\\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,\\n\"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.\\nI must order the carriage.  The heat even would be danger.--You are\\nfatigued already.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\"--she answered--\"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort\\nof fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all\\nknow at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.  Mine, I confess,\\nare exhausted.  The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let\\nme have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\"\\n\\nEmma had not another word to oppose.  She saw it all; and entering\\ninto her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,\\nand watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.  Her parting\\nlook was grateful--and her parting words, \"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,\\nthe comfort of being sometimes alone!\"--seemed to burst from\\nan overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual\\nendurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who\\nloved her best.\\n\\n\"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!\" said Emma, as she turned back\\ninto the hall again.  \"I do pity you.  And the more sensibility\\nyou betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you.\"\\n\\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\\naccomplished some views of St. Mark\\'s Place, Venice, when Frank\\nChurchill entered the room.  Emma had not been thinking of him,\\nshe had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.\\nMrs. Weston would be at ease.  The black mare was blameless;\\n_they_ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.\\nHe had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;\\na nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given\\nup every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot\\na ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,\\nhe believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;\\nhe had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid\\nat home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,\\netc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest\\npossible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s fire,\\nlooking very deplorable.\\n\\n\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very\\nill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!\\nYou will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.\\nI met _one_ as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill\\'s\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being\\nout of humour.  Some people were always cross when they were hot.\\nSuch might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating\\nand drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,\\nshe recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance\\nof every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out\\nthe door.\\n\\n\"No--he should not eat.  He was not hungry; it would only make\\nhim hotter.\"  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;\\nand muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned\\nall her attention to her father, saying in secret--\\n\\n\"I am glad I have done being in love with him.  I should not like a\\nman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.  Harriet\\'s sweet\\neasy temper will not mind it.\"\\n\\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\\nback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,\\nlike himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest\\nin their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he\\nshould be so late.  He was not in his best spirits, but seemed\\ntrying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense\\nvery agreeably.  They were looking over views in Swisserland.\\n\\n\"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\" said he.\\n\"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.\\nYou will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour\\nto read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.\"\\n\\n\"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will\\nnever go to Swisserland.  Your uncle and aunt will never allow\\nyou to leave England.\"\\n\\n\"They may be induced to go too.  A warm climate may be prescribed\\nfor her.  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.\\nI assure you I have.  I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,\\nthat I shall soon be abroad.  I ought to travel.  I am tired\\nof doing nothing.  I want a change.  I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--\\nand would leave it to-morrow, if I could.\"\\n\\n\"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.  Cannot you invent\\na few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\"\\n\\n\"_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence!  You are quite mistaken.\\nI do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am\\nthwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all\\na fortunate person.\"\\n\\n\"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.\\nGo and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.\\nAnother slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,\\nwill make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.\"\\n\\n\"No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure.\"\\n\\n\"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.\\nIt is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young\\nman so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?\"\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\"\\n\\n\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross.\"\\n\\n\"Then pray stay at Richmond.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think\\nof you all there without me.\"\\n\\n\"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.\\nChuse your own degree of crossness.  I shall press you no more.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;\\nothers took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress\\nand disturbance on Miss Fairfax\\'s disappearance being explained.\\nThat it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with\\na short final arrangement for the next day\\'s scheme, they parted.\\nFrank Churchill\\'s little inclination to exclude himself increased\\nso much, that his last words to Emma were,\\n\\n\"Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\"\\n\\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from\\nRichmond was to take him back before the following evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,\\nwere in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,\\nofficiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every\\nbody was in good time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates\\nand her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.\\nMrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting\\nbut to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled\\nin expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration\\non first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there\\nwas deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,\\nwhich could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties.\\nThe Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss\\nBates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\\nAnd Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed\\nat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,\\nand be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours\\nthat were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,\\nbetween the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any\\ncold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\\n\\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank\\nChurchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--\\nlooked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without\\nknowing what she said.  While he was so dull, it was no wonder that\\nHarriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\\n\\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\\nEvery distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\\nTo amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\\ncared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,\\nthe admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first\\nand most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,\\nin her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most\\npeople looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English\\nword but flirtation could very well describe.  \"Mr. Frank Churchill\\nand Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.\"  They were laying\\nthemselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off\\nin a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.\\nNot that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;\\nit was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.\\nShe laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him\\nfor his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\\nadmiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\\nback her heart.  She still intended him for her friend.\\n\\n\"How much I am obliged to you,\" said he, \"for telling me to come to-day!--\\nIf it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the\\nhappiness of this party.  I had quite determined to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,\\nexcept that you were too late for the best strawberries.\\nI was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble.\\nYou begged hard to be commanded to come.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say I was cross.  I was fatigued.  The heat overcame me.\"\\n\\n\"It is hotter to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Not to my feelings.  I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\"\\n\\n\"You are comfortable because you are under command.\"\\n\\n\"Your command?--Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your\\nown management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot\\nbe always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your\\nown command rather than mine.\"\\n\\n\"It comes to the same thing.  I can have no self-command without\\na motive.  You order me, whether you speak or not.  And you can\\nbe always with me.  You are always with me.\"\\n\\n\"Dating from three o\\'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence\\ncould not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much\\nout of humour before.\"\\n\\n\"Three o\\'clock yesterday!  That is your date.  I thought I had seen\\nyou first in February.\"\\n\\n\"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--\\nnobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be\\ntalking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\"\\n\\n\"I say nothing of which I am ashamed,\" replied he, with lively impudence.\\n\"I saw you first in February.  Let every body on the Hill hear me if\\nthey can.  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking\\non the other.  I saw you first in February.\"  And then whispering--\\n\"Our companions are excessively stupid.  What shall we do to rouse them?\\nAny nonsense will serve.  They _shall_ talk.  Ladies and gentlemen,\\nI am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)\\nto say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?\"\\n\\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;\\nMrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse\\'s presiding;\\nMr. Knightley\\'s answer was the most distinct.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are\\nall thinking of?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no\"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--\\n\"Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I\\nwould stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather\\nthan what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all.\\nThere are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)\\nwhose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing,\" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,\\n\"which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to\\ninquire into.  Though, perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--\\n_I_ never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\"\\n\\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,\\nin reply,\\n\\n\"Very true, my love, very true.  Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard of--\\nbut some ladies say any thing.  Better pass it off as a joke.\\nEvery body knows what is due to _you_.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do,\" whispered Frank to Emma; \"they are most\\nof them affronted.  I will attack them with more address.\\nLadies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she\\nwaives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,\\nand only requires something very entertaining from each of you,\\nin a general way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she\\nis pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only\\ndemands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose\\nor verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--\\nor three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily\\nat them all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" exclaimed Miss Bates, \"then I need not be uneasy.\\n`Three things very dull indeed.\\'  That will just do for me, you know.\\nI shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open\\nmy mouth, shan\\'t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured\\ndependence on every body\\'s assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\"\\n\\nEmma could not resist.\\n\\n\"Ah! ma\\'am, but there may be a difficulty.  Pardon me--but you\\nwill be limited as to number--only three at once.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could\\nnot anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\\n\\n\"Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to\\nMr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make\\nmyself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing\\nto an old friend.\"\\n\\n\"I like your plan,\" cried Mr. Weston.  \"Agreed, agreed.  I will do\\nmy best.  I am making a conundrum.  How will a conundrum reckon?\"\\n\\n\"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,\" answered his son;--\"but we shall\\nbe indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said Emma, \"it will not reckon low.  A conundrum of\\nMr. Weston\\'s shall clear him and his next neighbour.  Come, sir,\\npray let me hear it.\"\\n\\n\"I doubt its being very clever myself,\" said Mr. Weston.\\n\"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters\\nof the alphabet are there, that express perfection?\"\\n\\n\"What two letters!--express perfection!  I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you will never guess.  You, (to Emma), I am certain, will\\nnever guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\"\\n\\nUnderstanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh\\nat and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem\\nto touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid\\nabout it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,\\n\\n\"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every\\nbody else.  _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\" said Mrs. Elton;\\n\"_I_ really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.\\nI had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not\\nat all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--\\nYou know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things\\nare very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;\\nbut quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring\\nabout the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.\\nI am not one of those who have witty things at every body\\'s service.\\nI do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity\\nin my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak\\nand when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.\\nPass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--\\nnot one of us.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of\\nsneering consciousness; \"_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain\\nMiss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.  An old married man--\\nquite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long\\non one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm.\"\\n\\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\\n\"Happy couple!\" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out\\nof hearing:--\"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as\\nthey did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only\\nknew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--\\nfor as to any real knowledge of a person\\'s disposition that Bath,\\nor any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be\\nno knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,\\namong their own set, just as they always are, that you can form\\nany just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--\\nand will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself\\non a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!\"\\n\\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her\\nown confederates, spoke now.\\n\\n\"Such things do occur, undoubtedly.\"--She was stopped by a cough.\\nFrank Churchill turned towards her to listen.\\n\\n\"You were speaking,\" said he, gravely.  She recovered her voice.\\n\\n\"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them\\nto be very frequent.  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--\\nbut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.  I would\\nbe understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,\\n(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,\\nan oppression for ever.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\\n\\n\"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever\\nI marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.  Will you?\\n(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I\\nshould like any body fixed on by you.  You provide for the family,\\nyou know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.\\nI am in no hurry.  Adopt her, educate her.\"\\n\\n\"And make her like myself.\"\\n\\n\"By all means, if you can.\"\\n\\n\"Very well.  I undertake the commission.  You shall have a charming wife.\"\\n\\n\"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.  I care for nothing else.\\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,\\nI shall come to you for my wife.  Remember.\"\\n\\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every\\nfavourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;\\nwho could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\\n\\n\"Now, ma\\'am,\" said Jane to her aunt, \"shall we join Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"If you please, my dear.  With all my heart.  I am quite ready.\\nI was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.\\nWe shall soon overtake her.  There she is--no, that\\'s somebody else.\\nThat\\'s one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--\\nWell, I declare--\"\\n\\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.\\nMr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young\\nman\\'s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew\\ntired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather\\nwalking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,\\nand quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful\\nviews beneath her.  The appearance of the servants looking out\\nfor them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;\\nand even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,\\nand the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_ carriage first,\\nwere gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was\\nto close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.\\nSuch another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.\\nHe looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\\n\\n\"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:\\na privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still\\nuse it.  I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.\\nHow could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?  How could you be so\\ninsolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--\\nEmma, I had not thought it possible.\"\\n\\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\\n\\n\"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\\nIt was not so very bad.  I dare say she did not understand me.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked\\nof it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--\\nwith what candour and generosity.  I wish you could have heard her\\nhonouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,\\nas she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,\\nwhen her society must be so irksome.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:\\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are\\nmost unfortunately blended in her.\"\\n\\n\"They are blended,\" said he, \"I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\\nover the good.  Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every\\nharmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you\\nfor any liberties of manner.  Were she your equal in situation--\\nbut, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;\\nshe has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live\\nto old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure\\nyour compassion.  It was badly done, indeed!  You, whom she had known\\nfrom an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her\\nnotice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,\\nand the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before\\nher niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly _some_,)\\nwould be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her.--This is not\\npleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;\\nbut I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,\\nand trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice\\nthan you can do now.\"\\n\\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;\\nit was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.\\nHe had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,\\nand her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger\\nagainst herself, mortification, and deep concern.  She had not\\nbeen able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back\\nfor a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken\\nno leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,\\nshe looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;\\nbut it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were\\nin motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,\\nwith what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,\\nand every thing left far behind.  She was vexed beyond what could\\nhave been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.\\nNever had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance\\nin her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this\\nrepresentation there was no denying.  She felt it at her heart.\\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could\\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!\\nAnd how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,\\nof concurrence, of common kindness!\\n\\nTime did not compose her.  As she reflected more, she seemed\\nbut to feel it more.  She never had been so depressed.  Happily it\\nwas not necessary to speak.  There was only Harriet, who seemed not\\nin spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma\\nfelt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,\\nwithout being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma\\'s thoughts all\\nthe evening.  How it might be considered by the rest of the party,\\nshe could not tell.  They, in their different homes, and their different\\nways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it\\nwas a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,\\nthan any she had ever passed.  A whole evening of back-gammon with\\nher father, was felicity to it.  _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure,\\nfor there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four\\nto his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree\\nof his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her\\ngeneral conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,\\nshe hoped she was not without a heart.  She hoped no one could\\nhave said to her, \"How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--\\nI must, I will tell you truths while I can.\"  Miss Bates should\\nnever again--no, never!  If attention, in future, could do away\\nthe past, she might hope to be forgiven.  She had been often remiss,\\nher conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought\\nthan fact; scornful, ungracious.  But it should be so no more.\\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the\\nvery next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,\\nof a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\\n\\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,\\nthat nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,\\nthat she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might\\ncome in while she were paying her visit.  She had no objection.\\nShe would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly\\nand truly hers.  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she\\nsaw him not.\\n\\n\"The ladies were all at home.\"  She had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,\\nor of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\\n\\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\\nShe heard Miss Bates\\'s voice, something was to be done in a hurry;\\nthe maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased\\nto wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.  The aunt and\\nniece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.  Jane she had\\na distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door\\nhad shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, \"Well, my dear,\\nI shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are\\nill enough.\"\\n\\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she\\ndid not quite understand what was going on.\\n\\n\"I am afraid Jane is not very well,\" said she, \"but I do not know;\\nthey _tell_ me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\\nMiss Woodhouse.  I hope you find a chair.  I wish Hetty had not gone.\\nI am very little able--Have you a chair, ma\\'am? Do you sit where\\nyou like?  I am sure she will be here presently.\"\\n\\nEmma seriously hoped she would.  She had a moment\\'s fear of Miss\\nBates keeping away from her.  But Miss Bates soon came--\"Very happy\\nand obliged\"--but Emma\\'s conscience told her that there was not the\\nsame cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.\\nA very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead\\nthe way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate.\\n\\n\"Ah!  Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--\\nand are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,\\nindeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be\\nvery trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,\\nand she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--\\nsuch long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,\\nand Mrs. Dixon.  `My dear,\\' said I, `you will blind yourself\\'--\\nfor tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,\\none cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is\\namazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman\\nbefore ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,\\nMiss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing\\nher tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache\\nshe has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve.  She is as low as possible.\\nTo look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she\\nis to have secured such a situation.  You will excuse her not\\ncoming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--\\nI want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,\\' said I, `I shall\\nsay you are laid down upon the bed:\\'  but, however, she is not;\\nshe is walking about the room.  But, now that she has written\\nher letters, she says she shall soon be well.  She will be extremely\\nsorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will\\nexcuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--\\nbut somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we\\nhad not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did\\nnot know any body was coming.  `It is only Mrs. Cole,\\' said I,\\n`depend upon it.  Nobody else would come so early.\\'  `Well,\\' said she,\\n`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.\\'\\nBut then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!\\' said I,\\n`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.\\'--\\n`I can see nobody,\\' said she; and up she got, and would go away;\\nand that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry\\nand ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,\\' said I, `you must,\\nand I will say you are laid down upon the bed.\\'\"\\n\\nEmma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\\nbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\\nsensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\\nnaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,\\nwhen she might not bear to see herself.  She spoke as she felt,\\nwith earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the\\ncircumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually\\ndetermined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax\\'s advantage\\nand comfort as possible.  \"It must be a severe trial to them all.\\nShe had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell\\'s return.\"\\n\\n\"So very kind!\" replied Miss Bates.  \"But you are always kind.\"\\n\\nThere was no bearing such an \"always;\" and to break through her\\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\\n\\n\"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\"\\n\\n\"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have\\nthe charge of her three little girls--delightful children.\\nImpossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;\\nif we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling\\'s own family, and Mrs. Bragge\\'s;\\nbut Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very\\nsame neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.\\nJane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.  The most indefatigable, true friend.\\nShe would not take a denial.  She would not let Jane say, `No;\\' for\\nwhen Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,\\nthe very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,\\nshe was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the\\nreasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind\\nto close with nothing till Colonel Campbell\\'s return, and nothing\\nshould induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she\\ntold Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more\\nidea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,\\nwhose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.  It is not\\nevery body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,\\nand refuse to take Jane\\'s answer; but she positively declared she\\nwould _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;\\nshe would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all\\nsettled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not\\nthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,\\nthat upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge\\'s situation,\\nshe had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word\\nof it till it was all settled.\"\\n\\n\"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.  It was settled so,\\nupon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.\\n`You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us,\\' said she--`I positively must\\nhave you _all_ come.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?\"\\n\\n\"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\\nhim off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\\nand a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,\\nMiss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body\\nseemed rather fagged after the morning\\'s party.  Even pleasure,\\nyou know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed\\nvery much to have enjoyed it.  However, _I_ shall always think it\\na very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends\\nwho included me in it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she had.\"\\n\\n\"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all\\nher friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation\\nthat is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing\\nin the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings\\nand Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,\\nso liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton\\'s acquaintance.\\nMrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost\\nequal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little\\nSucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet\\nchildren anywhere.  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--\\nIt will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--\\nI really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.\\nEven you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that\\nso much could be given to a young person like Jane.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! madam,\" cried Emma, \"if other children are at all like what I\\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount\\nof what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,\\ndearly earned.\"\\n\\n\"You are so noble in your ideas!\"\\n\\n\"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\"\\n\\n\"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that\\'s the worst of it.\\nWithin a fortnight.  Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.  My poor\\nmother does not know how to bear it.  So then, I try to put it out of\\nher thoughts, and say, Come ma\\'am, do not let us think about it any more.\"\\n\\n\"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel\\nand Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself\\nbefore their return?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such\\na situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.\\nI was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying\\nto Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating\\nme upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,\\nbecause we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,\\nbecause I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;\\nsomething happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called\\nout of the room before tea, old John Abdy\\'s son wanted to speak\\nwith him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk\\nto my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is\\nbed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--\\nI must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she\\ngets out at all.  And poor John\\'s son came to talk to Mr. Elton\\nabout relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,\\nyou know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\\nof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\\nand so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler\\nhad been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having\\nbeen sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.\\nThat was what happened before tea.  It was after tea that Jane spoke\\nto Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly\\nnew this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it\\npossible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars\\nof Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s going, she proceeded to give them all,\\nit was of no consequence.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\\naccumulation of the ostler\\'s own knowledge, and the knowledge\\nof the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over\\nfrom Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--\\nwhich messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;\\nand that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,\\nupon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only\\nwishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;\\nbut that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,\\nwithout waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,\\nTom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the\\nostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,\\nand driving very steady.\\n\\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,\\nand it caught Emma\\'s attention only as it united with the subject\\nwhich already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill\\'s\\nimportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax\\'s, struck her; one was\\nevery thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference\\nof woman\\'s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\\ntill roused by Miss Bates\\'s saying,\\n\\n\"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become\\nof that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--\\n`You must go,\\' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no\\nbusiness here.--Let it stay, however,\\' said she; `give it houseroom\\ntill Colonel Campbell comes back.  I shall talk about it to him;\\nhe will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.\\'--\\nAnd to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his\\npresent or his daughter\\'s.\"\\n\\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance\\nof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been\\nlong enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could\\nventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma\\'s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were\\nsitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a\\nmanner decidedly graver than usual, said,\\n\\n\"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\\nand therefore must now be gone directly.  I am going to London,\\nto spend a few days with John and Isabella.  Have you any thing to\\nsend or say, besides the `love,\\' which nobody carries?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all.  But is not this a sudden scheme?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.\"\\n\\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.\\nTime, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be\\nfriends again.  While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--\\nher father began his inquiries.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you\\nfind my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must\\nhave been very much obliged to you for coming.  Dear Emma has been\\nto call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.\\nShe is always so attentive to them!\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\\nand shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--\\nIt seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,\\nas if his eyes received the truth from her\\'s, and all that had\\npassed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard.  She was warmly gratified--\\nand in another moment still more so, by a little movement of\\nmore than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--\\nwhether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--\\nshe might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,\\npressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--\\nwhen, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel\\nsuch a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,\\nshe could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,\\nif he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;\\nand whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,\\nor however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--\\nIt was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--\\nShe could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.\\nIt spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--\\ngone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which\\ncould neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden\\nthan usual in his disappearance.\\n\\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished\\nshe had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great\\npleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax\\'s situation with Mr. Knightley.--\\nNeither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,\\nfor she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have\\nhappened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,\\nwould have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;\\nshe could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,\\nand his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she\\nhad fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them\\nhalf an hour, she found.  It was a pity that she had not come\\nback earlier!\\n\\nIn the hope of diverting her father\\'s thoughts from the disagreeableness\\nof Mr. Knightley\\'s going to London; and going so suddenly;\\nand going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\\nEmma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence\\non the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--\\ninterested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane\\nFairfax\\'s going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,\\nbut Mr. Knightley\\'s going to London had been an unexpected blow.\\n\\n\"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so\\ncomfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,\\nand I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought\\nto be.  I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health\\nwill be taken good care of.  It ought to be a first object,\\nas I am sure poor Miss Taylor\\'s always was with me.  You know,\\nmy dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\\nwas to us.  And I hope she will be better off in one respect,\\nand not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.\"\\n\\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every\\nthing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls\\nto announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!  Though her nephew\\nhad had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,\\nshe had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.\\nA sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded\\nby her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.\\nThe great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\\n\\nIt was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a\\ndegree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,\\nsolicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,\\ncuriosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,\\nthat when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do\\nbut to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally\\nto be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,\\nafter being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of\\nwith compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified.\\nShe had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event\\nacquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness\\nof imaginary complaints.\\n\\n\"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\\nmore than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try\\nthe temper.  It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,\\nwhat would Mr. Churchill do without her?  Mr. Churchill\\'s loss\\nwould be dreadful indeed.  Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\"--\\nEven Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,\\n\"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!\" and resolved, that his\\nmourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing\\nand moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,\\ntrue and steady.  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest\\nthoughts of both.  It was also a very early speculation with Emma.\\nThe character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind\\nglanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested\\nwith lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,\\nhow benefited, how freed.  She saw in a moment all the possible good.\\nNow, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.\\nMr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;\\nan easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.\\nAll that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\\nthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\\nno certainty of its being already formed.\\n\\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\\nWhat ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was\\ngratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\\nThey spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill\\'s death with mutual forbearance.\\n\\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating\\nall that was immediately important of their state and plans.\\nMr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their\\nfirst removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,\\nwas to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom\\nMr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.\\nAt present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes\\nfor the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma\\'s side.\\n\\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,\\nwhose prospects were closing, while Harriet\\'s opened, and whose\\nengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished\\nto shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.\\nShe had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;\\nand the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now\\nthe very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of\\nregard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew\\na value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.\\nShe resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.\\nA note was written to urge it.  The invitation was refused, and by\\na verbal message.  \"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\"\\nand when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,\\nit appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made\\nhim doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge\\'s at the\\ntime proposed.  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--\\nappetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely\\nalarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,\\nwhich was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was\\nuneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she\\nwas equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would\\nnot own it.  Her spirits seemed overcome.  Her present home,\\nhe could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--\\nconfined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--\\nand her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge\\nto be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.\\nHer care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,\\nonly too great.  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more\\nevil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;\\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover\\nsome way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour\\nor two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,\\nand quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,\\nmight do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,\\nin the most feeling language she could command, that she would\\ncall for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--\\nmentioning that she had Mr. Perry\\'s decided opinion, in favour\\nof such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this\\nshort note:\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax\\'s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal\\nto any exercise.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it\\nwas impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality\\nshewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she\\nmight best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.\\nIn spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove\\nto Mrs. Bates\\'s, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--\\nbut it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,\\nand agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of\\nthe greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--\\nbut all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;\\nJane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out\\nseemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,\\nand tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,\\nMiss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on\\nno account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  \"Indeed, the truth was,\\nthat poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--\\nMrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made\\nsuch a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,\\nJane would really see nobody.\"\\n\\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;\\nneither could she feel any right of preference herself--\\nshe submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther\\nas to her niece\\'s appetite and diet, which she longed to be able\\nto assist.  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,\\nand very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--\\nMr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could\\ncommand (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.\\n\\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.\\nIn half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks\\nfrom Miss Bates, but \"dear Jane would not be satisfied without its\\nbeing sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,\\nshe insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\"\\n\\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon\\nof the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal\\nto any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in\\nthe carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--\\nthat Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_.  She was sorry,\\nvery sorry.  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed\\nbut the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,\\ninconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified\\nher that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed\\nso little worthy as a friend:  but she had the consolation of knowing\\nthat her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,\\nthat could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts\\nof assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,\\nhe would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill\\'s decease,\\nEmma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \"could not stay\\nfive minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.\"--\\nHe met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,\\nin the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,\\nunheard by her father,\\n\\n\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it\\nbe possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.\"\\n\\n\"Is she unwell?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have\\nordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,\\nand that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to\\nrefuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?--\\nIs she really not ill?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it\\nall in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!\"\\n\\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.\\nSomething really important seemed announced by his looks;\\nbut, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,\\nand settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,\\nshe and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on\\ntheir way at a quick pace for Randalls.\\n\\n\"Now,\"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\\n\"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don\\'t ask me.  I promised my wife\\nto leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can.\\nDo not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Break it to me,\" cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\\n\"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened\\nin Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell\\nme this moment what it is.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed you are mistaken.\"--\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?--\\nI charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma.\"--\\n\\n\"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,\\nthat it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can\\nbe to be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour,\" said he very seriously, \"it does not.  It is not\\nin the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name\\nof Knightley.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s courage returned, and she walked on.\\n\\n\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\\nI should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--\\nit concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,\\nmy dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.\\nI don\\'t say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might\\nbe much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\"\\n\\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.\\nShe asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,\\nand that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some\\nmoney concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable\\nnature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late\\nevent at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active.\\nHalf a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--\\nThis, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.\\nIt inspired little more than an animating curiosity.\\n\\n\"Who is that gentleman on horseback?\" said she, as they proceeded--\\nspeaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with\\nany other view.\\n\\n\"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,\\nI assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor\\nby this time.\"\\n\\n\"Has your son been with you, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\"\\n\\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more\\nguarded and demure,\\n\\n\"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\"\\n\\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\"\\nsaid he, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now\\nI hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together.\\nThere is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"--\\nAnd Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he\\nquitted the room,--\"I have been as good as my word.  She has not the\\nleast idea.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\\nthat Emma\\'s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,\\nshe eagerly said,\\n\\n\"What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,\\nI find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.\\nI have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both\\nabhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you\\ngood to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\\n\"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you\\nare to hear?\"\\n\\n\"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\"\\n\\n\"You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\"\\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)\\n\"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.\\nIt is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his\\nfather on a subject,--to announce an attachment--\"\\n\\nShe stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then\\nof Harriet.\\n\\n\"More than an attachment, indeed,\" resumed Mrs. Weston; \"an engagement--\\na positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any\\nbody say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax\\nare engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\"\\n\\nEmma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\\nand talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\\n\"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn\\nengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,\\nand kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it\\nbut themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--\\nIt is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,\\nit is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--\\nI thought I knew him.\"\\n\\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between\\ntwo ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;\\nand poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,\\nand require confirmation, repeated confirmation.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she at last, trying to recover herself; \"this is a\\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I\\ncan at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--\\nbefore either of them came to Highbury?\"\\n\\n\"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,\\nEmma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  _Some_ _part_\\nof his conduct we cannot excuse.\"\\n\\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, \"I will not pretend\\n_not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,\\nbe assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,\\nas you are apprehensive of.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma\\'s countenance\\nwas as steady as her words.\\n\\n\"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\\npresent perfect indifference,\" she continued, \"I will farther tell you,\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,\\nwhen I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be\\nattached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,\\nis perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease.\\nI have really for some time past, for at least these three months,\\ncared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.\\nThis is the simple truth.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could\\nfind utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done\\nher more good than any thing else in the world could do.\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\" said she.\\n\"On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.\"\\n\\n\"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of\\ngrateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_,\\nMrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.\\nWhat right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,\\nand with manners so _very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour\\nto please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with\\npersevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged\\nto another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--\\nHow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--\\nvery wrong, very wrong indeed.\"\\n\\n\"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\"\\n\\n\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!\\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\\nbefore her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.\"\\n\\n\"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said\\nso expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation.\\nHe was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation\\nwhich did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--\\nbut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.\\nThe present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;\\nand those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the\\nimpropriety of his conduct.\"\\n\\n\"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.\\nMuch, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how\\nit has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--\\nNone of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth\\nand principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man\\nshould display in every transaction of his life.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been\\nwrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer\\nfor his having many, very many, good qualities; and--\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!\\nJane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he\\nmean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--\\nto suffer her even to think of such a measure!\"\\n\\n\"He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully\\nacquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated\\nto him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--\\nTill yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.\\nThey burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--\\nand it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project\\nof hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it\\nall to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,\\nput an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been\\ncarrying on so long.\"\\n\\nEmma began to listen better.\\n\\n\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston.  \"He told me\\nat parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.\\nLet us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.\\nIt may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are\\nnot to be understood.  Don\\'t let us be severe, don\\'t let us be in\\na hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;\\nand now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,\\nI am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready\\nto hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal\\nunder such a system of secresy and concealment.\"\\n\\n\"_His_ sufferings,\" replied Emma dryly, \"do not appear to have done\\nhim much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\"\\n\\n\"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely\\na difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done\\nin that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there\\ncould not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely\\nare her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is\\npersuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.\\nWhat a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--\\nHe gave his consent with very little persuasion.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light\\nthis morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates\\'s, I fancy,\\nsome time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get\\nback to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,\\nthat, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--\\nHe was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made\\nhim appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen\\nhim before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of\\nfinding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--\\nand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on\\nwith such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none\\nof them know of the engagement?\"\\n\\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\\n\\n\"None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no\\nbeing in the world but their two selves.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled\\nto the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always\\nthink it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been\\nbut a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--\\nTo come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;\\nand such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,\\nthe whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves\\nall on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the\\nmidst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting\\nin judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both\\nto hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each\\nother spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!\"\\n\\n\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"I am\\nvery sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,\\nwhich both might not have heard.\"\\n\\n\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,\\nwhen you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"\\n\\n\"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;\\nand as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\\nevidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited\\nhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, \"Now, dearest Emma,\\nlet me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his\\nheart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.\\nLet us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may\\nbe fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;\\nbut if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it\\nmay be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,\\nthat he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness\\nof character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--\\nand still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this\\none great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much\\nmay be said in her situation for even that error!\"\\n\\n\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly.  \"If a woman can ever\\nbe excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation\\nlike Jane Fairfax\\'s.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the\\nworld is not their\\'s, nor the world\\'s law.\\'\"\\n\\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\\nexclaiming,\\n\\n\"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!\\nThis was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,\\nand exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me.\\nI thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,\\ninstead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one\\nof congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,\\non the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished\\nyoung women in England for your daughter.\"\\n\\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was\\nas right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\\nwas immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:\\nhe shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered\\non the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted\\ntime and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.\\nHis companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,\\nor smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all\\nover together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,\\nin their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,\\nand not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could\\npossibly have done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n\"Harriet, poor Harriet!\"--Those were the words; in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved\\nvery ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much\\n_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.\\nIt was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet\\'s account,\\nthat gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second\\ntime the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley\\nhad spoken prophetically, when he once said, \"Emma, you have been\\nno friend to Harriet Smith.\"--She was afraid she had done her nothing\\nbut disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,\\nin this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original\\nauthor of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might\\notherwise never have entered Harriet\\'s imagination; for Harriet\\nhad acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill\\nbefore she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt\\ncompletely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.\\nShe might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.\\nHer influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious\\nthat she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been\\nrisking her friend\\'s happiness on most insufficient grounds.\\nCommon sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she\\nmust not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five\\nhundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--\"But, with\\ncommon sense,\" she added, \"I am afraid I have had little to do.\"\\n\\nShe was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been\\nangry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--\\nAs for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings\\nfrom any present solicitude on her account.  Harriet would\\nbe anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,\\nwhose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,\\nmust be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil\\nwere over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--\\nEmma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.\\nThis discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No doubt it had been\\nfrom jealousy.--In Jane\\'s eyes she had been a rival; and well might\\nany thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.\\nAn airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.\\nShe understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself\\nfrom the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged\\nthat Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond\\nher desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!\\nThere was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.\\nEmma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be\\nmore severe than the first.  Considering the very superior claims\\nof the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect\\non Harriet\\'s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--\\nShe must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon\\nas possible.  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston\\'s\\nparting words.  \"For the present, the whole affair was to be\\ncompletely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,\\nas a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\"--\\nEmma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her\\nsuperior duty.\\n\\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,\\nthat she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to\\nperform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.\\nThe intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat\\nquick on hearing Harriet\\'s footstep and voice; so, she supposed,\\nhad poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.\\nCould the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--\\nBut of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\\n\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\"\\n\\n\"What news do you mean?\" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look\\nor voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\\n\\n\"About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange?\\nOh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has\\ntold me himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be\\na great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning\\nit to any body but you, but he said you knew it.\"\\n\\n\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.\\n\\n\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank\\nChurchill are to be married, and that they have been privately\\nengaged to one another this long while.  How very odd!\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet\\'s behaviour was so extremely odd,\\nthat Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,\\nor disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked\\nat her, quite unable to speak.\\n\\n\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love\\nwith her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)\\nwho can see into every body\\'s heart; but nobody else--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Emma, \"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\\nto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--\\nencouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had\\nthe slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill\\'s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be\\nvery sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  \"Why should you\\ncaution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\"\\nreplied Emma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there\\nwas a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason\\nto understand that you did care about him?\"\\n\\n\"Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\"\\nturning away distressed.\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment\\'s pause--\"What do you mean?--\\nGood Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"\\n\\nShe could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she\\nsat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\\n\\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned\\nfrom her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,\\nit was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma\\'s.\\n\\n\"I should not have thought it possible,\" she began, \"that you\\ncould have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--\\nbut considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,\\nI should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed\\nto mean any other person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not\\nknow who would ever look at him in the company of the other.\\nI hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nwho is like nobody by his side.  And that you should have been\\nso mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you\\nentirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,\\nI should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\\nto dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me\\nthat more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\\nmatches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--\\nI should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought\\nit possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--\"\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us\\nunderstand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.\\nAre you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--\\nand so I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear\\nas possible.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that\\nyou then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.\\nI could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.\\nI am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,\\nin protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I\\nsaid on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at\\nyour attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,\\nit was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself\\nvery warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning\\neven what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward\\nto your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" cried Harriet, \"now I recollect what you mean; but I\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not\\nthe gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with\\nsome elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--\\nof Mr. Knightley\\'s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton\\nwould not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in\\nthe room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence\\nand generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel\\nhow superior he was to every other being upon earth.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--\\nmost deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\"\\n\\n\"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?\\nAt least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,\\nif the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\"\\n\\nShe paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.\\n\\n\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel\\na great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.\\nYou must think one five hundred million times more above me than\\nthe other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--\\nstrange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,\\nthat _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity\\nhad taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,\\nit seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--\\nand if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--\\nif Mr. Knightley should really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity,\\nI hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,\\nand try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round\\nto look at her in consternation, and hastily said,\\n\\n\"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley\\'s returning your affection?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say\\nthat I have.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,\\nonce opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--\\nshe admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it\\nso much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,\\nthan with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased\\nby Harriet\\'s having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,\\nwith the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one\\nbut herself!\\n\\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the\\nsame few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had\\nnever blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting\\nby Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,\\nhow unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,\\nhad led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she\\nwas ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion\\nof respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--\\nsome concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice\\nby Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl\\nwho believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)\\ngave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,\\nwith even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit\\nthat the utmost extent of Harriet\\'s hopes should be enquired into;\\nand Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest\\nwhich had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve\\nto be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--\\nRousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,\\nshe turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed\\nthe conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,\\nthe wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--\\nNeither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\\n\\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\\nand such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,\\nto give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\\ndelight.--Emma\\'s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,\\nwere better concealed than Harriet\\'s, but they were not less.\\nHer voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation\\nthat such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,\\nsuch a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--\\nShe listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward\\npatience, to Harriet\\'s detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,\\nor very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;\\nbut it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and\\ntautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--\\nespecially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory\\nbrought in favour of Mr. Knightley\\'s most improved opinion of Harriet.\\n\\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\nfound her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening,\\nor at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse\\'s encouraging her\\nto think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\\nto her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having\\nindeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\\nand sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.\\nWhen they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked\\nby her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be\\nacquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case.\\nShe had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--\\nHarriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--\\nand Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\\nknown of his opinion of Harriet.  He praised her for being without\\nart or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--\\nShe knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt\\non them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet\\'s memory,\\nmany little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,\\na speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,\\na preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\\nby Emma.  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour\\'s relation,\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences\\nto be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not\\nwithout some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk\\nat Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,\\nand he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from\\nthe rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more\\nparticular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular\\nway indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed\\nto be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--\\nBut as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,\\nhe changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--\\nThe second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\\nbefore Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his\\nbeing at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said\\nthat he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,\\nduring their conversation, that though he must go to London,\\nit was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,\\nwhich was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.\\nThe superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one\\narticle marked, gave her severe pain.\\n\\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,\\nafter a little reflection, venture the following question.\\n\"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,\\ninto the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--\\nhe might have Mr. Martin\\'s interest in view?  But Harriet rejected\\nthe suspicion with spirit.\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.\\nI hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be\\nsuspected of it.\"\\n\\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear\\nMiss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\\n\\n\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she,\\n\"but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let\\nhis behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem\\nto feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,\\nit will not be any thing so very wonderful.\"\\n\\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma\\'s side,\\nto enable her to say on reply,\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is\\nthe last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman\\nthe idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.\"\\n\\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;\\nand Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at\\nthat moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\\nfather\\'s footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was\\ntoo much agitated to encounter him.  \"She could not compose herself--\\nMr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\"--with most ready\\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\\nanother door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\\nburst of Emma\\'s feelings:  \"Oh God! that I had never seen her!\"\\n\\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough\\nfor her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion\\nof all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.\\nEvery moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize\\nmust be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!\\nHow to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising\\non herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her\\nown head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her\\nown room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,\\nshe perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed\\non by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing\\non herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,\\nand should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.\\n\\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the\\nfirst endeavour.  To that point went every leisure moment which her\\nfather\\'s claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary\\nabsence of mind.\\n\\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\\ndeclared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--\\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\\nshe compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in\\nher estimation, from the time of the latter\\'s becoming known to her--\\nand as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--\\noh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute\\nthe comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she\\ndid not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when\\nhis regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.  She saw,\\nthat in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,\\nshe had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her\\nown heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank\\nChurchill at all!\\n\\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.\\nThis was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,\\nwhich she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--\\nShe was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation\\nbut the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--\\nEvery other part of her mind was disgusting.\\n\\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\\nbody\\'s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\\nbody\\'s destiny.  She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\\nand she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief.\\nShe had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,\\non Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to\\ntake place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it\\na beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only\\nby a consciousness of Harriet\\'s;--and even were this not the case,\\nhe would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.\\n\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\\nwonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane\\nFairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,\\nexciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing\\nto be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an\\nelevation on her side!  Such a debasement on his!  It was horrible\\nto Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,\\nto foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at\\nhis expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand\\ninconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.\\nAnd yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new\\ncircumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by\\nvery inferior powers?  Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek,\\nto be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any\\nthing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for\\nchance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?\\n\\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward!  Had she left her where\\nshe ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,\\nwith a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying\\nthe unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy\\nand respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--\\nall would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\\n\\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise\\nher thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy\\nherself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--\\nBut Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--\\nHer inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--\\nShe had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton\\'s being to stoop\\nin marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley\\'s.--\\nAlas! was not that her own doing too?  Who had been at pains to give\\nHarriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself\\nhad taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--\\nIf Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\\nfirst in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,\\nand feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;\\nand only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly\\nimportant it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;\\nfor, having no female connexions of his own, there had been\\nonly Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she\\nhad always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.\\nShe had herself been first with him for many years past.\\nShe had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,\\nslighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of\\nhalf his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not\\nacknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\\nfrom family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,\\nhe had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour\\nto improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\\nother creature had at all shared.  In spite of all her faults,\\nshe knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--\\nWhen the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,\\npresented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.\\nHarriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,\\nexclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.  _She_ could not.\\nShe could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment\\nto _her_.  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--\\nHow shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!  How directly,\\nhow strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too\\nstrongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from\\nany feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--\\nShe had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could\\nhave that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;\\nbut there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)\\nthat Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his\\nregard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence\\nnothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\\nCould she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,\\nshe believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue\\nthe same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley\\nto all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their\\nprecious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\\nwould be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.\\nIt would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with\\nwhat she felt for him.  Nothing should separate her from her father.\\nShe would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;\\nand she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at\\nleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should\\nsee them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly\\nas she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,\\nshe did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--\\nHe was expected back every day.  The power of observation would be\\nsoon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in\\none course.  In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--\\nIt would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,\\nto be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,\\nas long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing\\nHarriet\\'s confidence.  To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote\\nto her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,\\nat present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,\\nthat all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better\\nbe avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before\\nthey met again, except in the company of others--she objected only\\nto a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten\\nthe conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,\\nand was grateful.\\n\\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma\\'s\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,\\nto relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\\n\\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates\\'s, and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having\\nthen induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned\\nwith much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,\\nthan a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates\\'s parlour, with all\\nthe encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\\n\\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while\\nher friend related.  Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit\\nin a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had\\nwished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write\\nto Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till\\na little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled\\nto the engagement\\'s becoming known; as, considering every thing,\\nshe thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--\\nbut Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious\\nto shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not\\nconceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,\\nthat it would be of any consequence; for \"such things,\" he observed,\\n\"always got about.\"  Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had\\nvery good reason for saying so.  They had gone, in short--and very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.\\nShe had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action\\nhad shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,\\nheart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight\\nof her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,\\nhad been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were\\nboth so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested\\nin every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,\\nand so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work\\nfor them.  Miss Fairfax\\'s recent illness had offered a fair plea\\nfor Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and\\ndeclined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the\\ncourse of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,\\novercome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse\\non the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious\\nsilence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the\\ngratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,\\nmust necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,\\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\\nof the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation\\nmust be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own\\nmind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased\\nwith all that she had said on the subject.\\n\\n\"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment\\nof so many months,\" continued Mrs. Weston, \"she was energetic.\\nThis was one of her expressions.  `I will not say, that since I\\nentered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I\\ncan say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:\\'--\\nand the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation\\nthat I felt at my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma.  \"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\nconsented to a private engagement?\"\\n\\n\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself.  `The consequence,\\' said she, `has been a state\\nof perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\\nPain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be.\\'  `Do not imagine, madam,\\'\\nshe continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection\\nfall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\\nme up.  The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,\\nwith all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,\\nI shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again.  \"She loves him then excessively,\\nI suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could\\nbe led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered\\nher judgment.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" returned Emma, sighing, \"that I must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding\\nto the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.\\nOne natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"\\nshe said, \"was that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness\\nof having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,\\nand made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--\\nthat had been--hard for him to bear.  `I did not make the allowances,\\'\\nsaid she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--\\nhis delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness\\nof disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,\\nhave been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.\\'\\nShe then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you\\nhad shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me\\nhow it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,\\nto thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and\\nevery endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"\\n\\n\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously,\\n\"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\\nconscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!\\nMrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil\\nand the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,\\nand trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.\\nYou are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.\\nThey shew her to the greatest advantage.  I am sure she is very good--\\nI hope she will be very happy.  It is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\"\\n\\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.\\nShe thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,\\nshe loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.\\nShe talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--\\nbut she had too much to urge for Emma\\'s attention; it was soon gone\\nto Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;\\nand when Mrs. Weston ended with, \"We have not yet had the letter\\nwe are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,\"\\nshe was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged\\nto answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it\\nwas which they were so anxious for.\\n\\n\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston\\'s parting question.\\n\\n\"Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston\\'s communications furnished Emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,\\nand her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly\\nregretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed\\nfor the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,\\nthe cause.  Had she followed Mr. Knightley\\'s known wishes, in paying\\nthat attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she\\ntried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;\\nhad she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;\\nshe must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain\\nwhich pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,\\nhad been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received\\nwith gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that\\nthey had never become intimate friends; that she had never been\\nadmitted into Miss Fairfax\\'s confidence on this important matter--\\nwhich was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,\\nand as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable\\nsuspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\\nnot only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made\\na subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane\\'s feelings,\\nby the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill\\'s.  Of all the sources\\nof evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,\\nshe was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.\\nShe must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been\\nall three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax\\'s peace\\nin a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been\\nthe agony of a mind that would bear no more.\\n\\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\\nThe weather added what it could of gloom.  A cold stormy rain set in,\\nand nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\\nwind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made\\nsuch cruel sights the longer visible.\\n\\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter\\'s side,\\nand by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.\\nIt reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening\\nof Mrs. Weston\\'s wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked\\nin then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.\\nAlas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield\\'s attraction, as those\\nsort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which\\nshe had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,\\nhad proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures\\nhad been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would\\nexperience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her now,\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--\\nthat might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place\\nthat might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must\\nbe comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\\n\\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer\\nthan herself; and Mrs. Weston\\'s heart and time would be occupied\\nby it.  They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,\\nher husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;\\nand Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease\\nto belong to Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either\\nat or near Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if\\nto these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would\\nremain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?\\nMr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--\\nNo longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change\\nhis own home for their\\'s!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were\\nto be lost to them for Harriet\\'s sake; if he were to be thought\\nof hereafter, as finding in Harriet\\'s society all that he wanted;\\nif Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,\\nthe wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;\\nwhat could be increasing Emma\\'s wretchedness but the reflection never far\\ndistant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?\\n\\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain\\nfrom a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room\\nfor a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\\nor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own\\nbetter conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and\\ngaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life\\nto the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted\\nwith herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning;\\nand the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to\\nreign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind\\nchanged into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;\\nthe sun appeared; it was summer again.  With all the eagerness\\nwhich such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors\\nas soon as possible.  Never had the exquisite sight, smell,\\nsensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,\\nbeen more attractive to her.  She longed for the serenity they might\\ngradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry\\'s coming in soon after dinner,\\nwith a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill\\nhurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,\\nand thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she\\nsaw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\\ntowards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned\\nfrom London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before,\\nas unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for\\nthe quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm.\\nIn half a minute they were together.  The \"How d\\'ye do\\'s\" were quiet\\nand constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;\\nthey were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.\\nHe must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,\\nshe found.  \"He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he\\nwas not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought\\nhe neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible\\ncause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been\\ncommunicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner\\nin which they had been received.\\n\\nThey walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often\\nlooking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\\nsuited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread.\\nPerhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;\\nhe might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,\\ncould not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.\\nHe must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence.\\nWith him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying\\nto smile, began--\\n\\n\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\\nsurprize you.\"\\n\\n\"Have I?\" said he quietly, and looking at her; \"of what nature?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\"\\n\\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\\nhe replied,\\n\\n\"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard\\nthat already.\"\\n\\n\"How is it possible?\" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks\\ntowards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he\\nmight have called at Mrs. Goddard\\'s in his way.\\n\\n\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,\\nand at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little\\nmore composure,\\n\\n\"_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\\nhad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\\nme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking\\nvoice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious\\nof having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm\\ndrawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him\\nthus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\\n\\n\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own\\nexcellent sense--your exertions for your father\\'s sake--I know\\nyou will not allow yourself--.\"  Her arm was pressed again,\\nas he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, \"The feelings\\nof the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\"--\\nAnd in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, \"He will soon\\nbe gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.\\nShe deserves a better fate.\"\\n\\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the\\nflutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\\n\\n\"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\\nI am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what\\nwas going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always\\nbe ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many\\nthings which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I\\nhave no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"\\n\\n\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--\\nbut checking himself--\"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am\\npleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,\\nindeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes\\nthe acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your\\naffections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,\\nfrom your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--\\nI could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference\\nwhich I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name\\nof man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--\\nJane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\\n\"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in\\nyour error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,\\nI have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have\\nbeen at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might\\nbe natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--\\nBut I never have.\"\\n\\nHe listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he\\nwould not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled\\nto his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower\\nherself in his opinion.  She went on, however.\\n\\n\"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted\\nby his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--\\nAn old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened\\nto hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable\\nin one who sets up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances\\nassisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was\\ncontinually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,\\nfor (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,\\nthey all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I\\nallowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--\\nI have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them\\na habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.  I have never been\\nattached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.\\nHe never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal\\nhis real situation with another.--It was his object to blind\\nall about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually\\nblinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my\\ngood fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him.\"\\n\\nShe had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far\\nas she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably\\nin his usual tone, he said,\\n\\n\"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\\nhowever, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with\\nhim has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated\\nhim hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has\\na chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,\\nwhose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,\\nI shall certainly wish him well.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of their being happy together,\" said Emma;\\n\"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\"\\n\\n\"He is a most fortunate man!\" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.\\n\"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man\\nchuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty\\nto have drawn such a prize!  What years of felicity that man,\\nin all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of\\nsuch a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax\\'s character\\nvouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--\\nequality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the\\nhabits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--\\nand that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,\\nsuch as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the\\nonly advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman\\na better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,\\nwhere there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be the happiest\\nof mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.\\nEvery thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman\\nat a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\\nby negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round\\nthe world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\\nher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has\\nonly to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--\\nHe had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--\\nHe is a fortunate man indeed!\"\\n\\n\"You speak as if you envied him.\"\\n\\n\"And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy.\"\\n\\nEmma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence\\nof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,\\nif possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something\\ntotally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she\\nonly waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,\\nby saying,\\n\\n\"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,\\nI see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise.\\nEmma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it\\nunsaid the next moment.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then, don\\'t speak it, don\\'t speak it,\" she eagerly cried.\\n\"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\\nanother syllable followed.\\n\\nEmma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--\\nperhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;\\nshe might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him\\nhis own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,\\nwhich must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind\\nas his.--They had reached the house.\\n\\n\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.\\n\\n\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner\\nin which he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn.\\nMr. Perry is not gone.\"  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\\n\"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,\\ngave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me\\nas a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have\\nin contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will\\nhear whatever you like.  I will tell you exactly what I think.\"\\n\\n\"As a friend!\"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma, that I fear is\\na word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--\\nI have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--\\nExtraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you\\nas a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\"\\n\\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\\nof his eyes overpowered her.\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma,\" said he, \"for dearest you will always be,\\nwhatever the event of this hour\\'s conversation, my dearest,\\nmost beloved Emma--tell me at once.  Say `No,\\' if it is to be said.\"--\\nShe could really say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried,\\nwith great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"\\n\\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.\\nThe dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps\\nthe most prominent feeling.\\n\\n\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\"  he soon resumed; and in a tone\\nof such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was\\ntolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able\\nto talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing\\nbut truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you\\nhave borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--\\nBear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as\\nyou have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little\\nto recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--\\nBut you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--\\nand will return them if you can.  At present, I ask only to hear,\\nonce to hear your voice.\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke, Emma\\'s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\\nvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--\\nto catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\\nHarriet\\'s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,\\nas complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;\\nthat she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying\\nrelative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her\\nown feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,\\nher discouragement, had been all received as discouragement\\nfrom herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,\\nwith all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to\\nrejoice that Harriet\\'s secret had not escaped her, and to resolve\\nthat it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could\\nnow render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment\\nwhich might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection\\nfrom herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--\\nor even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him\\nat once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he\\ncould not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for Harriet,\\nwith pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,\\nopposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.\\nShe had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to\\nher for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,\\nand as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such\\nalliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear,\\nthough not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--\\nWhat did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--\\nShe said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him\\nto say more himself.  He _had_ despaired at one period; he had received\\nsuch an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed\\nevery hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had\\nperhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,\\nher renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,\\nmight be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;\\nbut Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no\\nfarther explanation.\\n\\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\\nseldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,\\nor a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct\\nis mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--\\nMr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than\\nshe possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.\\nHe had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.\\nHe had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill\\'s\\nengagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,\\nif she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest\\nhad been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,\\non his feelings.  The delightful assurance of her total indifference\\ntowards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged\\nfrom him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain\\nher affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,\\nin the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be\\ntold that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior\\nhopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--\\nThe affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,\\nif he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed\\nfrom a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like\\nperfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\\n\\n_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the\\nsame precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each\\nthe same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,\\nthere had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,\\nor even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love\\nwith Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,\\none sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.\\nIt was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from\\nthe country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.\\nHe would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,\\nencouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--\\nBut he had gone to a wrong place.  There was too much domestic\\nhappiness in his brother\\'s house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;\\nIsabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\\ninferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,\\nfor much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\\nstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning\\'s\\npost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the\\ngladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,\\nhaving never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,\\nwas there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\\nthat he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;\\nand had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest\\nand best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,\\nbore the discovery.\\n\\nHe had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill\\'s\\ncharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought\\nof Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort\\nof fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house\\nfrom what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope\\nfor a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite\\nflutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed\\nmust still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.\\n\\nThey sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--\\nhow often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen\\non the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful\\neffect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,\\nnever in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could\\nsummon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,\\nor even the attentive daughter.\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him\\nin the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he\\nhave seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;\\nbut without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,\\nwithout the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in\\nthe looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably\\nall the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked\\non with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they\\ncould have told him in return.\\n\\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma\\'s fever continued;\\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised\\nand subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was\\nthe tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious\\npoints to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness\\nmust have some alloy.  Her father--and Harriet.  She could not be\\nalone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;\\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.\\nWith respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.\\nShe hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short\\nparley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution\\nof never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,\\nas a sin of thought.  While he lived, it must be only an engagement;\\nbut she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\\ndrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--\\nHow to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--\\nhow to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make\\nher any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--\\nOn these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--\\nand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter\\nreproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--\\nShe could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a\\nmeeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;\\nthat it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just\\nnow for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--\\nnearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--\\nShe did not think it in Harriet\\'s nature to escape being benefited\\nby novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--\\nAt any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,\\nfrom whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting\\nof the evil day, when they must all be together again.\\n\\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment\\nwhich left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,\\nin walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;\\nand half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again\\nwith him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate\\nher in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.\\n\\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have\\nthe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter\\nwas brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed\\nwhat it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--\\nShe was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted\\nno explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--\\nand as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was\\nincapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened\\nthe packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,\\nushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding\\nto you the enclosed.  I know what thorough justice you will\\ndo it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think\\nwe shall never materially disagree about the writer again;\\nbut I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.--\\nThis letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have\\nbeen feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday,\\nbut it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being\\naffected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--\\nI felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\\nafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\\nlast night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\\n                              \"Yours ever,\\n                                                       \"A.

It is very difficult for the\\nprosperous to be humble.  I have already met with such success\\nin two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking\\nmyself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have\\nhad any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend\\nthe exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;\\nyou must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept\\nat all hazards.  This was the fact.  My right to place myself\\nin a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\\nI shall not discuss it here.  For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\\nI refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\\nand casements above, in Highbury.  I dared not address her openly;\\nmy difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well\\nknown to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,\\nbefore we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female\\nmind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--\\nHad she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,\\nwhat was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--\\nTo any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,\\nsudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.\\nEvery possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings\\nsecured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.\\nIf you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,\\nof being your husband\\'s son, and the advantage of inheriting\\na disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses\\nor lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these\\ncircumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I\\nam conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.\\nYou will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax\\nwas in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you will\\nforgive me instantly; but I must work on my father\\'s compassion,\\nby reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,\\nso long I lost the blessing of knowing you.  My behaviour,\\nduring the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,\\nI hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.\\nAnd now I come to the principal, the only important part of my\\nconduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,\\nor requires very solicitous explanation.  With the greatest respect,\\nand the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father\\nperhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--\\nA few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,\\nand some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\\nto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--\\nIn order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led\\non to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy\\ninto which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss\\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe\\nthe declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,\\nI would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--\\nAmiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me\\nthe idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was\\nperfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much\\nmy conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,\\nfriendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\\nWe seemed to understand each other.  From our relative situation,\\nthose attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss\\nWoodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of\\nthat fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,\\nI remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,\\nand I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no\\ndoubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--\\nShe may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\\nhave penetrated a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find,\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,\\nthat it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave\\nme hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I\\nowed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--\\nI hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted\\nby you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.\\nWhile you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,\\nI could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure\\nfor me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that\\nsaid Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,\\nas to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--\\nWhatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have\\nnow a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get\\nmy body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--\\nOf the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,\\nthat its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would\\nnever have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--\\nThe delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,\\nmy dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.\\nYou will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--\\nNo description can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--\\nyet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would\\nso designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,\\nwhich will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--\\nShe gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,\\nI dare not depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks.\\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\\nPerhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;\\nI am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few\\nminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:\\nand I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness\\nor misery.  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,\\nof her excellence and patience, and my uncle\\'s generosity, I am mad\\nwith joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her,\\nand how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.\\nIf I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.\\nMy uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add\\nto this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear.\\nI could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,\\nand, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,\\nneeds explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you\\nwill conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,\\nI should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the\\nvery particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.\\nI should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have\\nfelt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--\\nBut I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with\\nthat woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,\\nto recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,\\nand am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter\\nwhat it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect\\nfor me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners\\nto Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.\\n_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of\\nconcealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;\\nI thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,\\nunnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold.\\nBut she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued\\nmy spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\\nDo you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;\\nI met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,\\nbut she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,\\nwhich I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing\\nin it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.\\nWhile I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one\\nhour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she\\nto be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\\nevery previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together\\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--\\nI was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.\\nI doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by\\nsuch conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,\\nand such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her\\nresentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--\\nIn short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,\\nabominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,\\nthough I might have staid with you till the next morning,\\nmerely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,\\nI was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;\\nbut I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went\\naway determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall\\nalways congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.\\nHad you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would\\never have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon her appears\\nin the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I\\nwas really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\\nofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,\\nby the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.\\nI must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been\\nso richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.--\\n`Jane,\\' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself\\nin calling her by that name, even to you.  Think, then, what I must\\nhave endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all\\nthe vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of\\nimaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--\\nShe closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,\\nand wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--\\n_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\\n_to_ _each_:  _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This letter reached me on the very\\nmorning of my poor aunt\\'s death.  I answered it within an hour;\\nbut from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business\\nfalling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all\\nthe many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;\\nand I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,\\nto satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather\\ndisappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;\\nbut I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--\\ntoo cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;\\nand two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters\\nall returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,\\nstating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply\\nto her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both\\nto have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,\\nshe now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,\\nthat if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them\\nto Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period\\nto her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge\\'s,\\nnear Bristol, stared me in the face.  I knew the name, the place,\\nI knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.\\nIt was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\\nwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,\\nas to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive\\nof its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed\\nto threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually\\ndetected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--\\nWhat was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.\\nWithout his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--\\nI spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!\\nwith a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness\\nin the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be\\nof a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must\\nhave suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while\\nall was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,\\nand saw how ill I had made her.  Do not pity me till I saw her wan,\\nsick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\\nknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\\nof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was\\nnot disappointed either in the object of my journey.  A great deal\\nof very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.\\nBut it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,\\nand no moment\\'s uneasiness can ever occur between us again.  Now, my\\ndear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.\\nA thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart\\nwill dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier\\nthan I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me\\nthe child of good fortune.  I hope she is right.--In one respect,\\nmy good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\\nmyself,\\n                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\\n                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nThis letter must make its way to Emma\\'s feelings.  She was obliged,\\nin spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do\\nit all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.  As soon as she\\ncame to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating\\nto herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;\\nand when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,\\nby the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the\\nvery strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at\\nthat moment.  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;\\nand though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,\\nyet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,\\nand was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,\\nand so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,\\nthat there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,\\nshe must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\\n\\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\\nshe desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston\\'s wishing\\nit to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,\\nhad seen so much to blame in his conduct.\\n\\n\"I shall be very glad to look it over,\" said he; \"but it seems long.\\nI will take it home with me at night.\"\\n\\nBut that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,\\nand she must return it by him.\\n\\n\"I would rather be talking to you,\" he replied; \"but as it seems\\na matter of justice, it shall be done.\"\\n\\nHe began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \"Had I been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentleman\\'s letters to his mother-in-law a few\\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\"\\n\\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,\\nwith a smile, observed, \"Humph! a fine complimentary opening:\\nBut it is his way.  One man\\'s style must not be the rule of another\\'s.\\nWe will not be severe.\"\\n\\n\"It will be natural for me,\" he added shortly afterwards, \"to speak my\\nopinion aloud as I read.  By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\\nIt will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I should wish it.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\\n\\n\"He trifles here,\" said he, \"as to the temptation.  He knows\\nhe is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought\\nnot to have formed the engagement.--`His father\\'s disposition:\\'--\\nhe is unjust, however, to his father.  Mr. Weston\\'s sanguine\\ntemper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;\\nbut Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured\\nto gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.\"\\n\\n\"And I have not forgotten,\" said Emma, \"how sure you were that he\\nmight have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--\\nbut you were perfectly right.\"\\n\\n\"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--\\nhad _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\"\\n\\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole\\nof it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;\\na shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;\\nor merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,\\nseriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--\\n\\n\"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most\\ndangerous game.  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--\\nNo judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his\\nown wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--\\nFancying you to have fathomed his secret.  Natural enough!--\\nhis own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it\\nin others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!\\nMy Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the\\nbeauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?\"\\n\\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet\\'s account,\\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.\\n\\n\"You had better go on,\" said she.\\n\\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \"the pianoforte!\\nAh!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young\\nto consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much\\nexceed the pleasure.  A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot\\ncomprehend a man\\'s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection\\nwhich he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did\\nknow that she would have prevented the instrument\\'s coming if she could.\"\\n\\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause.\\nFrank Churchill\\'s confession of having behaved shamefully\\nwas the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.\\n\\n\"I perfectly agree with you, sir,\"--was then his remark.\\n\"You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line.\"\\nAnd having gone through what immediately followed of the basis\\nof their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct\\nopposition to Jane Fairfax\\'s sense of right, he made a fuller pause\\nto say, \"This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,\\nfor his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,\\nand it should have been his first object to prevent her from\\nsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,\\nin carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have\\nrespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers\\nwere all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember\\nthat she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,\\nto bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.\"\\n\\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,\\nand grew uncomfortable.  Her own behaviour had been so very improper!\\nShe was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.\\nIt was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without\\nthe smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,\\ninstantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance\\nof Box Hill seemed to exist.\\n\\n\"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,\\nthe Eltons,\" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.--\\nWhat! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt\\nthe engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--\\nshe dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of\\nhis behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he does,\" replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\\n\"`Smallridge!\\'--What does this mean?  What is all this?\"\\n\\n\"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge\\'s children--\\na dear friend of Mrs. Elton\\'s--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,\\nby the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even\\nof Mrs. Elton.  Only one page more.  I shall soon have done.\\nWhat a letter the man writes!\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding\\nher ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her.\\n`Dearer, much dearer than ever.\\'  I hope he may long continue to feel\\nall the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,\\nwith his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.\\'\\nCome, he knows himself there.  `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child\\nof good fortune.\\'--Those were Miss Woodhouse\\'s words, were they?--\\nAnd a fine ending--and there is the letter.  The child of good fortune!\\nThat was your name for him, was it?\"\\n\\n\"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;\\nbut still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better\\nof him for it.  I hope it does him some service with you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly it does.  He has had great faults, faults of\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his\\nopinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves:\\nbut still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,\\nand will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly\\nwith her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,\\nand acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle\\nthat it wants.  And now, let me talk to you of something else.\\nI have another person\\'s interest at present so much at heart,\\nthat I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.  Ever since I\\nleft you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on\\none subject.\"\\n\\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,\\nsuch as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,\\nhow to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father.  Emma\\'s answer was ready at the first word.\\n\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her.  She could never quit him.\"  Part only of this answer,\\nhowever, was admitted.  The impossibility of her quitting her father,\\nMr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility\\nof any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking\\nit over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce\\nMr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe\\nit feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer\\nhim to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,\\nthat such a transplantation would be a risk of her father\\'s comfort,\\nperhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse\\ntaken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.\\nBut the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted\\nhis dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as\\nher father\\'s happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield\\nto continue her home, it should be his likewise.\\n\\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own\\npassing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;\\nbut such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.\\nShe was sensible of all the affection it evinced.  She felt that,\\nin quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\\nof hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,\\nand in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,\\nto be borne with.  She promised to think of it, and advised him\\nto think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection\\ncould alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.  He had\\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;\\nhe had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,\\nto have his thoughts to himself.\\n\\n\"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma.  \"I am\\nsure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent\\nbefore you ask mine.\"\\n\\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,\\nto think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.\\n\\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view\\nin which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights\\nas heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.\\nThink she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;\\nand yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,\\nand found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\\ndislike of Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,\\nwhich at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\\nthe sister and the aunt.\\n\\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--\\nthe more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,\\ntheir mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion\\nfor herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--\\nSuch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\\ngiving increase of melancholy!\\n\\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every\\nblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.\\nThe delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,\\npoor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a\\ndistance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.\\nIn such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\\nbut for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.\\n\\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.\\nMr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\\nnot like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,\\nso truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\\nof Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men\\nin one year.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\\n\\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nIt might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\\n\\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella\\'s invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\\nHarriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.\\nMrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\\nunder her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister\\'s side,\\nEmma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\\nHarriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse\\'s carriage.--It was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\\n\\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley\\'s visits; now she\\ncould talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.\\n\\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma\\'s sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\\n\\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication\\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,\\nto crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.\\n\\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--\\nShe ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.\\nIt would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.\\n\\nShe went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\\nJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\\nThe fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\\nof their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\\nShe heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nMiss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\\nforward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\\nEmma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.\\nThere was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\nfeeling tone,\\n\\n\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible\\nfor me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being\\nso entirely without words.\"\\n\\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,\\nif the sound of Mrs. Elton\\'s voice from the sitting-room had not\\nchecked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest\\nshake of the hand.\\n\\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have\\nwished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.\\n\\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton\\'s thoughts,\\nand understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;\\nit was being in Miss Fairfax\\'s confidence, and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people.\\nEmma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;\\nand while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\\nto attend to the good old lady\\'s replies, she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\n\\n\"We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall\\nnot want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the\\nessential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\\nour apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully\\nshe writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated\\non her, had you gone.--But not a word more.  Let us be discreet--\\nquite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--\\nI forget the poem at this moment:\\n\\n        \"For when a lady\\'s in the case,\\n        \"You know all other things give place.\"\\n\\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word\\nto the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an\\'t I?  But I want\\nto set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see,\\nhas quite appeased her.\"\\n\\nAnd again, on Emma\\'s merely turning her head to look\\nat Mrs. Bates\\'s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,\\n\\n\"I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as\\na minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.\"\\n\\nEmma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\n\\n\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the\\nhighest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)\\nUpon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--\\nOh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"--\\nAnd when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,\\n\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;\\nnot a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;\\nPerry shall have all the credit.\"\\n\\n\"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nshe shortly afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill.\\nVery pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting.\\nThings did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon\\nthe spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might\\nbe mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one\\nto go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,\\nand exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--\\nIt must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\\nnot _one_ exception.\"\\n\\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,\\nfrom doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane\\'s prospects--\\nthat is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--\\nHow is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--\\nSuch a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--\\nCharming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--\\nsuch attention to Jane!\"--And from her great, her more than commonly\\nthankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed\\nthat there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,\\nfrom the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--\\nAfter a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,\\nMrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,\\nthat anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;\\nbut, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.\\nHe promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.\"\\n\\n\"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--\\nThat will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like\\nmorning visits, and Mr. Elton\\'s time is so engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning\\nto night.--There is no end of people\\'s coming to him, on some pretence\\nor other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,\\nare always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing\\nwithout him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,\\' I often say, `rather you than I.--\\nI do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,\\nif I had half so many applicants.\\'--Bad enough as it is, for I\\nabsolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe\\nI have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,\\nI assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.\"  And putting\\nup her hand to screen her words from Emma--\"A congratulatory visit,\\nyou know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily!--\\n\\n\"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\\nfrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together\\nin deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley\\'s right hand.\"\\n\\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \"Is Mr. Elton\\ngone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.\\nWeston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only\\nof those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing\\ntheir own way.\"\\n\\n\"Have not you mistaken the day?\" said Emma.  \"I am almost certain\\nthat the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley\\nwas at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\" was the abrupt answer,\\nwhich denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton\\'s side.--\\n\"I do believe,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish\\nthat ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\\ntalked of.\"\\n\\n\"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\\nthe only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you clever creature, that\\'s very true.  What a thinking brain\\nyou have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,\\nif we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity\\nwould produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,\\nthat _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--\\nnot a word, if you please.\"\\n\\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,\\nwas very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\\n\\nMr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity.\\n\\n\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--\\nBut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.\\nYou knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--\\nHere have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies\\na sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,\\nhow soon it may be wanted?\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,\\nand the walk he had had for nothing.\\n\\n\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found.\\nVery odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,\\nand the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home\\ntill one.\"\\n\\n\"Donwell!\" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E., you have not been\\nto Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, that\\'s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\\nto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--\\nI went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)\\nwhich made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home!\\nI assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message\\nfor me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--\\nVery extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.\\nPerhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--\\nMiss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you\\nexplain it?\"\\n\\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine,\" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do,) \"I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,\\nof all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect\\nto be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,\\nI am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--\\nand his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case:\\nand very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,\\nI have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I\\nwould not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard\\nfor any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds\\nher very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never\\nsent it.\"\\n\\n\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near\\nthe house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,\\nbut I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.\\nHe did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he\\ncould hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with\\nWilliam\\'s wants, but it really is of very great importance that _I_\\nshould see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,\\nof very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk\\nto no purpose.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.\\nIn all probability she was at this very time waited for there;\\nand Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression\\ntowards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\\n\\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined\\nto attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;\\nit gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,\\nto say,\\n\\n\"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.\\nHad you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been\\ntempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more\\nopenly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should\\ncertainly have been impertinent.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her\\nusual composure--\"there would have been no danger.  The danger\\nwould have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified\\nme more than by expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,\\n(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I\\nhave of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly\\nconsoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good\\nopinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a\\ndegree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.\\nI long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.\\nI feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly,\\nand taking her hand.  \"You owe me no apologies; and every body to\\nwhom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,\\nso delighted even--\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--\\nSo cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life\\nof deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\"\\n\\n\"Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\\nLet us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be\\ndone quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.\\nI hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--\\njust as I begin to know you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.\\nI am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\" replied Emma,\\nsmiling--\"but, excuse me, it must be thought of.\"\\n\\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\\n\\n\"You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own\\nto you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living\\nwith Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be\\nthree months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,\\nI imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--\\nOh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--\\nGood-bye, good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weston\\'s friends were all made happy by her safety;\\nand if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased\\nto Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.\\nShe had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.  She would\\nnot acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match\\nfor her, hereafter, with either of Isabella\\'s sons; but she was\\nconvinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.\\nIt would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--\\nand even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have\\nhis fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--\\nno one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it\\nwould be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,\\nshould not have their powers in exercise again.\\n\\n\"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\"\\nshe continued--\"like La Baronne d\\'Almane on La Comtesse d\\'Ostalis,\\nin Madame de Genlis\\' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see\\nher own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\"\\n\\n\"That is,\" replied Mr. Knightley, \"she will indulge her even more\\nthan she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.\\nIt will be the only difference.\"\\n\\n\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable\\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing\\nall my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.\\nI, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible\\ningratitude in me to be severe on them?\"\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied:  \"But I had the assistance of all\\nyour endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.\\nI doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--\\nMiss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well.\\nMy interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was\\nvery natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--\\nand I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done\\nin a disagreeable manner.  I do not believe I did you any good.\\nThe good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest\\naffection to me.  I could not think about you so much without doating\\non you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you were of use to me,\" cried Emma.  \"I was very often\\ninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.\\nI am very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is\\nto be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much\\nfor her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her\\nwhen she is thirteen.\"\\n\\n\"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one\\nof your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;\\npapa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor\\'s leave\\'--something which,\\nyou knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving\\nyou two bad feelings instead of one.\"\\n\\n\"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold\\nmy speeches in such affectionate remembrance.\"\\n\\n\"`Mr. Knightley.\\'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;\\' and,\\nfrom habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.\\nI want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"\\n\\n\"I remember once calling you `George,\\' in one of my amiable fits,\\nabout ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;\\nbut, as you made no objection, I never did it again.\"\\n\\n\"And cannot you call me `George\\' now?\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.\\'\\nI will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,\\nby calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\" she added presently,\\nlaughing and blushing--\"I will promise to call you once by your\\nChristian name.  I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess\\nwhere;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.\"\\n\\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one\\nimportant service which his better sense would have rendered her,\\nto the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all\\nher womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;\\nbut it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--\\nHarriet was very seldom mentioned between them.  This, on his side,\\nmight merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma\\nwas rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,\\nfrom some appearances, that their friendship were declining.\\nShe was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,\\nthey certainly should have corresponded more, and that her\\nintelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,\\non Isabella\\'s letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain\\nof being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little\\ninferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\\n\\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could\\nbe expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\\nwhich appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to\\nbe consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not\\nappear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--\\nIsabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet\\nhad not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have\\nescaped her.  Emma\\'s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on,\\nby Harriet\\'s being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be\\na month at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down\\nin August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.\\n\\n\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\"Here is his answer, if you like to see it.\"\\n\\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.\\nEmma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive\\nto know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing\\nthat her friend was unmentioned.\\n\\n\"John enters like a brother into my happiness,\" continued Mr. Knightley,\\n\"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\\nlikewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\\nmaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\\ncool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"\\n\\n\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read\\nthe letter.  \"I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he\\nconsiders the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,\\nbut that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy\\nof your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing\\nto bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma, he means no such thing.  He only means--\"\\n\\n\"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\"\\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\"much less, perhaps,\\nthan he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve\\non the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Emma, my dear Emma--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your\\nbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in\\nthe secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much\\nfarther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,\\nall the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit\\non mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma\\' with him at once.--\\nHis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\\nto be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John\\'s letter--\\ndid you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take\\nhim wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing\\nsomething of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into\\nmy feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious\\nof any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\\nhim at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--\\nBut it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I\\nwas staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play\\nwith the children quite so much as usual.  I remember one evening\\nthe poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.\\'\"\\n\\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons\\'\\nreception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse\\'s visits, Emma having it in view\\nthat her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,\\nresolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--\\nBut how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself\\nto do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley\\'s absence, or when it\\ncame to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must\\nhave put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,\\nand follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced\\nto speak, and to speak cheerfully too.  She must not make it a more\\ndecided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits\\nshe could command, she prepared him first for something strange,\\nand then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation\\ncould be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with\\nno difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--\\nshe and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield\\nwould receive the constant addition of that person\\'s company\\nwhom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,\\nbest in the world.\\n\\nPoor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,\\nof having always said she would never marry, and assured that it\\nwould be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of\\npoor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung\\nabout him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that\\nhe must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:\\nbut she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;\\nshe was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\\nfor the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\\nthe happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once\\ngot used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--\\nHe would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want\\nto consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,\\nwho so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--\\nWho so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he\\nlike to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.\\nMr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see\\nhim every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could\\nnot they go on as they had done?\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--\\nTo Emma\\'s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley\\'s,\\nwhose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;\\nand he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--\\nThey had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters\\nof the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,\\non the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto Mr. Woodhouse\\'s mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--\\nin another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad\\nif the marriage did take place.\\n\\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;\\nbut she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had\\nno scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard\\nfor Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;\\nand it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable\\na connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,\\nso peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\\nas if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own\\nhome for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear\\nwith Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--\\nThe difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always\\nfelt in her husband\\'s plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank\\nand Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had\\nbeen a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than\\nby herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject\\nbetter than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves;\\nthe young people will find a way.\"  But here there was nothing to be\\nshifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,\\nall open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\\nIt was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,\\nand without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\\n\\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing\\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would\\nsoon have outgrown its first set of caps.\\n\\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;\\nand Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes\\nwere enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--\\nHe saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all\\nthe constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;\\nand by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\\nhad always foreseen it.\\n\\n\"It is to be a secret, I conclude,\" said he.  \"These matters are\\nalways a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.\\nOnly let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has\\nany suspicion.\"\\n\\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on\\nthat point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,\\nhis eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,\\nit passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,\\nimmediately afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were\\nprepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known\\nat Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking\\nof themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,\\nwith great sagacity.\\n\\nIn general, it was a very well approved match.  Some might think him,\\nand others might think her, the most in luck.  One set might\\nrecommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield\\nfor the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements\\namong their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious\\nobjection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,\\nthe surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton\\ncared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the\\nyoung lady\\'s pride would now be contented;\" and supposed \"she had\\nalways meant to catch Knightley if she could;\" and, on the point\\nof living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"--\\nBut Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!\\npoor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;\\nfor, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--\\nHow could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--\\nnot in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--\\nPoor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.\\nOh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on\\nevery thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry\\nthat she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,\\nliving together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple\\nGrove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end\\nof the first quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nTime passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London\\nwould be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking\\nof it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\\ngrieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts\\nwere put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;\\nand then, in a graver tone, began with,\\n\\n\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"\\n\\n\"Good or bad?\" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\\n\\n\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying\\nnot to smile.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said he, composing his features, \"I am very much afraid,\\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which\\npleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\"\\n\\n\"There is one subject,\" he replied, \"I hope but one, on which\\nwe do not think alike.\"  He paused a moment, again smiling,\\nwith his eyes fixed on her face.  \"Does nothing occur to you?--\\nDo not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.\"\\n\\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\\nthough she knew not what.\\n\\n\"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\" cried he.\\n\"You have, I believe, and know the whole.\"\\n\\n\"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\"\\n\\n\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.\\nHarriet Smith marries Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--\\nand her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"\\nbut her lips were closed.\\n\\n\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\\nMartin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago.\"\\n\\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\\n\\n\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\\nthe same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make\\none or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,\\nwe need not talk much on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself.\\n\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\\nbut I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean\\nto say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot\\nmean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,\\nthat he intends it.\"\\n\\n\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\\nbut determined decision, \"and been accepted.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\\nexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\\nmust be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing;\\nmake this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.\\nI never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,\\nI assure you.--How--how has it been possible?\"\\n\\n\"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,\\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting\\nto send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,\\nand was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley\\'s.\\nThey were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley\\'s. The party\\nwas to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.\\nMy friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;\\nwere all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with\\nthem the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit\\n(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;\\nand certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,\\nas happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday\\'s coach,\\nand was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report\\nhis proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\\nThis is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.\\nYour friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--\\nShe will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman\\'s\\nlanguage can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only\\nin the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin\\'s heart seemed\\nfor _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\\nwithout its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\\nbox at Astley\\'s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\\nand little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\nrather uneasy.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,\\nshe was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\\nof happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.\\nHer silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,\\nhe added,\\n\\n\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make\\nyou unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.\\nHis situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies\\nyour friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better\\nof him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would\\ndelight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,\\nwhich is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\\nabout William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself\\nnot to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\\n\\n\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think\\nHarriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_.\\nIn respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.\\nI have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.\\nYou cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\\nunprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;\\n\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,\\nnot likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her.\"\\n\\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,\\nI believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\n_accepted_ him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--\\nDid not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;\\nof business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,\\nin the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not\\nHarriet\\'s hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox.\"\\n\\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\\'s feelings,\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on Harriet\\'s side, so fresh the sound of those words,\\nspoken with such emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think\\nof Robert Martin,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove, in some measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.\\n\\n\"Do you dare say this?\" cried Mr. Knightley.  \"Do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\\nWhat do you deserve?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put\\nup with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,\\ndirect answer.  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms\\non which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?\"\\n\\n\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\\nnothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\\na proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do.  He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends.  Could I\\nmention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?\\nI assured him that I could not.  Then, he said, he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\n\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"\\n\\n\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"\\n\\n\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet\\'s good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake,\\nand for Robert Martin\\'s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.\\nI have often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that\\nI did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor Martin\\'s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--\\nMuch of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! poor Harriet!\"\\n\\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved.\\n\\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;\\nand till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed\\nand reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.\\n\\nHer father\\'s business was to announce James\\'s being gone out to put\\nthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;\\nand she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\\n\\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of Harriet\\'s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to\\ngrow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.\\n\\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\\nof them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a Harriet!\\n\\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\\nbe a pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\\n\\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nMr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,\\nmystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.\\nShe could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.\\n\\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\\nnot always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\\nand, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,\\nor poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.\\n\\nThey arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.\\n\\n\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.  \"I was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"\\n\\nIn half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad\\nto see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling,\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\\nand having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\\nwhich she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\\nand of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.\\nWhen Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\\nwas fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\\nor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\\nand say,\\n\\n\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of Mrs. Weston\\'s letters.  I hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.\\nI am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\\nyou joy in person.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\\n\\n\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\\n\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\\nMrs. Weston doat upon her.\"\\n\\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named\\nthe name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing.\\n\\n\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"\\n\\n\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,\\nyou had none.\"\\n\\n\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--\\nit would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,\\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--\\nIt would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle\\'s being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.\\nWhen the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,\\nand continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,\\nI am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--\\nTill this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.\\nDo not you pity me?\"\\n\\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought, he cried,\\n\\n\"Ah! by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\\nthe moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"  He paused.--She coloured\\nand laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--\\nI assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"\\n\\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown Jane, and his next words were,\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--\\nand yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.\\nIt is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--\\na most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--\\nJust colour enough for beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not\\nI remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--\\nWhen we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could\\nnot help saying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--\\nI am sure it was a consolation to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?\\nI was the most miserable wretch!\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.  I am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking\\nus all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell\\nyou the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation.  I think there is a little likeness between us.\"\\n\\nHe bowed.\\n\\n\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of\\ntrue sensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly.  \"No, not true on your side.  You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.\\nLook at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn\\nof her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--\\nYou will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunt\\'s jewels.  They are to be\\nnew set.  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.\\nWill not it be beautiful in her dark hair?\"\\n\\n\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,\\nthat he gratefully burst out,\\n\\n\"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such\\nexcellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.\\nI should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"\\n\\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,\\nfrom the infant\\'s appearing not quite well.  She believed she had\\nbeen foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for Mr. Perry.  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,\\nbut Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,\\nhowever, the child had been perfectly well again.  This was\\nher history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,\\nand only regretted that she had not done it.  \"She should always send\\nfor Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,\\nwere it only for a moment.  She could not be too soon alarmed,\\nnor send for Perry too often.  It was a pity, perhaps, that he\\nhad not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry\\nhad seen it.\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\\n\\n\"Perry!\" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax\\'s eye.  \"My friend Mr. Perry!  What are they saying\\nabout Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does\\nhe travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"\\n\\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined\\nin the laugh, it was evident from Jane\\'s countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\\n\\n\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\" he cried.  \"I can never think\\nof it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.\\nI see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.\\nLook at her.  Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage\\nof her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to\\nnothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\"\\n\\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,\\nlow, yet steady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--\\nThey _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"\\n\\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;\\nbut Emma\\'s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on\\nleaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,\\nshe felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never\\nbeen more sensible of Mr. Knightley\\'s high superiority of character.\\nThe happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.\\nA very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\\nthan she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--\\nthat Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\\n\\nHarriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\\nand self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\\nher friend\\'s approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\\nHarriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nAstley\\'s, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight.  But what did such particulars explain?--\\nThe fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\\nalways liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\\nto Emma.\\n\\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet\\'s parentage became known.\\nShe proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\\nof gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\\nIt was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many\\na gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nMr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--\\nThe stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,\\nwould have been a stain indeed.\\n\\nNo objection was raised on the father\\'s side; the young man was\\ntreated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became\\nacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend.  She had no doubt\\nof Harriet\\'s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\\nand in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\\nof security, stability, and improvement.  She would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.\\nShe would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.\\nShe would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,\\nto yield only to herself.\\n\\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--\\nThe intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\\nto be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,\\nnatural manner.\\n\\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,\\nas no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood\\nbefore them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\\nscarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\\naltar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,\\nthe latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.\\n\\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\\n\\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,\\nby Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage\\nought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,\\nto allow them the fortnight\\'s absence in a tour to the seaside,\\nwhich was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,\\nwere agreed in approving it.  But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse\\nto be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their\\nmarriage but as a distant event.\\n\\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\\nwere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\\nHe began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\\na very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.\\nStill, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\\nthat his daughter\\'s courage failed.  She could not bear to see\\nhim suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though\\nher understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the\\nMr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.\\n\\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nMrs. Weston\\'s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.  Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law\\'s protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.\\nWhile either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\\nBut Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the\\nfirst week in November.\\n\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert\\nMartin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\\n\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.\\n\\n\\nFINIS\\n',\n",
              " '[The Parent\\'s Assistant, by Maria Edgeworth]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ORPHANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the ruins of the castle of Rossmore, in Ireland, is a small cabin,\\r\\nin which there once lived a widow and her four children.  As long as she\\r\\nwas able to work, she was very industrious, and was accounted the best\\r\\nspinner in the parish; but she overworked herself at last, and fell ill,\\r\\nso that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do, and was obliged\\r\\nto give it up to her eldest daughter, Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was at this time about twelve years old.  One evening she was\\r\\nsitting at the foot of her mother\\'s bed spinning, and her little brothers\\r\\nand sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk\\r\\nfor supper.  \"Bless them, the poor young creatures!\" said the widow, who,\\r\\nas she lay on her bed, which she knew must be her deathbed, was thinking\\r\\nof what would become of her children after she was gone.  Mary stopped\\r\\nher wheel, for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her\\r\\nmother, and would hinder her from going to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No need to stop the wheel, Mary, dear, for me,\" said her mother, \"I was\\r\\nnot asleep; nor is it THAT which keeps me from sleep.  But don\\'t overwork\\r\\nyourself, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no fear of that,\" replied Mary; \"I\\'m strong and hearty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So was I once,\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so you will be again, I hope,\" said Mary, \"when the fine weather\\r\\ncomes again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fine weather will never come again to me,\" said her mother.  \"\\'Tis a\\r\\nfolly, Mary, to hope for that; but what I hope is, that you\\'ll find some\\r\\nfriend--some help--orphans as you\\'ll soon all of you be.  And one thing\\r\\ncomforts my heart, even as I AM lying here, that not a soul in the wide\\r\\nworld I am leaving has to complain of me.  Though poor I have lived\\r\\nhonest, and I have brought you up to be the same, Mary; and I am sure the\\r\\nlittle ones will take after you; for you\\'ll be good to them--as good to\\r\\nthem as you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the children, who had finished eating their suppers, came round the\\r\\nbed, to listen to what their mother was saying.  She was tired of\\r\\nspeaking, for she was very weak; but she took their little hands, as they\\r\\nlaid them on the bed and joining them all together, she said, \"Bless you,\\r\\ndears; bless you; love and help one another all you can.  Good night!--\\r\\ngood-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took the children away to their bed, for she saw that their mother\\r\\nwas too ill to say more; but Mary did not herself know how ill she was.\\r\\nHer mother never spoke rightly afterwards, but talked in a confused way\\r\\nabout some debts, and one in particular, which she owed to a\\r\\nschoolmistress for Mary\\'s schooling; and then she charged Mary to go and\\r\\npay it, because she was not able to GO IN with it.  At the end of the\\r\\nweek she was dead and buried, and the orphans were left alone in their\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two youngest girls, Peggy and Nancy, were six and seven years old.\\r\\nEdmund was not yet nine, but he was a stout-grown, healthy boy, and well\\r\\ndisposed to work.  He had been used to bring home turf from the bog on\\r\\nhis back, to lead cart-horses, and often to go on errands for gentlemen\\'s\\r\\nfamilies, who paid him a sixpence or a shilling, according to the\\r\\ndistance which he went, so that Edmund, by some or other of these little\\r\\nemployments, was, as he said, likely enough to earn his bread; and he\\r\\ntold Mary to have a good heart, for that he should every year grow able\\r\\nto do more and more, and that he should never forget his mother\\'s words\\r\\nwhen she last gave him her blessing, and joined their hands all together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Peggy and Nancy, it was little that they could do; but they were\\r\\ngood children, and Mary, when she considered that so much depended upon\\r\\nher, was resolved to exert herself to the utmost.  Her first care was to\\r\\npay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her, for which she left\\r\\nmoney done up carefully in separate papers.  When all these were paid\\r\\naway, there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a\\r\\nyear\\'s schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the\\r\\nschoolmistress in a neighbouring village.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately, but\\r\\nin this she was disappointed.  Mr. Harvey, the gentleman on whose estate\\r\\nshe lived, was in England, and, in his absence, all was managed by a Mr.\\r\\nHopkins, an agent, who was a HARD MAN.*  The driver came to Mary about a\\r\\nweek after her mother\\'s death, and told her that the rent must be brought\\r\\nin the next day, and that she must leave the cabin, for a new tenant was\\r\\ncoming into it; that she was too young to have a house to herself, and\\r\\nthat the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her\\r\\nand her brother and her sisters in for charity\\'s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\n*A hard-hearted man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if\\r\\nshe had not brought upon herself the ill-will of Miss Alice, the agent\\'s\\r\\ndaughter.  Mary, it is true, had refused to give Miss Alice a goat upon\\r\\nwhich she had set her fancy; but this was the only offence of which she\\r\\nhad been guilty, and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the\\r\\ngoat\\'s milk, which was the only thing she then liked to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary went immediately to Mr. Hopkins, the agent, to pay her rent; and she\\r\\nbegged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin; but this he\\r\\nrefused.  It was now September 25th, and he said that the new tenant must\\r\\ncome in on the 29th, so that she must quit it directly.  Mary could not\\r\\nbear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her\\r\\nbrother and sisters in FOR CHARITY\\'S SAKE; for the neighbours were all\\r\\npoor enough themselves.  So she bethought herself that she might find\\r\\nshelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her\\r\\nbrother, in better times, had often played at hide and seek.  The kitchen\\r\\nand two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well; and a\\r\\nlittle thatch, she thought, would make them comfortable through the\\r\\nwinter.  The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in\\r\\nthere, upon her paying him half a guinea in hand, and promising to pay\\r\\nthe same yearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto these lodgings the orphans now removed, taking with them two\\r\\nbedsteads, a stool, chair and a table, a sort of press, which contained\\r\\nwhat little clothes they had, and a chest in which they had two hundred\\r\\nof meal.  The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable\\r\\nneighbours, who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf\\r\\nwhat would make it last through the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese children were well thought of and pitied, because their mother was\\r\\nknown to have been all her life honest and industrious.  \"Sure,\" says one\\r\\nof the neighbours, \"we can do no less than give a helping hand to the\\r\\npoor orphans, that are so ready to help themselves.\"  So one helped to\\r\\nthatch the room in which they were to sleep, and another took their cow\\r\\nto graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk; and\\r\\none and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes\\r\\nand buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half-guinea which Mr. Hopkins, the agent, required for letting Mary\\r\\ninto the castle, was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress,\\r\\nto whom above a guinea was due.  Mary went to her, and took her goat\\r\\nalong with her, and offered it in part of payment of the debt, but the\\r\\nschoolmistress would not receive the goat. She said that she could afford\\r\\nto wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it; that she knew her to\\r\\nbe an honest, industrious little girl, and she would trust her with more\\r\\nthan a guinea.  Mary thanked her; and she was glad to take the goat home\\r\\nagain, as she was very fond of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing now settled in their house, they went every day regularly to work;\\r\\nMaud spun nine cuts a day, besides doing all that was to be done in the\\r\\nhouse; Edmund got fourpence a day by his work; and Peggy and Annie earned\\r\\ntwopence apiece at the paper-mills near Navan, where they were employed\\r\\nto sort rags, and to cut them into small pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done work one day, Annie went to the master of the paper-\\r\\nmill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper\\r\\nwhich were lying on the press.  She offered a penny for the paper; but\\r\\nthe master would not take anything from her, but gave her the paper when\\r\\nhe found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother\\'s grave.\\r\\nAnnie and Peggy cut out the garland, and Mary, when it was finished, went\\r\\nalong with them and Edmund to put it up.  It was just a month after their\\r\\nmother\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened, at the time the orphans were putting up this garland, that\\r\\ntwo young ladies, who were returning home after their evening walk,\\r\\nstopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the\\r\\nsetting sun cast upon the window of the church.  As the ladies were\\r\\nstanding at the gate, they heard a voice near them crying, \"O, mother!\\r\\nmother! are you gone for ever?\"  They could not see anyone, so they\\r\\nwalked softly round to the other side of the church, and there they saw\\r\\nMary kneeling beside a grave, on which her brothers and sisters were\\r\\nhanging their white garlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near\\r\\nthem; but Mary did not know anybody was passing, for her face was hid in\\r\\nher hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline (so these ladies were called) would not disturb the\\r\\npoor children; but they stopped in the village to inquire about them.  It\\r\\nwas at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped, and she gave\\r\\nthem a good account of these orphans.  She particularly commended Mary\\'s\\r\\nhonesty, in having immediately paid all her mother\\'s debts to the utmost\\r\\nfarthing, as far as her money would go.  She told the ladies how Mary had\\r\\nbeen turned out of her house, and how she had offered her goat, of which\\r\\nshe was very fond, to discharge a debt due for her schooling; and, in\\r\\nshort, the schoolmistress, who had known Mary for several years, spoke so\\r\\nwell of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old\\r\\ncastle of Rossmore to see her the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they went there, they found the room in which the children lived as\\r\\nclean and neat as such a ruined place could be made.  Edmund was out\\r\\nworking with a farmer, Mary was spinning, and her little sisters were\\r\\nmeasuring out some bogberries, of which they had gathered a basketful,\\r\\nfor sale.  Isabella, after telling Mary what an excellent character she\\r\\nhad heard of her, inquired what it was she most wanted; and Mary said\\r\\nthat she had just worked up all her flax, and she was most in want of\\r\\nmore flax for her wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax, and\\r\\nCaroline bought the bogberries from the little girls, and gave them money\\r\\nenough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting, as Mary said that\\r\\nshe could teach them how to knit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supply of flax, which Isabella sent the next day, was of great\\r\\nservice to Mary, as it kept her in employment for above a month; and when\\r\\nshe sold the yarn which she had spun with it, she had money enough to buy\\r\\nsome warm flannel for winter wear.  Besides spinning well, she had\\r\\nlearned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly, and Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline employed her to work for them; by which she earned a great deal\\r\\nmore than she could by spinning.  At her leisure hours she taught her\\r\\nsisters to read and write; and Edmund, with part of the money which he\\r\\nearned by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a\\r\\nlittle arithmetic.  When the winter nights came on, he used to light his\\r\\nrush candles for Mary to work by.  He had gathered and stripped a good\\r\\nprovision of rushes in the month of August, and a neighbour gave him\\r\\ngrease to dip them in.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, just as he had lighted his candles, a footman came in, who\\r\\nwas sent by Isabella with some plain work to Mary.  This servant was an\\r\\nEnglishman, and he was but newly come over to Ireland.  The rush candles\\r\\ncaught his attention; for he had never seen any of them before, as he\\r\\ncame from a part of England where they were not used.  Edmund, who was\\r\\nready to oblige, and proud that his candles were noticed showed the\\r\\nEnglishman how they were made, and gave him a bundle of rushes.*\\r\\n\\r\\n[*\"The proper species of rush,\" says White, in his \\'Natural History of\\r\\nSelborne,\\' \"seems to be the Juncus effusus, or common soft rush, which is\\r\\nto be found in moist pastures, by the sides of streams, and under\\r\\nhedges.  These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer, but\\r\\nmay be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn.  The\\r\\nlargest and longest are the best.  Decayed labourers, women, and children\\r\\nmake it their business to procure and prepare them.  As soon as they are\\r\\ncut, they must be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwise they\\r\\nwill dry and shrink, and the peel will not run.  When these junci are\\r\\nthus far prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take\\r\\nthe dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the sun.  Some\\r\\naddress is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or\\r\\ngrease; but this knack is also to be attained by practice.  A pound of\\r\\ncommon grease may be procured for fourpence, and about six pounds of\\r\\ngrease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought\\r\\nfor one shilling; so that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use,\\r\\nwill cost three shillings.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance,\\r\\nand remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund.  Whenever his\\r\\nmaster wanted to send a messenger anywhere, Gilbert (for that was the\\r\\nservant\\'s name) always employed his little friend Edmund, whom, upon\\r\\nfurther acquaintance, he liked better and better.  He found that Edmund\\r\\nwas both quick and exact in executing commissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after he had waited a great while at a gentleman\\'s house for an\\r\\nanswer to a letter, he was so impatient to get home that he ran off\\r\\nwithout it.  When he was questioned by Gilbert why he did not bring an\\r\\nanswer, he did not attempt to make any excuse; he did not say, \"There was\\r\\nno answer, please your honour,\" or, \"They bid me not to wait,\" etc.; but\\r\\nhe told exactly the truth; and though Gilbert scolded him for being so\\r\\nimpatient as not to wait, yet his telling the truth was more to the boy\\'s\\r\\nadvantage than any excuse he could have made.  After this he was always\\r\\nbelieved when he said, \"There was no answer,\" or, \"They bid me not wait\";\\r\\nfor Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being\\r\\nscolded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to\\r\\ntheir strength and abilities; and they went on in this manner for three\\r\\nyears.  With what Mary got by her spinning and plain work, and Edmund by\\r\\nleading of cart-horses, going on errands, etc., and with little Peggy and\\r\\nAnne\\'s earnings, the family contrived to live comfortably.  Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline often visited them, and sometimes gave them clothes, and\\r\\nsometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting; and these\\r\\nchildren did not EXPECT, that because the ladies did something for them,\\r\\nthey should do everything.  They did not grow idle or wasteful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Edmund was about twelve years old, his friend Gilbert sent for him\\r\\none day, and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy\\r\\nin the house to assist him, and that his master told him he might choose\\r\\none in the neighbourhood.  Several were anxious to get into such a good\\r\\nplace:  but Gilbert said that he preferred Edmund before them all,\\r\\nbecause he knew him to be an industrious, honest, good natured lad, who\\r\\nalways told the truth.  So Edmund went into service at the vicarage; and\\r\\nhis master was the father of Isabella and Caroline.  He found his new way\\r\\nof life very pleasant; for he was well fed, well clothed, and well\\r\\ntreated; and he every day learned more of his business, in which at first\\r\\nhe was rather awkward.  He was mindful to do all that Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nrequired of him; and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that\\r\\nthey could not help liking him.  But there was one thing which was at\\r\\nfirst rather disagreeable to him:  he was obliged to wear shoes and\\r\\nstockings, and they hurt his feet.  Besides this, when he waited at\\r\\ndinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow-servants laughed\\r\\nat him.  He told his sister Mary of his distress, and she made for him,\\r\\nafter many trials, a pair of cloth shoes, with soles of platted hemp.*\\r\\nIn these he could walk without making the least noise; and as these shoes\\r\\ncould not be worn out of doors, he was always sure to change them before\\r\\nhe went out; and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[*The author has seen a pair of shoes, such as here described, made in a\\r\\nfew hours.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon remarked by the men-servants that he had left off clumping so\\r\\nheavily, and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the\\r\\nstairs or passages with his shoes.  When he was praised for these things,\\r\\nhe said it was his sister Mary who should be thanked, and not he; and he\\r\\nshowed the shoes which she had made for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella\\'s maid bespoke a pair immediately, and sent Mary a piece of\\r\\npretty calico for the outside.  The last-maker made a last for her, and\\r\\nover this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight.  Her brother advised her to\\r\\ntry platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that\\r\\nthis looked more neat than the hemp soles, and was likely to last longer.\\r\\nShe platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch\\r\\nthick, and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe.\\r\\nWhen they were finished they fitted well, and the maid showed them to her\\r\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary\\'s ingenuity and\\r\\nkindness to her brother, that they bespoke from her two dozen of these\\r\\nshoes, and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of, and\\r\\ngalloon for the binding.  When the shoes were completed, Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance, and got\\r\\nthree shillings a pair for them.  The young ladies, as soon as they had\\r\\ncollected the money, walked to the old castle, where they found\\r\\neverything neat and clean as usual.  They had great pleasure in giving to\\r\\nthis industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity, which she received\\r\\nwith some surprise and more gratitude.  They advised her to continue the\\r\\nshoemaking trade, as they found the shoes were liked, and they knew that\\r\\nthey could have a sale for them at the Repository in Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, encouraged by these kind friends, went on with her little\\r\\nmanufacture with increased activity.  Peggy and Anne platted the\\r\\npackthread, and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her.\\r\\nEdmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning, provided he\\r\\nwas back again before eight o\\'clock.  It was summer time, and he got up\\r\\nearly, because he liked to go home to see his sisters, and he took his\\r\\nshare in the manufactory.  It was his business to hammer the soles flat:\\r\\nand as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so\\r\\nmuch cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work, that the hour of his\\r\\narrival was always an hour of joy to the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had presently employment enough upon her hands.  Orders came to her\\r\\nfor shoes from many families in the neighbourhood, and she could not get\\r\\nthem finished fast enough.  She, however, in the midst of her hurry,\\r\\nfound time to make a very pretty pair, with neat roses, as a present for\\r\\nher schoolmistress, who, now that she saw her pupil in a good way of\\r\\nbusiness, consented to receive the amount of her old debt.  Several of\\r\\nthe children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of\\r\\nMary\\'s present, and went to the little manufactory at Rossmore Castle, to\\r\\nfind out how these shoes were made.  Some went from curiosity, others\\r\\nfrom idleness; but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed\\r\\nwhilst busy at work, they longed to take some share in what was going\\r\\nforward.  One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles;\\r\\nanother helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings; and all who could\\r\\nget employment were pleased, for the idle ones were shoved out of the\\r\\nway.  It became a custom with the children of the village to resort to\\r\\nthe old castle at their play hours; and it was surprising to see how much\\r\\nwas done by ten or twelve of them, each doing but a little at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very\\r\\nearly, and they were busy at their work, all sitting round the meal\\r\\nchest, which served them for a table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hands must be washed,\" said George, a little boy who came running in;\\r\\n\"I ran so fast that I might be in time, to go to work along with you all,\\r\\nthat I tumbled down, and look how I have dirtied my hands.  Most haste\\r\\nworst speed.  My hands must be washed before I can do anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst George was washing his hands, two other little children, who had\\r\\njust finished their morning\\'s work, came to him to beg that he would blow\\r\\nsome soap bubbles for them, and they were all three eagerly blowing\\r\\nbubbles, and watching them mount into the air, when suddenly they were\\r\\nstartled by a noise as loud as thunder.  They were in a sort of outer\\r\\ncourt of the castle, next to the room in which all their companions were\\r\\nat work, and they ran precipitately into the room, exclaiming, \"Did you\\r\\nhear that noise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I heard a clap of thunder,\" said Mary, \"but why do you look so\\r\\nfrightened?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she finished speaking, another and a louder noise, and the walls round\\r\\nabout them shook.  The children turned pale and stood motionless; but\\r\\nEdmund threw down his hammer, and ran out to see what was the matter.\\r\\nMary followed him, and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at\\r\\nthe farthest side of the castle had fallen down, and this was the cause\\r\\nof the prodigious noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe part of the castle in which they lived seemed, as Edmund said, to be\\r\\nperfectly safe; but the children of the village were terrified, and\\r\\nthinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly, they ran to\\r\\ntheir homes as fast as they could.  Edmund, who was a courageous lad, and\\r\\nproud of showing his courage, laughed at their cowardice; but Mary, who\\r\\nwas very prudent, persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason, who\\r\\nwas building at his master\\'s, to come and give his opinion, whether their\\r\\npart of the castle was safe to live in or not.  The mason came, and gave\\r\\nit as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the\\r\\nwinter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year.  Mary was\\r\\nsorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was,\\r\\nhaving lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother\\'s\\r\\ndeath, which was now nearly four years; but she determined to look out\\r\\nfor some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the\\r\\nrent of a comfortable cabin.  Without losing any time, she went to the\\r\\nvillage that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage, for\\r\\nshe wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her\\r\\nbrother, and to the ladies who had been so kind to her.  She found that\\r\\nthere was one newly built house in this village unoccupied; it belonged\\r\\nto Mr. Harvey, her landlord, who was still in England; it was slated, and\\r\\nneatly fitted up inside; but the rent of it was six guineas a year, and\\r\\nthis was far above what Mary could afford to pay.  Three guineas a year\\r\\nshe thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage.\\r\\nBesides, she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr. Harvey for\\r\\nthis house, and she knew that Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was not her friend;\\r\\ntherefore she despaired of getting it.  There was no other to be had in\\r\\nthis village.  Her brother was still more vexed than she was, that she\\r\\ncould not find a place near him.  He offered to give a guinea yearly\\r\\ntowards the rent out of his wages; and Mr. Gilbert spoke about it for him\\r\\nto the steward, and inquired whether, amongst any of those who had given\\r\\nin proposals, there might not be one who would be content with a part of\\r\\nthe house, and who would join with Mary in paying the rent.  None could\\r\\nbe found but a woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for\\r\\ngoing to law about every trifle with his neighbours.  Mary did not choose\\r\\nto have anything to do with these people.  She did not like to speak\\r\\neither to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it, because she was not of an\\r\\nencroaching temper; and when they had done so much for her, she would\\r\\nhave been ashamed to beg for more.  She returned home to the old castle,\\r\\nmortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy, who she knew\\r\\nexpected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village\\r\\nnear their brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad news for you, Peggy,\" cried she, as soon as she got home.  \"And bad\\r\\nnews for you, Mary,\" replied her sisters, who looked very sorrowful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your poor goat is dead,\" replied Peggy.  \"There she is, yonder, lying\\r\\nunder the great corner stone; you can just see her leg.  We cannot lift\\r\\nthe stone from off her, it is so heavy.  Betsy [one of the neighbour\\'s\\r\\ngirls] says she remembers, when she came to us to work early this\\r\\nmorning, she saw the goat rubbing itself, and butting with its horns\\r\\nagainst that old tottering chimney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many\\'s the time,\" said Mary, \"that I have driven the poor thing away\\r\\nfrom that place; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly\\r\\nstone down upon her at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goat, who had long been the favourite of Mary and her sisters, was\\r\\nlamented by them all.  When Edmund came, he helped them to move the great\\r\\nstone from off the poor animal, who was crushed so as to be a terrible\\r\\nsight.  As they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat,\\r\\nAnne found an odd-looking piece of money, which seemed neither like a\\r\\nhalfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are more, a great many more of them,\" cried Peggy; and upon\\r\\nsearching amongst the rubbish, they discovered a small iron pot, which\\r\\nseemed as if it had been filled with these coins, as a vast number of\\r\\nthem were found about the spot where it fell.  On examining these coins,\\r\\nEdmund thought that several of them looked like gold, and the girls\\r\\nexclaimed with great joy--\"Oh, Mary! Mary! this is come to us just in\\r\\nright time--now you can pay for the slated house.  Never was anything so\\r\\nlucky!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary, though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been\\r\\nable to pay for the house, observed that they could not honestly touch\\r\\nany of this treasure, as it belonged to the owner of the castle.  Edmund\\r\\nagreed with her, that they ought to carry it all immediately to Mr.\\r\\nHopkins, the agent. Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said, and\\r\\nthey begged to go along with her and their brother, to take the coins to\\r\\nMr. Hopkins.  On their way they stopped at the vicarage, to show the\\r\\ntreasure to Mr. Gilbert, who took it to the young ladies, Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline, and told them how it had been found.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not only by their superior riches, but it is yet more by their\\r\\nsuperior knowledge, that persons in the higher rank of life may assist\\r\\nthose in a lower condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella, who had some knowledge of chemistry, discovered, by touching\\r\\nthe coins with nitric acid, that several of them were of gold, and\\r\\nconsequently of great value.  Caroline also found out that many of the\\r\\ncoins were very valuable as curiosities.  She recollected her father\\'s\\r\\nhaving shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king\\'s\\r\\nreign, in \"Rapin\\'s History of England;\" and upon comparing these\\r\\nimpressions with the coins found by the orphans, she perceived that many\\r\\nof them were of the reign of Henry the Seventh, which, from their\\r\\nscarcity, were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline, knowing something of the character of Mr. Hopkins,\\r\\nthe agent, had the precaution to count the coins, and to mark each of\\r\\nthem with a cross, so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked\\r\\neye, though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass.  They\\r\\nalso begged that their father, who was well acquainted with Mr. Harvey,\\r\\nthe gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged, to write to him, and tell\\r\\nhim how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had\\r\\nfound.  The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty\\r\\nguineas.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle, as Mary and\\r\\nher sisters were sitting at their work, there came hobbling in an old\\r\\nwoman, leaning on a crab stick, that seemed to have been newly cut.  She\\r\\nhad a broken tobacco-pipe in her mouth; her head was wrapped up in two\\r\\nlarge red and blue handkerchiefs, with their crooked corners hanging far\\r\\ndown over the back of her neck, no shoes on her broad feet, nor stockings\\r\\non her many-coloured legs.  Her petticoat was jagged at the bottom, and\\r\\nthe skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders, to serve instead of a\\r\\ncloak, which she had sold for whisky.  This old woman was well known\\r\\namongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope:*  because she had,\\r\\nfor many years, been in the habit of groping in old castles, and in\\r\\nmoats,** and at the bottom of a round tower*** in the neighbourhood, in\\r\\nsearch of treasure.  In her youth she had heard someone talking, in a\\r\\nwhisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that before many\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"St. Patrick\\'s days should come about,\\r\\n      There would be found\\r\\n      A treasure under ground,\\r\\n      By one within twenty miles round.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis prophecy made a deep impression upon her.  She also dreamed of it\\r\\nthree times:  and as the dream, she thought, was a sure token that the\\r\\nprophecy was to come true, she, from that time forwards, gave up her\\r\\nspinning-wheel and her knitting, and could think of nothing but hunting\\r\\nfor the treasure, that was to be found by one \"within twenty miles\\r\\nround.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[*Goody is not a word used in Ireland.  Collyogh is the Irish appellation\\r\\nof an old woman:  but as Collyogh might sound strangely to English ears,\\r\\nwe have translated it by the word Goody.\\r\\n**What are in Ireland called moats, are, in England, called Danish\\r\\nmounds, or barrows.\\r\\n***Near Kells, in Ireland, there is a round tower, which was in imminent\\r\\ndanger of being pulled down by an old woman\\'s rooting at its foundation,\\r\\nin hopes of finding treasure.]\\r\\n\\r\\nYear after year St. Patrick\\'s day came about, without her ever finding a\\r\\nfarthing by all her groping; and as she was always idle, she grew poorer\\r\\nand poorer.  Besides, to comfort herself for her disappointments, and to\\r\\ngive her spirits for fresh searches, she took to drinking.  She sold all\\r\\nshe had by degrees; but still she fancied that the lucky day would come\\r\\nsooner or later, THAT WOULD PAY FOR ALL.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoody Grope, however, reached her sixtieth year, without ever seeing this\\r\\nlucky day; and now, in her old age, she was a beggar, without a house to\\r\\nshelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put into her mouth, but what she\\r\\nbegged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to\\r\\nindustry and less to LUCK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Mary, honey! give me a potato and a sup of something, for the love\\r\\no\\' mercy; for not a bit have I had all day, except half a glass of whisky\\r\\nand a halfpenny worth of tobacco!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary immediately set before her some milk, and picked a good potato out\\r\\nof the bowl for her.  She was sorry to see such an old woman in such a\\r\\nwretched condition.  Goody Grope said she would rather have spirits of\\r\\nsome kind or other than milk; but Mary had no spirits to give her; so she\\r\\nsat herself down close to the fire, and after she had sighed and groaned\\r\\nand smoked for some time, she said to Mary, \"Well, and what have you done\\r\\nwith the treasure you had the luck to find?\"  Mary told her that she had\\r\\ncarried it to Mr. Hopkins, the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not what I would have done in your place,\" replied the old woman.\\r\\n\"When good luck came to you, what a shame to turn your back upon it!  But\\r\\nit is idle talking of what\\'s done--that\\'s past; but I\\'ll try my luck in\\r\\nthis here castle before next St. Patrick\\'s day comes about.  I was told\\r\\nit was more than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long\\r\\nago; but better late than never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was much alarmed, and not without reason, at this speech; for she\\r\\nknew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old\\r\\ncastle of Rossmore, she would soon bring it all down.  It was in vain to\\r\\ntalk to Goody Grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins, or\\r\\nof the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins.  She\\r\\nset her elbow upon her knees, and stopping her ears with her hands bid\\r\\nMary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders; for\\r\\nthat, let them say what they would, she would fall to work the next\\r\\nmorning, \"BARRING you\\'ll make it worth my while to let it alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what will make it worth your while to let it alone?\" said Mary; for\\r\\nshe saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her\\r\\nhabitation, or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf a crown, Goody Grope said, was the least she could be content to\\r\\ntake.  Mary paid the half-crown, and was in hopes that she had got rid\\r\\nfor ever of her tormentor, but she was mistaken, for scarcely was the\\r\\nweek at an end before the old woman appeared before her again, and\\r\\nrepeated her threats of falling to work the next morning, unless she had\\r\\nsomething given to her to buy tobacco.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day and the next, and the next, Goody Grope came on the same\\r\\nerrand, and poor Mary, who could ill-afford to supply her constantly with\\r\\nhalfpence, at last exclaimed, \"I am sure the finding of this treasure has\\r\\nnot been any good luck to us, but quite the contrary; and I wish we never\\r\\nhad found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this\\r\\nunfortunate pot of gold coins.  Mr. Hopkins, the agent, imagined that no\\r\\none knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor\\r\\nchildren; so, not being as honest as they were, he resolved to keep it\\r\\nfor his own use.  He was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a\\r\\nletter from his employer, Mr. Harvey, demanding from him the coins which\\r\\nhad been discovered at Rossmore Castle.  Hopkins had sold the gold coins,\\r\\nand some of the others; and he flattered himself that the children, and\\r\\nthe young ladies, to whom he now found they had been shown, could not\\r\\ntell whether what they had seen were gold or not, and he was not in the\\r\\nleast apprehensive that those of Henry the Seventh\\'s reign should be\\r\\nreclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention.  So he sent\\r\\nover the silver coins and others of little value, and apologized for his\\r\\nnot having mentioned them before, by saying that he considered them as\\r\\nmere rubbish.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harvey, in reply, observed that he could not consider as rubbish the\\r\\ngold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he\\r\\ninquired why these gold coins, and those of the reign of Henry the\\r\\nSeventh, were not now sent to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such; but he was\\r\\nthunderstruck when Mr. Harvey, in reply to this falsehood, sent him a\\r\\nlist of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him, and exact\\r\\ndrawings of those that were missing.  He informed him that this list and\\r\\nthese drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly\\r\\npersisting in falsehood.  He replied, that it was very likely such coins\\r\\nhad been found at Rossmore Castle, and that the ladies alluded to had\\r\\nprobably seen them; but he positively declared that they never came to\\r\\nhis hands; that he had restored all that were deposited with him; and\\r\\nthat, as to the others, he supposed they must have been taken out of the\\r\\npot by the children, or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the ladies\\'\\r\\nhouse to his.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard, from Isabella\\r\\nand Caroline, the charge that was made against them.  They looked at one\\r\\nanother in silence for some moments.  Then Peggy exclaimed--\"Sure!  Mr.\\r\\nHopkins has forgotten himself strangely.  Does not he remember Edmund\\'s\\r\\ncounting the things to him upon the great table in his hall, and we all\\r\\nstanding by!  I remember it as well as if it was this instant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I,\" cried Anne.  \"And don\\'t you recollect, Mary, your picking\\r\\nout the gold ones, and telling Mr. Hopkins that they were gold; and he\\r\\nsaid you knew nothing of the matter; and I was going to tell him that\\r\\nMiss Isabella had tried them, and knew that they were gold? but just then\\r\\nthere came in some tenants to pay their rent, and he pushed us out, and\\r\\ntwitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had taken up to show him\\r\\nthe bright spot which Miss Isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had\\r\\npoured on it?  I believe he was afraid I should steal it; he twitched it\\r\\nfrom my hand in such a hurry.  Do, Edmund; do, Mary--let us go to him,\\r\\nand put him in mind of all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go to him no more,\" said Edmund, sturdily.  \"He is a bad man--I\\'ll\\r\\nnever go to him again.  Mary, don\\'t be cast down--we have no need to be\\r\\ncast down--we are honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mary; \"but is not it a hard case that we, who have lived, as\\r\\nmy mother did all her life before us, in peace and honesty with all the\\r\\nworld, should now have our good name taken from us, when--\"  Mary\\'s voice\\r\\nfaltered and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be taken from us,\" cried Edmund, \"poor orphans though we are,\\r\\nand he a rich gentleman, as he calls himself.  Let him say and do what he\\r\\nwill, he can\\'t hurt our good name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was mistaken, alas! and Mary had but too much reason for her\\r\\nfears.  The affair was a great deal talked of; and the agent spared no\\r\\npains to have the story told his own way.  The orphans, conscious of\\r\\ntheir own innocence, took no pains about the matter; and the consequence\\r\\nwas, that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many,\\r\\nwho knew nothing of them, concluded that the agent must be in the right\\r\\nand the children in the wrong.  The buzz of scandal went on for some time\\r\\nwithout reaching their ears, because they lived very retiredly.  But one\\r\\nday, when Mary went to sell some stockings of Peggy\\'s knitting at the\\r\\nneighbouring fair, the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name\\r\\non the back of a note, and exclaimed, on seeing it--\"Ho! ho! mistress;\\r\\nI\\'d not have had any dealings with you, had I known your name sooner.\\r\\nWhere\\'s the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in vain that Mary related the fact.  She saw that she gained no\\r\\nbelief, as her character was not known to this man, or to any of those\\r\\nwho were present.  She left the fair as soon as she could; and though she\\r\\nstruggled against it, she felt very melancholy.  Still she exerted\\r\\nherself every day at her little manufacture; and she endeavoured to\\r\\nconsole herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not\\r\\ngive up her character, and who continued steadily to protect her and her\\r\\nsisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity\\r\\nof the orphans, but to prove it was in this instance out of their power.\\r\\nMr. Hopkins, the agent, and his friends, constantly repeated that the\\r\\ngold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his; and these\\r\\nladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those\\r\\nthat were, with great reason, suspected to be thieves.  The orphans were\\r\\nin a worse condition than ever when the winter came on, and their\\r\\nbenefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin.  The old\\r\\ncastle, it was true, was likely to last through the winter, as the mason\\r\\nsaid; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was, a little\\r\\nwhile ago, the uppermost thing in Mary\\'s thoughts, now it was not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night as Mary was going to bed, she heard someone knocking hard at\\r\\nthe door.  \"Mary, are you up? let us in,\" cried a voice, which she knew\\r\\nto be the voice of Betsy Green, the postmaster\\'s daughter, who lived in\\r\\nthe village near them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let Betsy in, and asked what she could want at such a time of night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me sixpence, and I\\'ll tell you,\" said Betsy; \"but waken Anne and\\r\\nPeggy.  Here\\'s a letter just come by post for you, and I stepped over to\\r\\nyou with it; because I guessed you\\'d be glad to have it, seeing it is\\r\\nyour brother\\'s handwriting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggy and Anne were soon roused, when they heard that there was a letter\\r\\nfrom Edmund.  It was by one of his rush candles that Mary read it; and\\r\\nthe letter was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MARY, NANCY, AND LITTLE PEG,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joy! joy!--I always said the truth would come out at last; and that he\\r\\ncould not take our good name from us.  But I will not tell you how it all\\r\\ncame about till we meet, which will be next week, as we are (I mean,\\r\\nmaster and mistress, and the young ladies--bless them!--and Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nand I) coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas; and a happy\\r\\nChristmas \\'tis likely to be for honest folks.  As for they that are not\\r\\nhonest, it is not for them to expect to be happy, at Christmas, or any\\r\\nother time.  You shall know all when we meet.  So, till then, fare ye\\r\\nwell, dear Mary, Nancy, and little Peg.\\r\\n                 \"Your joyful and affectionate brother,    EDMUND.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo comprehend why Edmund is joyful, our readers must be informed of\\r\\ncertain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin.\\r\\nOne morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent\\r\\nlibrary of a nobleman, who took generous and polite pleasure in thus\\r\\nsharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any\\r\\npretensions to science or literature.  Knowing that the gentleman who was\\r\\nnow come to see his library was skilled in antiquities, the nobleman\\r\\nopened a drawer of medals, to ask his opinion concerning the age of some\\r\\ncoins, which he had lately purchased at a high price.  They were the very\\r\\nsame which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle.  Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline knew them again instantly; and as the cross which Isabella had\\r\\nmade on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass, there\\r\\ncould be no possibility of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman, who was much interested both by the story of these orphans,\\r\\nand the manner in which it was told to him, sent immediately for the\\r\\nperson from whom he had purchased the coins.  He was a Jew broker.  At\\r\\nfirst he refused to tell them from whom he got them, because he had\\r\\nbought them, he said, under a promise of secrecy.  Being further pressed,\\r\\nhe acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he\\r\\nshould not sell them to anyone in Ireland, but that he had been tempted\\r\\nby the high price the present noble possessor had offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen, and that\\r\\nhe would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods, if he did\\r\\nnot confess the whole truth, he declared that he had purchased them from\\r\\na gentleman, whom he had never seen before or since; but he added, that\\r\\nhe could swear to his person, if he saw him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was at this time in Dublin, and Caroline\\'s\\r\\nfather posted the Jew, the next day, in the back-parlour of a banker\\'s\\r\\nhouse, with whom Mr. Hopkins had, on this day, appointed to settle some\\r\\naccounts.  Mr. Hopkins came--the Jew knew him--swore that he was the man\\r\\nwho had sold the coins to him; and thus the guilt of the agent and the\\r\\ninnocence of the orphans were completely proved.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr. Harvey,\\r\\ntheir landlord, and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him,\\r\\ncontaining a dismissal of the dishonest agent, and a reward for the\\r\\nhonest and industrious orphans.  Mr. Harvey desired that Mary and her\\r\\nsisters might have the slated house, rent free, from this time forward,\\r\\nunder the care of ladies Isabella and Caroline, as long as Mary or her\\r\\nsisters should carry on in it any useful business.  This was the joyful\\r\\nnews which Edmund had to tell his sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the neighbours shared in their joy, and the day of their removal from\\r\\nthe ruins of Rossmore Castle to their new house was the happiest of the\\r\\nChristmas holidays.  They were not envied for their prosperity; because\\r\\neverybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct; everybody\\r\\nexcept Goody Grope.  She exclaimed, as she wrung her hands with violent\\r\\nexpressions of sorrow--\"Bad luck to me! bad luck to me!--Why didn\\'t I go\\r\\nsooner to that there castle?  It is all luck, all luck in this world; but\\r\\nI never had no luck.  Think of the luck of these childer, that have found\\r\\na pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slated house, and\\r\\nall:  and here am I, with scarce a rag to cover me, and not a potato to\\r\\nput into my mouth!--I, that have been looking under ground all my days\\r\\nfor treasure, not to have a halfpenny at the last, to buy me tobacco!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny,\" said Betsy.\\r\\n\"Here Mary has been working hard, and so have her two little sisters and\\r\\nher brother, for these five years past; and they have made money for\\r\\nthemselves by their own industry--and friends too--not by luck, but by--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" interrupted Goody Grope; \"don\\'t be prating; don\\'t I know as\\r\\nwell as you do, that they found a pot of gold, BY GOOD LUCK? and is not\\r\\nthat the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied the postmaster\\'s daughter; \"this house is given to them AS\\r\\nA REWARD--that was the word in the letter; for I saw it.  Edmund showed\\r\\nit to me, and will show it to anyone that wants to see.  This house was\\r\\ngiven to them \\'AS A REWARD FOR THEIR HONESTY.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLAZY LAWRENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name\\r\\nof Preston.  She had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be\\r\\nseen in her garden.  It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for\\r\\nsupport; it consisted of strawberry beds, and one small border for\\r\\nflowers.  The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays, and sent\\r\\neither to Clifton or Bristol to be sold.  As to her strawberries, she did\\r\\nnot send them to market, because it was the custom for numbers of people\\r\\nto come from Clifton, in the summer time, to eat strawberries and cream\\r\\nat the gardens in Ashton.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the widow Preston was so obliging, active and good-humoured, that\\r\\neveryone who came to see her was pleased.  She lived happily in this\\r\\nmanner for several years; but, alas! one autumn she fell sick, and,\\r\\nduring her illness, everything went wrong; her garden was neglected, her\\r\\ncow died, and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for\\r\\nmedicines. The winter passed away, while she was so weak that she could\\r\\nearn but little by her work; and when the summer came, her rent was\\r\\ncalled for, and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual.  She\\r\\nbegged a few months\\' delay, and they were granted to her; but at the end\\r\\nof that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot.  Now\\r\\nLightfoot, though perhaps he had seen his best days, was a very great\\r\\nfavourite. In his youth he had always carried the dame to the market\\r\\nbehind her husband; and it was now her little son Jem\\'s turn to ride him.\\r\\nIt was Jem\\'s business to feed Lightfoot, and to take care of him--a\\r\\ncharge which he never neglected, for, besides being a very good natured,\\r\\nhe was a very industrious boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will go near to break my Jem\\'s heart,\" said Dame Preston to herself,\\r\\nas she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers, and\\r\\nconsidering how she had best open the matter to her son, who stood\\r\\nopposite to her, eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jem,\" said the old woman, \"what, ar\\'t hungry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I am, brave and hungry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay! no wonder, you\\'ve been brave hard at work--Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brave hard!  I wish it was not so dark, mother, that you might just step\\r\\nout and see the great bed I\\'ve dug; I know you\\'d say it was no bad day\\'s\\r\\nwork--and oh, mother! I\\'ve good news:  Farmer Truck will give us the\\r\\ngiant strawberries, and I\\'m to go for \\'em tomorrow morning, and I\\'ll be\\r\\nback afore breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless the boy! how he talks!--Four mile there, and four mile back\\r\\nagain, afore breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, upon Lightfoot, you know, mother, very easily; mayn\\'t I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, child!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you sigh, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Finish thy supper, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve done!\" cried Jem, swallowing the last mouthful hastily, as if he\\r\\nthought he had been too long at supper--\"and now for the great needle; I\\r\\nmust see and mend Lightfoot\\'s bridle afore I go to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo work he set, by the light of the fire, and the dame having once more\\r\\nstirred it, began again with \"Jem, dear, does he go lame at all now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Lightfoot!  Oh, la, no, not he--never was so well of his lameness\\r\\nin all his life.  He\\'s grown quite young again, I think, and then he\\'s so\\r\\nfat he can hardly wag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless him--that\\'s right.  We must see, Jem, and keep him fat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For what, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For Monday fortnight at the fair.  He\\'s to be--sold!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lightfoot!\" cried Jem, and let the bridle fall from his hand; \"and WILL\\r\\nmother sell Lightfoot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WILL? no:  but I MUST, Jem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MUST! who says you MUST? why MUST you, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must, I say, child.  Why, must not I pay my debts honestly; and must\\r\\nnot I pay my rent, and was not it called for long and long ago; and have\\r\\nnot I had time; and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday\\r\\nfortnight, and am not I two guineas short; and where am I to get two\\r\\nguineas?  So what signifies talking, child?\" said the widow, leaning her\\r\\nhead upon her arm.  \"Lightfoot MUST go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was silent for a few minutes--\"Two guineas, that\\'s a great, great\\r\\ndeal.  If I worked, and worked, and worked ever so hard, I could no ways\\r\\nearn two guineas AFORE Monday fortnight--could I, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord help thee, no; not an\\' work thyself to death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I could earn something, though, I say,\" cried Jem, proudly; \"and I\\r\\nWILL earn SOMETHING--if it be ever so little, it will be SOMETHING--and I\\r\\nshall do my very best; so I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I\\'m sure of, my child,\" said his mother, drawing him towards her\\r\\nand kissing him; \"you were always a good, industrious lad, THAT I will\\r\\nsay afore your face or behind your back;--but it won\\'t do now--Lightfoot\\r\\nMUST go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem turned away struggling to hide his tears, and went to bed without\\r\\nsaying a word more.  But he knew that crying would do no good; so he\\r\\npresently wiped his eyes, and lay awake, considering what he could\\r\\npossibly do to save the horse.  \"If I get ever so little,\" he still said\\r\\nto himself, \"it will be SOMETHING; and who knows but landlord might then\\r\\nwait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penny a day\\r\\nmight come to two guineas in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how to get the first penny was the question.  Then he recollected\\r\\nthat one day, when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers, he\\r\\nhad seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various\\r\\nsparkling stones, which people stopped to look at as they passed, and he\\r\\nremembered that some people bought the stones; one paid twopence, another\\r\\nthreepence, and another sixpence for them; and Jem heard her say that she\\r\\ngot them amongst the neighbouring rocks:  so he thought that if he tried\\r\\nhe might find some too, and sell them as she had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning he wakened full of this scheme, jumped up, dressed\\r\\nhimself, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable, set\\r\\noff to Clifton in search of the old woman, to inquire where she found her\\r\\nsparkling stones.  But it was too early in the morning, the old woman was\\r\\nnot at her seat; so he turned back again, disappointed.  He did not waste\\r\\nhis time waiting for her, but saddled and bridled Lightfoot, and went to\\r\\nFarmer Truck\\'s for the giant strawberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground;\\r\\nand, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in quest of the old\\r\\nwoman, whom, to his great joy, he spied sitting at her corner of the\\r\\nstreet with her board before her.  But this old woman was deaf and cross;\\r\\nand when at last Jem made her hear his questions, he could get no answer\\r\\nfrom her, but that she found the fossils where he would never find any\\r\\nmore.  \"But can\\'t I look where you looked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look away, nobody hinders you,\" replied the old woman; and these were\\r\\nthe only words she would say.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was not, however, a boy to be easily discouraged; he went to the\\r\\nrocks, and walked slowly along, looking at all the stones as he passed.\\r\\nPresently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening\\r\\nsome large rocks, and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking\\r\\nfor something very eagerly; Jem ran up, and asked if he could help him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the man, \"you can; I\\'ve just dropped, amongst this heap of\\r\\nrubbish, a fine piece of crystal that I got to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What kind of a looking thing is it?\" said Jem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"White, and like glass,\" said the man, and went on working whilst Jem\\r\\nlooked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said the man, \"it\\'s gone for ever; don\\'t trouble yourself any\\r\\nmore, my boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s no trouble; I\\'ll look a little longer; we\\'ll not give it up so\\r\\nsoon,\" said Jem; and after he had looked a little longer, he found the\\r\\npiece of crystal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank\\'e,\" said the man, \"you are a fine little industrious fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this,\\r\\nventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One good turn deserves another,\" said the man; \"we are going to dinner\\r\\njust now, and shall leave off work--wait for me here, and I\\'ll make it\\r\\nworth your while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem waited; and, as he was very attentively observing how the workmen\\r\\nwent on with their work, he heard somebody near him give a great yawn,\\r\\nand, turning round, he saw stretched upon the grass, beside the river, a\\r\\nboy about his own age, who, in the village of Ashton, as he knew, went by\\r\\nthe name of Lazy Lawrence--a name which he most justly deserved, for he\\r\\nnever did anything from morning to night.  He neither worked nor played,\\r\\nbut sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning.  His father was an\\r\\nale-house keeper, and being generally drunk, could take no care of his\\r\\nson; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse.  However, some\\r\\nof the neighbours said that he was a good natured, poor fellow enough,\\r\\nand would never do anyone harm but himself; whilst others, who were\\r\\nwiser, often shook their heads, and told him that idleness was the root\\r\\nof all evil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Lawrence!\" cried Jem to him, when he saw him lying upon the grass;\\r\\n\"what, are you asleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you awake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What makes you lie there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know--because I can\\'t find anybody to play with me to-day.  Will\\r\\nyou come and play?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I can\\'t; I\\'m busy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Busy,\" cried Lawrence, stretching himself, \"you are always busy.  I\\r\\nwould not be you for the world, to have so much to do always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" said Jem, laughing, \"would not be you for the world, to have\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then parted, for the workman just then called Jem to follow him.  He\\r\\ntook him home to his own house, and showed him a parcel of fossils, which\\r\\nhe had gathered, he said, on purpose to sell, but had never had time\\r\\nenough to sell them.  Now, however, he set about the task; and having\\r\\npicked out those which he judged to be the best, he put them in a small\\r\\nbasket, and gave them to Jem to sell, upon condition that he should bring\\r\\nhim half of what he got.  Jem, pleased to be employed, was ready to agree\\r\\nto what the man proposed, provided his mother had no objection.  When he\\r\\nwent home to dinner, he told his mother his scheme, and she smiled, and\\r\\nsaid he might do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his being from\\r\\nhome.  \"You are not an idle boy,\" said she; \"so there is little danger of\\r\\nyour getting into any mischief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly Jem that evening took his stand, with his little basket, upon\\r\\nthe bank of the river, just at the place where people land from a ferry-\\r\\nboat, and the walk turns to the wells, and numbers of people perpetually\\r\\npass to drink the waters.  He chose his place well, and waited nearly all\\r\\nthe evening, offering his fossils with great assiduity to every\\r\\npassenger; but not one person bought any.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo!\" cried some sailors, who had just rowed a boat to land, \"bear a\\r\\nhand here, will you, my little fellow, and carry these parcels for us\\r\\ninto yonder house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was asked to do\\r\\nso quickly, and with so much good-will, that the master of the boat took\\r\\nnotice of him, and, when he was going away, stopped to ask him what he\\r\\nhad got in his little basket; and when he saw that they were fossils, he\\r\\nimmediately told Jem to follow him, for that he was going to carry some\\r\\nshells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was\\r\\nmaking a grotto.  \"She will very likely buy your stones into the bargain.\\r\\nCome along, my lad; we can but try.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady lived but a very little way off, so that they were soon at her\\r\\nhouse.  She was alone in her parlour, and was sorting a bundle of\\r\\nfeathers of different colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a\\r\\nwindow seat, and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the\\r\\ntable to show off his shells, he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard,\\r\\nand scattered all the feathers.  The lady looked very sorry, which Jem\\r\\nobserving, he took the opportunity, whilst she was busy looking over the\\r\\nsailor\\'s bag of shells, to gather together all the feathers, and sort\\r\\nthem according to their different colours, as he had seen them sorted\\r\\nwhen he first came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is the little boy you brought with you?  I thought I saw him here\\r\\njust now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here I am, ma\\'am,\" cried Jem, creeping from under the table, with\\r\\nsome few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet; \"I\\r\\nthought,\" added he, pointing to the others, \"I had better be doing\\r\\nsomething than standing idle, ma\\'am.\"  She smiled, and, pleased with his\\r\\nactivity and simplicity, began to ask him several questions; such as who\\r\\nhe was, where he lived, what employment he had, and how much a day he\\r\\nearned by gathering fossils.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the first day I ever tried,\" said Jem; \"I never sold any yet,\\r\\nand if you don\\'t buy \\'em now, ma\\'am, I\\'m afraid nobody else will; for\\r\\nI\\'ve asked everybody else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then,\" said the lady, laughing, \"if that is the case, I think I\\r\\nhad better buy them all.\"  So, emptying all the fossils out of his\\r\\nbasket, she put half a crown into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem\\'s eyes sparkled with joy.  \"Oh, thank you, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"I will\\r\\nbe sure and bring you as many more, to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I don\\'t promise you,\" said she, \"to give you half a crown, to-\\r\\nmorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, perhaps, though you don\\'t promise it, you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the lady, \"do not deceive yourself; I assure you that I will\\r\\nnot.  THAT, instead of encouraging you to be industrious, would teach you\\r\\nto be idle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem did not quite understand what she meant by this, but answered, \"I\\'m\\r\\nsure I don\\'t wish to be idle; what I want is to earn something every day,\\r\\nif I know how; I\\'m sure I don\\'t wish to be idle.  If you knew all, you\\'d\\r\\nknow I did not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you mean, IF I KNEW ALL?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I mean, if you knew about Lightfoot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Lightfoot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, mammy\\'s horse,\" added Jem, looking out of the window; \"I must make\\r\\nhaste home, and feed him afore it gets dark; he\\'ll wonder what\\'s gone\\r\\nwith me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him wonder a few minutes longer,\" said the lady, \"and tell me the\\r\\nrest of your story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve no story, ma\\'am, to tell, but as how mammy says he must go to the\\r\\nfair Monday fortnight, to be sold, if she can\\'t get the two guineas for\\r\\nher rent; and I should be main sorry to part with him, for I love him,\\r\\nand he loves me; so I\\'ll work for him, I will, all I can.  To be sure, as\\r\\nmammy says, I have no chance, such a little fellow as I am, of earning\\r\\ntwo guineas afore Monday fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But are you willing earnestly to work?\" said the lady; \"you know there\\r\\nis a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones, and\\r\\nworking steadily every day, and all day long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Jem, \"I would work every day, and all day long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said the lady, \"I will give you work.  Come here, to-morrow\\r\\nmorning, and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies, and I will\\r\\npay you sixpence a day.  Remember, you must be at the gates by six\\r\\no\\'clock.\"  Jem bowed, thanked her, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the evening, and Jem was impatient to get home to feed\\r\\nLightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had\\r\\ntrusted him to sell the fossils, that he would bring him half of what he\\r\\ngot for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and\\r\\naway he went, running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile,\\r\\ntill he came to the man\\'s house.  He was just come home from work, and\\r\\nwas surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, \"Look what I\\r\\ngot for the stones; you are to have half, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the man, when he had heard his story, \"I shall not take half\\r\\nof that; it was given to you.  I expected but a shilling at the most, and\\r\\nthe half of that is but sixpence, and that I\\'ll take.  Wife, give the lad\\r\\ntwo shillings, and take this half-crown.\"  So the wife opened an old\\r\\nglove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as she opened the glove,\\r\\nput in his fingers, and took out a little silver penny.  \"There, he shall\\r\\nhave that into the bargain for his honesty--honesty is the best policy--\\r\\nthere\\'s a lucky penny for you, that I\\'ve kept ever since I can remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!\" cried the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him do what he will with it, wife,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" argued the wife, \"another penny would do just as well to buy\\r\\ngingerbread; and that\\'s what it will go for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that it shall not, I promise you,\" said Jem; and so he ran away\\r\\nhome, fed Lightfoot, stroked him, went to bed, jumped up at five o\\'clock\\r\\nin the morning, and went singing to work as gay as a lark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days he worked \"every day and all day long\"; and every evening the\\r\\nlady, when she came out to walk in her gardens, looked at his work.  At\\r\\nlast she said to her gardener, \"This little boy works very hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never had so good a little boy about the grounds,\" said the gardener;\\r\\n\"he\\'s always at his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got\\r\\ntwice as much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma\\'am; for\\r\\nlook here--he began at this \\'ere rose-bush, and now he\\'s got to where you\\r\\nstand, ma\\'am; and here is the day\\'s work that t\\'other boy, and he\\'s three\\r\\nyears older too, did to-day--I say, measure Jem\\'s fairly, and it\\'s twice\\r\\nas much, I\\'m sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the lady to her gardener, \"show me how much is a fair day\\'s\\r\\nwork for a boy of his age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come at six o\\'clock and go at six? why, about this much, ma\\'am,\" said\\r\\nthe gardener, marking off a piece of the border with his spade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, little boy,\" said the lady, \"so much shall be your task every day.\\r\\nThe gardener will mark it off for you; and when you\\'ve done, the rest of\\r\\nthe day you may do what you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had finished his task\\r\\nby four o\\'clock; so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself.\\r\\nHe was as fond of play as any little boy could be; and when he was at it\\r\\nhe played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable; so as soon as he\\r\\nhad finished his task, fed Lightfoot, and put by the sixpence he had\\r\\nearned that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where he found\\r\\na party of boys playing, and amongst them Lazy Lawrence, who indeed was\\r\\nnot playing, but lounging upon a gate, with his thumb in his mouth.  The\\r\\nrest were playing at cricket.  Jem joined them, and was the merriest and\\r\\nmost active amongst them; till, at last, when quite out of breath with\\r\\nrunning, he was obliged to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the\\r\\nstile, close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why don\\'t you play, Lawrence?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m tired,\" said Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tired of what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know well what tires me; grandmother says I\\'m ill, and I must\\r\\ntake something--I don\\'t know what ails me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pugh! take a good race--one, two, three, and away--and you\\'ll find\\r\\nyourself as well as ever.  Come, run--one, two, three, and away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, no, I can\\'t run, indeed,\" said he, hanging back heavily; \"you know I\\r\\ncan play all day long if I like it, so I don\\'t mind play as you do, who\\r\\nhave only one hour for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse for you.  Come, now, I\\'m quite fresh again, will you\\r\\nhave one game at ball? do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I tell you I can\\'t; I\\'m as tired as if I had been working all day\\r\\nlong as hard as a horse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten times more,\" said Jem, \"for I have been working all day long, as\\r\\nhard as a horse, and yet you see I\\'m not a bit tired, only a little out\\r\\nof breath just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s very odd,\" said Lawrence, and yawned, for want of some better\\r\\nanswer; then taking out a handful of halfpence,--\"See what I got from\\r\\nfather today, because I asked him just at the right time, when he had\\r\\ndrunk a glass or two; then I can get anything I want out of him--see! a\\r\\npenny, twopence, threepence, fourpence--there\\'s eightpence in all; would\\r\\nnot you be happy if you had EIGHTPENCE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I don\\'t know,\" said Jem, laughing, \"for you don\\'t seem happy, and\\r\\nyou HAVE EIGHTPENCE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That does not signify, though.  I\\'m sure you only say that because you\\r\\nenvy me.  You don\\'t know what it is to have eightpence.  You never had\\r\\nmore than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem smiled.  \"Oh, as to that,\" said he, \"you are mistaken, for I have at\\r\\nthis very time more than twopence, threepence, or eightpence either.  I\\r\\nhave--let me--see--stones, two shillings; then five days\\' work--that\\'s\\r\\nfive sixpences, that\\'s two shillings and sixpence; in all, makes four\\r\\nshillings and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and sevenpence--four\\r\\nand sevenpence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have not!\" said Lawrence, roused so as absolutely to stand upright,\\r\\n\"four and sevenpence, have you?  Show it me, and then I\\'ll believe you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Follow me, then,\" cried Jem, \"and I\\'ll soon make you believe me; come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it far?\" said Lawrence, following half-running, half-hobbling, till\\r\\nhe came to the stable, where Jem showed him his treasure.  \"And how did\\r\\nyou come by it--honestly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honestly! to be sure I did; I earned it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless me, earned it! well, I\\'ve a great mind to work; but then it\\'s\\r\\nsuch hot weather, besides, grandmother says I\\'m not strong enough yet for\\r\\nhard work; and besides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want\\r\\nit, so I need not work.  But four and sevenpence; let\\'s see, what will\\r\\nyou do with it all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a secret,\" said Jem, looking great.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess; I know what I\\'d do with it if it was mine.  First, I\\'d buy\\r\\npocketfuls of gingerbread; then I\\'d buy ever so many apples and nuts.\\r\\nDon\\'t you love nuts?  I\\'d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to\\r\\nChristmas, and I\\'d make little Newton crack \\'em for me, for that\\'s the\\r\\nworst of nuts; there\\'s the trouble of cracking \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you never deserve to have a nut.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ll give me some of yours,\" said Lawrence, in a fawning tone; for\\r\\nhe thought it easier to coax than to work--\"you\\'ll give me some of your\\r\\ngood things, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not have any of those good things,\" said Jem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, what will you do with all your money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told you, that\\'s a\\r\\nsecret, and I sha\\'n\\'t tell it anybody.  Come now, let\\'s go back and play-\\r\\n-their game\\'s up, I daresay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of humour with\\r\\nhimself and his eightpence.  \"If I had four and sevenpence,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"I certainly should be happy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, as usual, Jem jumped up before six o\\'clock and went to his\\r\\nwork, whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do\\r\\nwith himself.  In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his\\r\\nmoney in apples and gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found\\r\\nhimself well received by his companions; but, at length the third day he\\r\\nspent his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortunately some nuts\\r\\ntempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran\\r\\nhome to coax his father, as he called it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got home he heard his father talking very loud, and at first he\\r\\nthought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen door, he saw that he\\r\\nwas not drunk, but angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You lazy dog!\" cried he, turning suddenly upon Lawrence, and gave him\\r\\nsuch a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes; \"you\\r\\nlazy dog!  See what you\\'ve done for me--look!--look, look, I say!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses, and with\\r\\nfear, amazement and remorse, beheld at least a dozen bottles burst, and\\r\\nthe fine Worcestershire cider streaming over the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the\\r\\ncellar, and did not I charge you to wire the corks? answer me, you lazy\\r\\nrascal; did not I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Lawrence, scratching his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why was not it done, I ask you?\" cried his father, with renewed\\r\\nanger, as another bottle burst at the moment.  \"What do you stand there\\r\\nfor, you lazy brat? why don\\'t you move, I say?  No, no,\" catching hold of\\r\\nhim, \"I believe you can\\'t move; but I\\'ll make you.\"  And he shook him\\r\\ntill Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand.  \"What had you to think\\r\\nof?  What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider,\\r\\nmy Worcestershire cider, to the cellar when I bid you?  But go, you\\'ll\\r\\nnever be good for anything; you are such a lazy rascal--get out of my\\r\\nsight!\"  So saying, he pushed him out of the house door, and Lawrence\\r\\nsneaked off, seeing that this was no time to make his petition for\\r\\nhalfpence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he saw the nuts again, and wishing for them more than ever,\\r\\nhe went home, in hopes that his father, as he said to himself, would be\\r\\nin a better humour.  But the cider was still fresh in his recollection;\\r\\nand the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word \"halfpenny\" in his ear,\\r\\nhis father swore, with a loud oath, \"I will not give you a halfpenny, no,\\r\\nnot a farthing, for a month to come.  If you want money, go work for it;\\r\\nI\\'ve had enough of your laziness--go work!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears, and, going to the side\\r\\nof a ditch, sat down and cried for an hour; and when he had cried till he\\r\\ncould cry no more, he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets, to\\r\\nsee whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left; and, to his\\r\\ngreat joy, in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found.\\r\\nWith this he proceeded to the fruit woman\\'s stall.  She was busy weighing\\r\\nout some plums, so he was obliged to wait; and whilst he was waiting he\\r\\nheard some people near him talking and laughing very loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fruit woman\\'s stall was at the gate of an inn yard; and peeping\\r\\nthrough the gate in this yard, Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy,\\r\\nabout his own size, playing at pitch farthing.  He stood by watching them\\r\\nfor a few minutes.  \"I began but with one halfpenny,\" cried the stable\\r\\nboy, with an oath, \"and now I\\'ve got twopence!\" added he, jingling the\\r\\nhalfpence in his waistcoat pocket.  Lawrence was moved at the sound, and\\r\\nsaid to himself, \"If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end, like him,\\r\\nwith having twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to\\r\\nwork.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he stepped forward, presenting his halfpenny, offering to toss up with\\r\\nthe stable boy, who, after looking him full in the face, accepted the\\r\\nproposal, and threw his halfpenny into the air.  \"Head or tail?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Head,\" replied Lawrence, and it came up head.  He seized the penny,\\r\\nsurprised at his own success, and would have gone instantly to have laid\\r\\nit out in nuts; but the stable boy stopped him, and tempted him to throw\\r\\nagain.  This time Lawrence lost; he threw again and won; and so he went\\r\\non, sometimes losing, but most frequently winning, till half the morning\\r\\nwas lost.  At last, however, finding himself the master of three\\r\\nhalfpence, said he would play no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stable boy, grumbling, swore he would have his revenge another time,\\r\\nand Lawrence went and bought his nuts.  \"It is a good thing,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"to play at pitch farthing; the next time I want a halfpenny\\r\\nI\\'ll not ask my father for it, nor go to work neither.\"  Satisfied with\\r\\nthis resolution, he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure, upon the\\r\\nhorse block in the inn yard.  Here, whilst he ate, he overheard the\\r\\nconversation of the stable boys and postilions.  At first their shocking\\r\\noaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him; for Lawrence, though\\r\\nlazy, had not yet learned to be a wicked boy.  But, by degrees, he was\\r\\naccustomed to the swearing and quarrelling, and took a delight and\\r\\ninterest in their disputes and battles.  As this was an amusement which\\r\\nhe could enjoy without any sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it,\\r\\nthat every day he returned to the stable yard, and the horse block became\\r\\nhis constant seat.  Here he found some relief from the insupportable\\r\\nfatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after hour, with his elbows on\\r\\nhis knees, and his head on his hands, he sat, the spectator of\\r\\nwickedness.  Gaming, cheating and lying soon became familiar to him; and,\\r\\nto complete his ruin, he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the\\r\\nstable boy (a very bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see.  But it is now\\r\\ntime to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after Jem had finished his task, the gardener asked him to stay\\r\\na little while, to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall.\\r\\nJem, always active and obliging, readily stayed from play, and was\\r\\ncarrying in a heavy flower pot, when his mistress crossed the hall.\\r\\n\"What a terrible litter!\" said she, \"you are making here--why don\\'t you\\r\\nwipe your shoes upon the mat?\"  Jem turned to look for the mat, but he\\r\\nsaw none.  \"Oh,\" said the lady recollecting herself, \"I can\\'t blame you,\\r\\nfor there is no mat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am,\" said the gardener, \"nor I don\\'t know when, if ever, the man\\r\\nwill bring home those mats you bespoke, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry to hear that,\" said the lady; \"I wish we could find\\r\\nsomebody who would do them, if he can\\'t.  I should not care what sort of\\r\\nmats they were, so that one could wipe one\\'s feet on them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem, as he was sweeping away the litter, when he heard these last words,\\r\\nsaid to himself, \"Perhaps I could make a mat.\"  And all the way home, as\\r\\nhe trudged along whistling, he was thinking over a scheme for making\\r\\nmats, which, however bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing,\\r\\nwith patience and industry.  Many were the difficulties which his\\r\\n\"prophetic eye\" foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which\\r\\nspurs men on to great enterprises, and makes them \"trample on\\r\\nimpossibilities.\"  In the first place, he recollected that he had seen\\r\\nLazy Lawrence, whilst he lounged upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into\\r\\ndifferent shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of\\r\\nplaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green soft\\r\\nmat, which would do very well for one to wipe one\\'s shoes on.  About a\\r\\nmile from his mother\\'s house, on the common which Jem rode over when he\\r\\nwent to Farmer Truck\\'s for the giant strawberries, he remembered to have\\r\\nseen a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only six o\\'clock\\r\\nin the evening, he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot,\\r\\nstroke him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his skill\\r\\nbefore he went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLightfoot carried him swiftly to the common, and there Jem gathered as\\r\\nmuch of the heath as he thought he should want.  But what toil! what\\r\\ntime! what pains did it cost him, before he could make anything like a\\r\\nmat!  Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath, and give up his\\r\\nproject, from impatience of repeated disappointments.  But still he\\r\\npersevered.  Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and\\r\\ntime.  Two hours he worked before he went to bed.  All his play hours the\\r\\nnext day he spent at his mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitless\\r\\nattempts.  The sixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other\\r\\nfive.  He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath\\r\\nsubstantially together, and at length completely finished a mat, which\\r\\nfar surpassed his most sanguine expectations.  He was extremely happy--\\r\\nsang, danced round it--whistled--looked at it again and again, and could\\r\\nhardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed.  He laid it\\r\\nby his bedside, that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress.  She\\r\\nlooked fully as much surprised as he expected, when she saw it, and when\\r\\nshe heard who made it.  After having duly admired it, she asked how much\\r\\nhe expected for his mat.  \"Expect!--Nothing, ma\\'am,\" said Jem; \"I meant\\r\\nto give it you, if you\\'d have it; I did not mean to sell it.  I made it\\r\\nin my play hours, I was very happy in making it; and I\\'m very glad, too,\\r\\nthat you like it; and if you please to keep it, ma\\'am, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s not all,\" said the lady.  \"Spend your time no more in weeding\\r\\nin my garden, you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the\\r\\nreward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry.  Make as many more\\r\\nsuch mats as you can, and I will take care and dispose of them for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank\\'e, ma\\'am,\" said Jem, making his best bow, for he thought by the\\r\\nlady\\'s looks that she meant to do him a favour, though he repeated to\\r\\nhimself, \"Dispose of them, what does that mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon learned to\\r\\nmake them so well and quickly, that he was surprised at his own success.\\r\\nIn every one he made he found less difficulty, so that, instead of making\\r\\ntwo, he could soon make four in a day.  In a fortnight he made eighteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at three\\r\\njourneys, his eighteen mats to his mistress\\' house; piled them all up in\\r\\nthe hall, and stood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility,\\r\\nbeside the pile, waiting for his mistress\\' appearance.  Presently a\\r\\nfolding-door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress,\\r\\nwith a great many gentlemen and ladies, rising from several tables.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! there is my little boy and his mats,\" cried the lady; and, followed\\r\\nby all the rest of the company, she came into the hall.  Jem modestly\\r\\nretired whilst they looked at his mats; but in a minute or two his\\r\\nmistress beckoned to him, and when he came into the middle of the circle,\\r\\nhe saw that his pile of mats had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the lady, smiling, \"what do you see that makes you look so\\r\\nsurprised?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That all my mats are gone,\" said Jem; \"but you are very welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we?\" said the lady, \"well, take up your hat and go home then, for\\r\\nyou see that it is getting late, and you know Lightfoot will wonder\\r\\nwhat\\'s become of you.\"  Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he had\\r\\nleft on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with shillings.\\r\\nEveryone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the\\r\\neighteen mats he had got thirty-six shillings.  \"Thirty-six shillings,\"\\r\\nsaid the lady; \"five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned\\r\\nalready--how much does that make?  I must add, I believe, one other\\r\\nsixpence to make out your two guineas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two guineas!\" exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering his bashfulness, for\\r\\nat the moment he forgot where he was, and saw nobody that was by.  \"Two\\r\\nguineas!\" cried he, clapping his hands together,--\"O, Lightfoot!  O,\\r\\nmother!\"  Then, recollecting himself, he saw his mistress, whom he now\\r\\nlooked up to quite as a friend.  \"Will YOU thank them all?\" said he,\\r\\nscarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company; \"will YOU\\r\\nthank \\'em, for you know I don\\'t know how to thank \\'em RIGHTLY.\"\\r\\nEverybody thought, however, that they had been thanked RIGHTLY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now we won\\'t keep you any longer, only,\" said his mistress, \"I have one\\r\\nthing to ask you, that I may be by when you show your treasure to your\\r\\nmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then,\" said Jem, \"come with me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not now,\" said the lady, laughing; \"but I will come to Ashton to-morrow\\r\\nevening; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she will,\" said Jem:  \"I\\'ll search the garden myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now went home, but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow\\r\\nevening before he told his mother.  To console himself he flew to the\\r\\nstable:--\"Lightfoot, you\\'re not to be sold on Monday, poor fellow!\" said\\r\\nhe, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money.\\r\\nWhilst he was intent upon this, Jem was startled by a noise at the door:\\r\\nsomebody was trying to pull up the latch.  It opened, and there came in\\r\\nLazy Lawrence, with a boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm.\\r\\nThey started when they got into the middle of the stable, and when they\\r\\nsaw Jem, who had been at first hidden by the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We--we--we came,\" stammered Lazy Lawrence--\"I mean, I came to--to--to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To ask you,\" continued the stable-boy, in a bold tone, \"whether you will\\r\\ngo with us to the cock-fight on Monday?  See, I\\'ve a fine cock here, and\\r\\nLawrence told me you were a great friend of his; so I came.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of\\r\\ncock-fighting and in recommendation of his new companion.  But Jem looked\\r\\nat the stable-boy with dislike, and a sort of dread.  Then turning his\\r\\neyes upon the cock with a look of compassion, said, in a low voice, to\\r\\nLawrence, \"Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Lawrence, \"as to that; but they say a cockfight\\'s a\\r\\nfine sight, and it\\'s no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great\\r\\nmany go, and I\\'ve nothing else to do, so I shall go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have something else to do,\" said Jem, laughing, \"so I shall not\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" continued Lawrence, \"you know Monday is the great Bristol fair,\\r\\nand one must be merry then, of all the days in the year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One day in the year, sure, there\\'s no harm in being merry,\" said the\\r\\nstable boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not,\" said Jem; \"for I know for my part, I am merry every day in\\r\\nthe year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s very odd,\" said Lawrence; \"but I know for my part, I would not\\r\\nfor all the world miss going to the fair, for at least it will be\\r\\nsomething to talk of for half a year after.  Come, you\\'ll go, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Jem, still looking as if he did not like to talk before the\\r\\nill-looking stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what will you do with all your money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you about that another time,\" whispered Jem; \"and don\\'t you go\\r\\nto see that cock\\'s eyes pecked out; it won\\'t make you merry, I\\'m sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had anything else to divert me,\" said Lawrence, hesitating and\\r\\nyawning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" cried the stable boy, seizing his stretching arm, \"come along,\"\\r\\ncried he; and, pulling him away from Jem, upon whom he cast a look of\\r\\nextreme contempt; \"leave him alone, he\\'s not the sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a fool you are,\" said he to Lawrence, the moment he got him out of\\r\\nthe stable; \"you might have known he would not go, else we should soon\\r\\nhave trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence.  But how came you to\\r\\ntalk of four and sevenpence.  I saw in the manger a hat full of silver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed; but why did you stammer so when we first got in?  You had\\r\\nliked to have blown us all up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was so ashamed,\" said Lawrence, hanging down his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ashamed! but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it, and I\\r\\nsha\\'n\\'t let you off; you owe us half a crown, recollect, and I must be\\r\\npaid to-night, so see and get the money somehow or other.\"  After a\\r\\nconsiderable pause he added, \"I answer for it he\\'d never miss half a\\r\\ncrown out of all that silver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But to steal,\" said Lawrence, drawing back with horror, \"I never thought\\r\\nI should come to that--and from poor Jem, too--the money that he has\\r\\nworked so hard for, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not stealing; we don\\'t mean to steal; only to borrow it; and\\r\\nif we win, which we certainly shall, at the cock-fight, pay it back\\r\\nagain, and he\\'ll never know anything about the matter, and what harm will\\r\\nit do him?  Besides, what signifies talking, you can\\'t go to the cock-\\r\\nfight, or the fair either, if you don\\'t; and I tell ye we don\\'t mean to\\r\\nsteal it; we\\'ll pay it by Monday night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to any\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere let us pause in our story.  We are almost afraid to go on.  The rest\\r\\nis very shocking.  Our little readers will shudder as they read.  But it\\r\\nis better that they should know the truth, and see what the idle boy came\\r\\nto at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dead of the night, Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window.  He\\r\\nknew well who it was, for this was the signal agreed upon between him and\\r\\nhis wicked companion.  He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about\\r\\nto do, and lay quite still, with his head under the bedclothes, till he\\r\\nheard the second tap.  Then he got up, dressed himself, and opened his\\r\\nwindow.  It was almost even with the ground.  His companion said to him,\\r\\nin a hollow voice, \"Are you ready?\"  He made no answer, but got out of\\r\\nthe window and followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon,\\r\\nand it was quite dark.  \"Where are you?\" whispered Lawrence, groping\\r\\nabout, \"where are you?  Speak to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here; give me your hand.\"  Lawrence stretched out his hand.  \"Is\\r\\nthat your hand?\" said the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; \"how\\r\\ncold it feels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go back,\" said Lawrence; \"it is time yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no time to go back,\" replied the other, opening the door; \"you\\'ve\\r\\ngone too far now to go back,\" and he pushed Lawrence into the stable.\\r\\n\"Have you found it?  Take care of the horse.  Have you done?  What are\\r\\nyou about?  Make haste, I hear a noise,\" said the stable boy, who watched\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am feeling for the half-crown, but I can\\'t find it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring all together.\"  He brought Jem\\'s broken flower pot, with all the\\r\\nmoney in it, to the door.  The black cloud had now passed over the moon,\\r\\nand the light shone full upon them.  \"What do we stand here for?\" said\\r\\nthe stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of Lawrence\\'s trembling\\r\\nhands, and pulled him away from the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" cried Lawrence, \"you won\\'t take all.  You said you\\'d only\\r\\ntake half a crown, and pay it back on Monday.  You said you\\'d only take\\r\\nhalf a crown!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the other, walking on, deaf to all\\r\\nremonstrances--\"if ever I am to be hanged, it sha\\'n\\'t be for half a\\r\\ncrown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence\\'s blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as if all his hair\\r\\nstood on end.  Not another word passed.  His accomplice carried off the\\r\\nmoney, and Lawrence crept, with all the horrors of guilt upon him, to his\\r\\nrestless bed.  All night he was starting from frightful dreams; or else,\\r\\nbroad awake, he lay listening to every small noise, unable to stir, and\\r\\nscarcely daring to breathe--tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds\\r\\nof fear, that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought the morning would never come; but when it was day, when he\\r\\nheard the birds sing, and saw everything look cheerful as usual, he felt\\r\\nstill more miserable.  It was Sunday morning, and the bell rang for\\r\\nchurch.  All the children of the village, dressed in their Sunday\\r\\nclothes, innocent and gay, and little Jem, the best and gayest amongst\\r\\nthem, went flocking by his door to church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lawrence,\" said Jem, pulling his coat as he passed and saw\\r\\nLawrence leaning against his father\\'s door, \"what makes you look so\\r\\nblack?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" said Lawrence, starting; \"why do you say that I look black?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, then,\" said Jem, \"you look white enough now, if that will please\\r\\nyou, for you\\'re turned as pale as death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pale?\" replied Lawrence, not knowing what he said, and turned abruptly\\r\\naway, for he dared not stand another look of Jem\\'s; conscious that guilt\\r\\nwas written in his face, he shunned every eye.  He would now have given\\r\\nthe world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind.\\r\\nHe longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees and confess all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss, Lawrence dared not\\r\\nstay at home, and not knowing what to do, or where to go, he mechanically\\r\\nwent to his old haunt at the stable yard, and lurked thereabouts all day\\r\\nwith his accomplice, who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his\\r\\nspirits by talking of the next day\\'s cock-fight.  It was agreed that as\\r\\nsoon as the dusk of the evening came on, they should go together into a\\r\\ncertain lonely field, and there divide their booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Jem, when he returned from church, was very full of\\r\\nbusiness, preparing for the reception of his mistress, of whose intended\\r\\nvisit he had informed his mother; and whilst she was arranging the\\r\\nkitchen and their little parlour, he ran to search the strawberry beds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!\" said his mother, when he came in\\r\\nwith the strawberries, and was jumping about the room playfully.  \"Now,\\r\\nkeep those spirits of yours, Jem, till you want \\'em, and don\\'t let it\\r\\ncome upon you all at once.  Have it in mind that to-morrow\\'s fair day,\\r\\nand Lightfoot must go.  I bid Farmer Truck call for him to-night.  He\\r\\nsaid he\\'d take him along with his own, and he\\'ll be here just now--and\\r\\nthen I know how it will be with you, Jem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I!\" cried Jem, swallowing his secret with great difficulty, and\\r\\nthen tumbling head over heels four times running.\\r\\n\\r\\nA carriage passed the window, and stopped at the door.  Jem ran out; it\\r\\nwas his mistress.  She came in smiling, and soon made the old woman\\r\\nsmile, too, by praising the neatness of everything in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall pass over, however important as they were deemed at the time,\\r\\nthe praises of the strawberries, and of \"my grandmother\\'s china plate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother knock was heard at the door.  \"Run, Jem,\" said his mother.  \"I\\r\\nhope it\\'s our milk-woman with cream for the lady.\"  No; it was Farmer\\r\\nTruck come for Lightfoot.  The old woman\\'s countenance fell.  \"Fetch him\\r\\nout, dear,\" said she, turning to her son; but Jem was gone; he flew out\\r\\nto the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck\\'s great-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit ye down, farmer,\" said the old woman, after they had waited about\\r\\nfive minutes in expectation of Jem\\'s return.  \"You\\'d best sit down, if\\r\\nthe lady will give you leave; for he\\'ll not hurry himself back again.  My\\r\\nboy\\'s a fool, madam, about that there horse.\"  Trying to laugh, she\\r\\nadded, \"I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part.  He\\r\\nwon\\'t bring him out till the last minute; so do sit ye down, neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem, with a pale, wild countenance\\r\\ncame back.  \"What\\'s the matter?\" said his mistress.  \"God bless the boy!\"\\r\\nsaid his mother, looking at him quite frightened, whilst he tried to\\r\\nspeak, but could not.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went up to him, and then leaning his head against her, he cried,\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone!--it\\'s all gone!\" and, bursting into tears, he sobbed as if\\r\\nhis little heart would break.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s gone, love?\" said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My two guineas--Lightfoot\\'s two guineas.  I went to fetch \\'em to give\\r\\nyou, mammy; but the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all\\'s\\r\\ngone!--quite gone!\" repeated he, checking his sobs.  \"I saw them safe\\r\\nlast night, and was showing \\'em to Lightfoot; and I was so glad to think\\r\\nI had earned them all myself; and I thought how surprised you\\'d look, and\\r\\nhow glad you\\'d be, and how you\\'d kiss me, and all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother listened to him with the greatest surprise, whilst his\\r\\nmistress stood in silence, looking first at the old woman, and then at\\r\\nJem with a penetrating eye, as if she suspected the truth of his story,\\r\\nand was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a very strange thing!\" said she, gravely.  \"How came you to\\r\\nleave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the stable?  How came you\\r\\nnot to give it to your mother to take care of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, don\\'t you remember?\" said Jem, looking up, in the midst of his\\r\\ntears--\"why, don\\'t you remember you, your own self, bid me not tell her\\r\\nabout it till you were by?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you not tell her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, ask mammy,\" said Jem, a little offended; and when afterwards the\\r\\nlady went on questioning him in a severe manner, as if she did not\\r\\nbelieve him, he at last made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jem! Jem! why don\\'t you speak to the lady?\" said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have spoke, and spoke the truth,\" said Jem, proudly; \"and she did not\\r\\nbelieve me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be without\\r\\nsuspicion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to wait the event\\r\\nwithout interfering, saying only, that she hoped the money would be\\r\\nfound, and advised Jem to have done crying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have done,\" said Jem; \"I shall cry no more.\"  And as he had the\\r\\ngreatest command over himself, he actually did not shed another tear, not\\r\\neven when the farmer got up to go, saying, he could wait no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem silently went to bring out Lightfoot.  The lady now took her seat,\\r\\nwhere she could see all that passed at the open parlour-window.  The old\\r\\nwoman stood at the door, and several idle people of the village, who had\\r\\ngathered round the lady\\'s carriage examining it, turned about to listen.\\r\\nIn a minute or two Jem appeared, with a steady countenance, leading\\r\\nLightfoot and, when he came up, without saying a word, put the bridle\\r\\ninto Farmer Truck\\'s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He HAS BEEN a good horse,\" said the farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He IS a good horse!\" cried Jem, and threw his arm over Lightfoot\\'s neck,\\r\\nhiding his own face as he leaned upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant a party of milk-women went by; and one of them, having\\r\\nset down her pail, came behind Jem, and gave him a pretty smart blow upon\\r\\nthe back.  He looked up.  \"And don\\'t you know me?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I forget,\" said Jem; \"I think I have seen your face before, but I\\r\\nforget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you so? and you\\'ll tell me just now,\" said she, half opening her\\r\\nhand, \"that you forget who gave you this, and who charged you not to part\\r\\nwith it, too.\"  Here she quite opened her large hand, and on the palm of\\r\\nit appeared Jem\\'s silver penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\" exclaimed Jem, seizing it, \"oh, where did you find it? and have\\r\\nyou--oh, tell me, have you got the rest of my money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing of your money--I don\\'t know what you would be at,\" said\\r\\nthe milk-woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But where--pray tell me where--did you find this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With them that you gave it to, I suppose,\" said the milk-woman, turning\\r\\naway suddenly to take up her milk-pail.  But now Jem\\'s mistress called to\\r\\nher through the window, begging her to stop, and joining in his\\r\\nentreaties to know how she came by the silver penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, madam,\" said she, taking up the corner of her apron, \"I came by it\\r\\nin an odd way, too.  You must know my Betty is sick, so I came with the\\r\\nmilk myself, though it\\'s not what I\\'m used to; for my Betty--you know my\\r\\nBetty?\" said she, turning round to the old woman, \"my Betty serves you,\\r\\nand she\\'s a tight and stirring lassy, ma\\'am, I can assure--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I don\\'t doubt it,\" said the lady, impatiently; \"but about the\\r\\nsilver penny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that\\'s true; as I was coming along all alone, for the rest came\\r\\nround, and I came a short cut across yon field--no, you can\\'t see it,\\r\\nmadam, where you stand--but if you were here--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see it--I know it,\" said Jem, out of breath with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--well--I rested my pail upon the stile, and sets me down awhile,\\r\\nand there comes out of the hedge--I don\\'t know well how, for they\\r\\nstartled me so I\\'d liked to have thrown down my milk--two boys, one about\\r\\nthe size of he,\" said she pointing to Jem, \"and one a matter taller, but\\r\\nill-looking like; so I did not think to stir to make way for them, and\\r\\nthey were like in a desperate hurry:  so, without waiting for the stile,\\r\\none of \\'em pulled at the gate, and when it would not open (for it was\\r\\ntied with a pretty stout cord) one of \\'em whips out with his knife and\\r\\ncuts it--  Now, have you a knife about you, sir?\" continued the milk\\r\\nwoman to the farmer.  He gave her his knife.  \"Here, now, ma\\'am, just\\r\\nsticking, as it were here, between the blade and the haft, was the silver\\r\\npenny.  The lad took no notice; but when he opened it, out it falls.\\r\\nStill he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I said before, and through\\r\\nthe gate they went, and out of sight in half a minute.  I picks up the\\r\\npenny, for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a\\r\\nlong time, and had given against my voice to he,\" pointing to Jem; \"and I\\r\\ncharged him not to part with it; and, ma\\'am, when I looked I knew it by\\r\\nthe mark, so I thought I would show it to HE,\" again pointing to Jem,\\r\\n\"and let him give it back to those it belongs to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It belongs to me,\" said Jem, \"I never gave it to anybody--but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" cried the farmer, \"those boys have robbed him; it is they who have\\r\\nall his money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, which way did they go?\" cried Jem, \"I\\'ll run after them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said the lady, calling to her servant; and she desired him to\\r\\ntake his horse and ride after them.  \"Ay,\" added Farmer Truck, \"do you\\r\\ntake the road, and I\\'ll take the field way, and I\\'ll be bound we\\'ll have\\r\\n\\'em presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves, the lady, who was now\\r\\nthoroughly convinced of Jem\\'s truth, desired her coachman would produce\\r\\nwhat she had ordered him to bring with him that evening.  Out of the boot\\r\\nof the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and\\r\\nbridle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Jem\\'s eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot\\'s back!\\r\\n\"Put it on your horse yourself, Jem,\" said the lady; \"it is yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConfused reports of Lightfoot\\'s splendid accoutrements, of the pursuit of\\r\\nthieves, and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame\\r\\nPreston\\'s window, quickly spread through the village, and drew everybody\\r\\nfrom their houses.  They crowded round Jem to hear the story.  The\\r\\nchildren especially, who were fond of him, expressed the strongest\\r\\nindignation against the thieves.  Every eye was on the stretch; and now\\r\\nsome, who had run down the lane, came back shouting, \"Here they are!\\r\\nthey\\'ve got the thieves!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe footman on horseback carried one boy before him; and the farmer,\\r\\nstriding along, dragged another.  The latter had on a red jacket, which\\r\\nlittle Jem immediately recollected, and scarcely dared lift his eyes to\\r\\nlook at the boy on horseback.  \"Good God!\" said he to himself, \"it must\\r\\nbe--yet surely it can\\'t be Lawrence!\"  The footman rode on as fast as the\\r\\npeople would let him.  The boy\\'s hat was slouched, and his head hung\\r\\ndown, so that nobody could see his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd.  A man who was half\\r\\ndrunk pushed his way forwards, swearing that nobody should stop him; that\\r\\nhe had a right to see--and he WOULD see.  And so he did; for, forcing\\r\\nthrough all resistance, he staggered up to the footman just as he was\\r\\nlifting down the boy he had carried before him.  \"I WILL--I tell you I\\r\\nWILL see the thief!\" cried the drunken man, pushing up the boy\\'s hat.  It\\r\\nwas his own son.  \"Lawrence!\" exclaimed the wretched father.  The shock\\r\\nsobered him at once, and he hid his face in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an awful silence.  Lawrence fell on his knees, and in a voice\\r\\nthat could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the\\r\\ncircumstances of his guilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such a young creature so wicked!\" the bystanders exclaimed; \"what could\\r\\nput such wickedness in your head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad company,\" said Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how came you--what brought you into bad company?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, except it was idleness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence\\'s pockets;\\r\\nand when the money appeared, all his former companions in the village\\r\\nlooked at each other with astonishment and terror.  Their parents grasped\\r\\ntheir little hands closer, and cried, \"Thank God! he is not my son.  How\\r\\noften when he was little we used, as he lounged about, to tell him that\\r\\nidleness was the root of all evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the hardened wretch, his accomplice, everyone was impatient to\\r\\nhave him sent to gaol.  He put on a bold, insolent countenance, till he\\r\\nheard Lawrence\\'s confession; till the money was found upon him; and he\\r\\nheard the milk-woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny\\r\\nwhich he had dropped.  Then he turned pale, and betrayed the strongest\\r\\nsigns of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must take him before the justice,\" said the farmer, \"and he\\'ll be\\r\\nlodged in Bristol gaol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Jem, springing forwards when Lawrence\\'s hands were going to be\\r\\ntied, \"let him go--won\\'t you?--can\\'t you let him go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam, for mercy\\'s sake,\" said Jem\\'s mother to the lady, \"think\\r\\nwhat a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair.  \"It\\'s all\\r\\nmy fault,\" cried he; \"I brought him up in idleness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'ll never be idle any more,\" said Jem; \"won\\'t you speak for him,\\r\\nma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t ask the lady to speak for him,\" said the farmer; \"it\\'s better he\\r\\nshould go to Bridewell now, than to the gallows by-and-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing more was said; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer\\'s\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month, and the stable-boy\\r\\nwas sent for trial, convicted, and transported to Botany Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Lawrence\\'s confinement, Jem often visited him, and carried him\\r\\nsuch little presents as he could afford to give; and Jem could afford to\\r\\nbe GENEROUS, because he was INDUSTRIOUS.  Lawrence\\'s heart was touched by\\r\\nhis kindness, and his example struck him so forcibly that, when his\\r\\nconfinement was ended, he resolved to set immediately to work; and, to\\r\\nthe astonishment of all who knew him, soon became remarkable for\\r\\nindustry.  He was found early and late at his work, established a new\\r\\ncharacter, and for ever lost the name of \"Lazy Lawrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FALSE KEY.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Spencer, a very benevolent and sensible man, undertook the education\\r\\nof several poor children.  Among the rest was a boy of the name of\\r\\nFranklin, whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old.\\r\\nFranklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character;\\r\\nand for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child.  When\\r\\nany of the neighbours\\' children quarrelled with him, they used to tell\\r\\nhim that he would turn out like his father.  But Mr. Spencer always\\r\\nassured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased; that by\\r\\nbehaving well he would certainly, sooner or later, secure the esteem and\\r\\nlove of all who knew him, even of those who had the strongest prejudice\\r\\nagainst him on his father\\'s account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hope was very delightful to Franklin, and he showed the strongest\\r\\ndesire to learn and to do everything that was right; so that Mr. Spencer\\r\\nsoon grew fond of him, and took great pains to instruct him, and to give\\r\\nhim all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful,\\r\\nrespectable and happy man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was about thirteen years of age, Mr. Spencer one day sent for him\\r\\ninto his closet; and as he was folding up a letter which he had been\\r\\nwriting, said to him, with a very kind look, but in a graver tone than\\r\\nusual, \"Franklin, you are going to leave me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir!\" said Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world for yourself.  You\\r\\nwill carry this letter to my sister, Mrs. Churchill, in Queen\\'s Square.\\r\\nYou know Queen\\'s Square?\"  Franklin bowed.  \"You must expect,\" continued\\r\\nMr. Spencer, \"to meet with several disagreeable things, and a great deal\\r\\nof rough work, at your first setting out; but be faithful and obedient to\\r\\nyour mistress, and obliging to your fellow-servants, and all will go\\r\\nwell.  Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mistress, if you behave\\r\\nproperly; and I have no doubt but you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will always--I mean, as long as you deserve it--find a friend in\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir--I am sure you are--\"  There Franklin stopped short, for\\r\\nthe recollection of all Mr. Spencer\\'s goodness rushed upon him at once,\\r\\nand he could not say another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring me a candle to seal this letter,\" said his master; and he was very\\r\\nglad to get out of the room.  He came back with the candle, and, with a\\r\\nstout heart, stood by whilst the letter was sealing; and, when his master\\r\\nput it into his hand, said, in a cheerful voice, \"I hope you will let me\\r\\nsee you again, sir, sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly; whenever your mistress can spare you, I shall be very glad to\\r\\nsee you; and remember, if ever you get into any difficulty, don\\'t be\\r\\nafraid to come to me.  I have sometimes spoken harshly to you; but you\\r\\nwill not meet with a more indulgent friend.\"  Franklin at this turned\\r\\naway with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to\\r\\nexpress his gratitude, left the room without being able to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got to Queen\\'s Square about three o\\'clock.  The door was opened by a\\r\\nlarge, red-faced man, in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat, to whom he\\r\\nfelt afraid to give his message, lest he should not be a servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s your business, sir?\" said the butler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, sir,\" said Franklin, endeavouring to\\r\\npronounce his \"sir\" in a tone as respectful as the butler\\'s was insolent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man having examined the direction, seal, and edges of the letter,\\r\\ncarried it upstairs, and in a few minutes returned, and ordered Franklin\\r\\nto rub his shoes well and follow him.  He was then shown into a handsome\\r\\nroom, where he found his mistress--an elderly lady.  She asked him a few\\r\\nquestions, examining him attentively as she spoke; and her severe eye at\\r\\nfirst, and her gracious smile afterwards, made him feel that she was a\\r\\nperson to be both loved and feared.  \"I shall give you in charge,\" said\\r\\nshe, ringing a bell, \"to my housekeeper, and I hope she will have no\\r\\nreason to be displeased with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper, when she first came in, appeared with a smiling\\r\\ncountenance; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin, it changed to\\r\\na look of surprise and suspicion.  Her mistress recommended him to her\\r\\nprotection, saying, \"Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your\\r\\nown eye.\"  And she received him with a cold \"Very well, ma\\'am,\" which\\r\\nplainly showed that she was not disposed to like him.  In fact, Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret was a woman so fond of power, and so jealous of favour, that she\\r\\nwould have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress\\r\\nwithout her introduction.  She smothered her displeasure, however, till\\r\\nnight; when, as she attended her mistress\\' toilette, she could not\\r\\nrefrain from expressing her sentiments.  She began cautiously:  \"Ma\\'am,\\r\\nis not this the boy Mr. Spencer was talking of one day--that has been\\r\\nbrought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY, I think they call it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philanthropic Society; yes,\" said her mistress; \"and my brother gives\\r\\nhim a high character:  I hope he will do very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I hope so too,\" observed Mrs. Pomfret; \"but I can\\'t say; for my\\r\\npart, I\\'ve no great notion of those low people.  They say all those\\r\\nchildren are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town,\\r\\nand surely they are like enough, ma\\'am, to take after their own fathers\\r\\nand mothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they are not suffered to be with their parents,\" rejoined the lady;\\r\\n\"and therefore cannot be hurt by their example.  This little boy, to be\\r\\nsure, was unfortunate in his father, but he has had an excellent\\r\\neducation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, EDICATION! to be sure, ma\\'am, I know.  I don\\'t say but what\\r\\nedication is a great thing.  But then, ma\\'am, edication can\\'t change the\\r\\nNATUR that\\'s in one, they say; and one\\'s that born naturally bad and low,\\r\\nthey say, all the edication in the world won\\'t do no good; and, for my\\r\\npart, ma\\'am, I know you knows best; but I should be afraid to let any of\\r\\nthose Villaintropic folks get into my house; for nobody can tell the\\r\\nnatur of them aforehand.  I declare it frights me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pomfret, I thought you had better sense:  how would this poor boy earn\\r\\nhis bread? he would be forced to starve or steal, if everybody had such\\r\\nprejudices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPomfret, who really was a good woman, was softened at this idea, and\\r\\nsaid, \"God forbid he should starve or steal, and God forbid I should say\\r\\nanything PREJUDICIARY of the boy; for there may be no harm in him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone, \"but, Pomfret, if we\\r\\ndon\\'t like the boy at the end of the month, we have done with him; for I\\r\\nhave only promised Mr. Spencer to keep him a month upon trial:  there is\\r\\nno harm done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, no, ma\\'am, to be sure; and cook must put up with her\\r\\ndisappointment, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What disappointment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About her nephew, ma\\'am; the boy she and I was speaking to you for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day you called her up about the almond pudding, ma\\'am.  If you\\r\\nremember, you said you should have no objections to try the boy; and upon\\r\\nthat cook bought him new shirts; but they are to the good, as I tell\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I did not promise to take her nephew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, no ma\\'am, not at all; she does not think to SAY THAT, else I should\\r\\nbe very angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word, any more than\\r\\nfrets that the boy should miss such a good place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him, I\\r\\nshall keep my word; let him come to-morrow.  Let them both have a fair\\r\\ntrial, and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best, and\\r\\nwhich we had better keep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDismissed with these orders, Mrs. Pomfret hastened to report all that had\\r\\npassed to the cook, like a favourite minister, proud to display the\\r\\nextent of her secret influence.  In the morning Felix, the cook\\'s nephew,\\r\\narrived; and, the moment he came into the kitchen, every eye, even the\\r\\nscullion\\'s, was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced\\r\\nupon Franklin with contempt--contempt which Franklin could not endure\\r\\nwithout some confusion, though quite unconscious of having deserved it;\\r\\nnor, upon the most impartial and cool self-examination, could he\\r\\ncomprehend the justice of his judges.  He perceived indeed--for the\\r\\ncomparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers--that\\r\\nFelix was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid expressed it, a much\\r\\nmore genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was; and\\r\\nhe was made to understand, that he wanted a frill to his shirt, a cravat,\\r\\na pair of thin shoes, and, above all, shoe strings, besides other\\r\\nnameless advantages, which justly made his rival the admiration of the\\r\\nkitchen.  However, upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer\\r\\nhad ever said to him, he could not recollect his having warned him that\\r\\nshoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good\\r\\nservant; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving, if\\r\\npossible, to make amends for these deficiencies, and to dissipate the\\r\\nprejudices which he saw were formed against him, by the strictest\\r\\nadherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty.  He hoped\\r\\nto secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all\\r\\nher commands, and faithful care of all that belonged to her.  At the same\\r\\ntime he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow\\r\\nservants by showing a constant desire to oblige them.  He pursued this\\r\\nplan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks, and found that he\\r\\nsucceeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress; but\\r\\nunfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants,\\r\\nand he sometimes offended when he least expected it.  He had made great\\r\\nprogress in the affections of Corkscrew, the butler, by working indeed\\r\\nvery hard for him, and doing every day at least half his business.  But\\r\\none unfortunate night the butler was gone out; the bell rang:  he went\\r\\nupstairs; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was, he answered that\\r\\nhe was gone out.  \"Where to!\" said his mistress.  \"I don\\'t know,\"\\r\\nanswered Franklin.  And, as he had told exactly the truth, and meant to\\r\\ndo no harm, he was surprised, at the butler\\'s return, when he repeated to\\r\\nhim what had passed, at receiving a sudden box on the ear, and the\\r\\nappellation of a mischievous, impertinent, mean-spirited brat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mischievous, impertinent, mean!\" repeated Franklin to himself; but,\\r\\nlooking in the butler\\'s face, which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he\\r\\njudged that he was far from sober, and did not doubt but that the next\\r\\nmorning, when he came to the use of his reason, he would be sensible of\\r\\nhis injustice, and apologize for his box of the ear.  But no apology\\r\\ncoming all day, Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation, or\\r\\nrather, to ask what he had best do on the next occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Corkscrew, \"when mistress asked for me, how came you to say I\\r\\nwas gone out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you know, I saw you go out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when she asked you where I was gone, how came you to say that you\\r\\ndid not know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, indeed, I did not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a stupid blockhead! could you not say I was gone to the\\r\\nwasherwoman\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But WERE you?\" said Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was I?\" cried Corkscrew, and looked as if he would have struck him\\r\\nagain; \"how dare you give me the lie, Mr. Hypocrite?  You would be ready\\r\\nenough, I\\'ll be bound, to make excuses for yourself.  Why are not\\r\\nmistress\\' clogs cleaned?  Go along and blacken \\'em, this minute, and send\\r\\nFelix to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler\\'s\\r\\npantry.  Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew; and, though Franklin by\\r\\nno means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences,\\r\\nnor ever entered without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once\\r\\nto be sent of a message at an unlucky time; and, as the door was half\\r\\nopen, he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor,\\r\\nwhich he could not help suspecting to be wine; and, as the decanter,\\r\\nwhich usually went upstairs after dinner, was at this time in the\\r\\nbutler\\'s grasp, without any stopper in it, he was involuntarily forced to\\r\\nsuspect they were drinking his mistress\\' wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix\\r\\nreceived:  his aunt, the cook, had occasion for his assistance, and she\\r\\nhad many delicious douceurs in her gift.  Many a handful of currants,\\r\\nmany a half-custard, many a triangular remnant of pie, besides the choice\\r\\nof his own meal at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the\\r\\nfavourite Felix; whilst Franklin was neglected, though he took the utmost\\r\\npains to please the cook in all honourable service, and, when she was\\r\\nhot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand to help her; and in the\\r\\nhour of adversity, when the clock struck five, and no dinner was dished,\\r\\nand no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had, Franklin\\r\\nwould answer to her call, with flowers to garnish her dishes, and\\r\\npresence of mind to know, in the midst of the commotion, where everything\\r\\nthat was wanting was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all\\r\\ndifficulties vanished before him.  Yet when the danger was over, and the\\r\\nhour of adversity had past, the ungrateful cook would forget her\\r\\nbenefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw him, with a\\r\\ncarelessness that touched him sensibly, anything which the other servants\\r\\nwere too nice to eat.  All this Franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he\\r\\nenvy Felix the dainties which he ate, sometimes close beside him:  \"For,\"\\r\\nsaid he to himself, \"I have a clear conscience, and that is more than\\r\\nFelix can have.  I know how he wins cook\\'s favour too well, and I fancy I\\r\\nknow how I have offended her; for since the day I saw the basket, she has\\r\\ndone nothing but huff me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the basket was this.  Mrs. Pomfret, the housekeeper, had\\r\\nseveral times, directly and indirectly, given the world below to\\r\\nunderstand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious\\r\\nquantity of meat eaten of late.  Now, when she spoke, it was usually at\\r\\ndinner time; she always looked, or Franklin imagined that she looked,\\r\\nsuspiciously at him.  Other people looked more maliciously; but, as he\\r\\nfelt himself perfectly innocent, he went on eating his dinner in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at length it was time to explain.  One Sunday there appeared a\\r\\nhandsome sirloin of beef, which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost\\r\\nto the bare bone, and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the\\r\\nopening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst\\r\\nforth, and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul\\r\\nplay, and she would have the beef found, or she would know why.  She\\r\\nspoke, but no beef appeared, till Franklin, with a look of sudden\\r\\nrecollection, cried, \"Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a\\r\\nbasket in the dairy?--I think--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook, as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow, grew pale; but,\\r\\nsuddenly recovering the use of her speech, turned upon Franklin, and,\\r\\nwith a voice of thunder, gave him the lie direct; and forthwith, taking\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declaring she could\\r\\ndefy the world--\"that so she could, and would.\"  \"There, ma\\'am,\" said she\\r\\nkicking an empty basket which lay on the floor--\"there\\'s malice for you.\\r\\nAsk him why he don\\'t show you the beef in the basket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I saw--\" poor Franklin began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You thought you saw!\" cried the cook, coming close up to him with\\r\\nkimboed arms, and looking like a dragon; \"and pray, sir, what business\\r\\nhas such a one as you to think you see?  And pray, ma\\'am, will you be\\r\\npleased to speak--perhaps, ma\\'am, he\\'ll condescend to obey you--ma\\'am,\\r\\nwill you be pleased to forbid him my dairy? for here he comes prying and\\r\\nspying about; and how, ma\\'am, am I to answer for my butter and cream, or\\r\\nanything at all?  I\\'m sure it\\'s what I can\\'t pretend to, unless you do me\\r\\nthe justice to forbid him my places.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret, whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks\\r\\nof the \"Villaintropic Society,\" and also by her secret jealousy of a boy\\r\\nwhom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress\\', took part\\r\\nwith the cook, and ended, as she began, with a firm persuasion that\\r\\nFranklin was the guilty person.  \"Let him alone, let him alone!\" said\\r\\nshe; \"he has as many turns and windings as a hare; but we shall catch him\\r\\nyet, I\\'ll be bound, in some of his doublings.  I knew the nature of him\\r\\nwell enough, from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him; but\\r\\nmistress shall have her own way, and see the end of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, and the bitter sense of injustice, drew tears at length fast\\r\\ndown the proud cheek of Franklin, which might possibly have touched Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, if Felix, with a sneer, had not called them CROCODILE TEARS.\\r\\n\"Felix, too!\" thought he; \"this is too much.\"  In fact, Felix had till\\r\\nnow professed himself his firm ally, and had on his part received from\\r\\nFranklin unequivocal proofs of friendship; for it must be told that every\\r\\nother morning, when it was Felix\\'s turn to get breakfast, Felix never was\\r\\nup in decent time, and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if\\r\\nFranklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him, the bread\\r\\nand butter spread, and the toast toasted; and had not, moreover,\\r\\nregularly, when the clock struck eight, and Mrs. Pomfret\\'s foot was heard\\r\\noverhead, run to call the sleeping Felix, and helped him constantly\\r\\nthrough the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper\\r\\ncame downstairs.  All this could not but be present to his memory; but,\\r\\nseeming to reproach him, Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears, and\\r\\npreserved a magnanimous silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour of retribution was, however, not so far off as Felix imagined.\\r\\nCunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time; but\\r\\nalthough they may escape once, twice, perhaps ninety-nine times, what\\r\\ndoes that signify?--for the hundredth time they come to shame, and lose\\r\\nall their character.  Grown bold by frequent success, Felix became more\\r\\ncareless in his operations; and it happened that one day he met his\\r\\nmistress full in the passage, as he was going on one of the cook\\'s secret\\r\\nerrands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going, Felix?\" said his mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the washerwoman\\'s, ma\\'am,\" answered he, with his usual effrontery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said she.  \"Call at the bookseller\\'s in--stay, I must write\\r\\ndown the direction.  Pomfret,\" said she, opening the housekeeper\\'s room\\r\\ndoor, \"have you a bit of paper?\"  Pomfret came with the writing-paper,\\r\\nand looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her\\r\\nknowledge; so, while Mrs. Churchill was writing the direction, she stood\\r\\ntalking to him about it; whilst he, in the greatest terror imaginable,\\r\\nlooked up in her face as she spoke; but was all the time intent on\\r\\nparrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his\\r\\nmistress\\', which, unluckily for him, had followed her into the passage.\\r\\nManchon was extremely fond of Felix, who, by way of pleasing his\\r\\nmistress, had paid most assiduous court to her dog; yet now his caresses\\r\\nwere rather troublesome.  Manchon leaped up, and was not to be rebuffed.\\r\\n\"Poor fellow--poor fellow--down! down!  poor fellow!\" cried Felix, and\\r\\nput him away.  But Manchon leaped up again, and began smelling near the\\r\\nfatal pocket in a most alarming manner.  \"You will see by this direction\\r\\nwhere you are to go,\" said his mistress.  \"Manchon, come here--and you\\r\\nwill be so good as to bring me--down! down! Manchon, be quiet!\"  But\\r\\nManchon knew better--he had now got his head into Felix\\'s pocket, and\\r\\nwould not be quiet till he had drawn from thence, rustling out of its\\r\\nbrown paper, half a cold turkey, which had been missing since morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cold turkey, as I\\'m alive!\" exclaimed the housekeeper, darting upon\\r\\nit with horror and amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all this?\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a composed voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, ma\\'am,\" answered Felix, so confused that he knew not what\\r\\nto say; \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what?\" cried Mrs. Pomfret, indignation flashing from her eyes.  \"But\\r\\nwhat?\" repeated his mistress, waiting for his reply with a calm air of\\r\\nattention, which still more disconcerted Felix; for, though with an angry\\r\\nperson he might have some chance of escape, he knew that he could not\\r\\ninvent any excuse in such circumstances, which could stand the\\r\\nexamination of a person in her sober senses.  He was struck dumb.\\r\\n\"Speak,\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a still lower tone; \"I am ready to hear\\r\\nall you have to say.  In my house everybody shall have justice; speak--\\r\\nbut what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BUT,\" stammered Felix; and, after in vain attempting to equivocate,\\r\\nconfessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin\\'s; but he\\r\\nthrew all the blame upon his aunt, the cook, who, he said, had ordered\\r\\nhim upon this expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook was now summoned; but she totally denied all knowledge of the\\r\\naffair, with the same violence with which she had lately confounded\\r\\nFranklin about the beef in the basket; not entirely, however, with the\\r\\nsame success; for Felix, perceiving by his mistress\\' eye that she was on\\r\\nthe point of desiring him to leave the house immediately; and not being\\r\\nvery willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the\\r\\nbutler, did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her\\r\\nown.  He knew how to bring his charge home to her.  He produced a note in\\r\\nher own handwriting, the purport of which was to request her cousin\\'s\\r\\nacceptance of \"some DELICATE COLD TURKEY,\" and to beg she would send her,\\r\\nby the return of the bearer, a little of her cherry-brandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook\\'s\\r\\ndischarge, and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his\\r\\nservices, but, upon his pleading with many tears, which Franklin did not\\r\\ncall CROCODILE TEARS, that he was so young, that he was under the\\r\\ndominion of his aunt, he touched Mrs. Pomfret\\'s compassion, and she\\r\\nobtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month, to give\\r\\nhim yet a chance of redeeming his character.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon, resolved, for\\r\\nthe future, to be more upon her guard with Felix, and felt that she had\\r\\ntreated Franklin with great injustice, when she accused him of\\r\\nmalpractices about the sirloin of beef.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood people, when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone\\r\\nwith injustice, are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their\\r\\nmistake; and Mrs. Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which\\r\\nFranklin did in the most favourable point of view; especially as the next\\r\\nday she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for\\r\\nher tea, and buttered her toast--services for which she had always\\r\\nthought she was indebted to Felix.  Besides, she had rated Felix\\'s\\r\\nabilities very highly, because he made up her weekly accounts for her;\\r\\nbut unluckily once, when Franklin was out of the way, and she brought a\\r\\nbill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up, she discovered that he did\\r\\nnot know how to cast up pounds, shillings and pence, and he was obliged\\r\\nto confess that she must wait till Franklin came home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded\\r\\nthe character of the two boys, we must proceed to a more serious affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorkscrew frequently, after he had finished taking away supper, and after\\r\\nthe housekeeper was gone to bed, sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse\\r\\nto drink with his friends.  The alehouse was kept by that cousin of\\r\\nFelix\\'s, who was so fond of \"DELICATE cold turkey,\" and who had such\\r\\nchoice cherry-brandy.  Corkscrew kept the key of the house door, so that\\r\\nhe could return home whenever he thought proper; and, if he should by\\r\\naccident be called for by his mistress after supper, Felix knew where to\\r\\nfind him, and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor\\r\\nFranklin had too much integrity to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these precautions taken, the butler was at liberty to indulge his\\r\\nfavourite passion, which so increased with indulgence, that his wages\\r\\nwere by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life.  Every\\r\\nday he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits; for every\\r\\nday drinking became more necessary to him.  His health was ruined.  With\\r\\na red, pimpled, bloated face, emaciated legs, and a swelled, diseased\\r\\nbody, he appeared the victim of intoxication.  In the morning, when he\\r\\ngot up, his hands trembled, his spirits flagged, he could do nothing\\r\\nuntil he had taken a dram--an operation which he was obliged to repeat\\r\\nseveral times in the course of the day, as all those wretched people MUST\\r\\nwho once acquire this habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented; and the\\r\\nlandlord, who grew urgent for his money, refused to give further credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful, he\\r\\nleaned with his elbow surlily upon the table, began to quarrel with the\\r\\nlandlord, and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman.\\r\\nTo which the landlord coolly replied, \"That as long as he had paid like a\\r\\ngentleman, he had been treated like one, and that was as much as anyone\\r\\ncould expect, or, at any rate, as much as anyone would meet with in this\\r\\nworld.\"  For the truth of this assertion he appealed, laughing, to a\\r\\nparty of men who were drinking in the room.  The men, however, took part\\r\\nwith Corkscrew, and, drawing him over to their table, made him sit down\\r\\nwith them.  They were in high good-humour, and the butler soon grew so\\r\\nintimate with them, that, in the openness of his heart, he soon\\r\\ncommunicated to them, not only all his own affairs, but all that he knew,\\r\\nand more than all that he knew, of his mistress\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation, and\\r\\nencouraged him as much as possible to talk; for they had secret views,\\r\\nwhich the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill had some fine old family plate; and these men belonged to\\r\\na gang of housebreakers.  Before they parted with Corkscrew, they engaged\\r\\nhim to meet them again the next night; their intimacy was still more\\r\\nclosely cemented.  One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew\\r\\nthree guineas towards the payment of his debt, and hinted that, if he\\r\\nthought proper, he could easily get the whole cleared off.  Upon this\\r\\nhint, Corkscrew became all attention, till, after some hesitation on\\r\\ntheir part, and repeated promises of secrecy on his, they at length\\r\\ndisclosed their plans to him.  They gave him to understand, that if he\\r\\nwould assist in letting them into his mistress\\' house, they would let him\\r\\nhave an ample share in the booty.  The butler, who had the reputation of\\r\\nbeing an honest man, and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof\\r\\nagainst everything but his mistress\\' port, turned pale, and trembled at\\r\\nthis proposal; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought; and promised\\r\\nto give an answer the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went home more than half-intoxicated.  His mind was so full of what\\r\\nhad passed, that he could not help bragging to Felix, whom he found awake\\r\\nat his return, that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse\\r\\nwhenever he pleased; dropping, besides, some hints, which were not lost\\r\\nupon Felix.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had said; and\\r\\nCorkscrew, alarmed, endeavoured to evade his questions, by saying that he\\r\\nwas not in his senses when he talked in that manner.  Nothing, however,\\r\\nthat he could urge made any impression upon Felix, whose recollection on\\r\\nthe subject was perfectly distinct, and who had too much cunning himself,\\r\\nand too little confidence in his companion, to be the dupe of his\\r\\ndissimulation.  The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was\\r\\nabsolutely determined either to betray their scheme, or to become a\\r\\nsharer in the booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night came, and he was now to make a final decision; either to\\r\\ndetermine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances, or taking\\r\\nFelix with him to join in the plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis debt, his love of drinking, the impossibility of indulging it without\\r\\na fresh supply of money, all came into his mind at once, and conquered\\r\\nhis remaining scruples.  It is said by those whose fatal experience gives\\r\\nthem a right to be believed, that a drunkard will sacrifice anything,\\r\\neverything, sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through\\r\\nit when once formed!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour of rendezvous came, and Corkscrew went to the alehouse, where he\\r\\nfound the housebreakers waiting for him, and a glass of brandy ready\\r\\npoured out.  He sighed--drank--hesitated--drank again--heard the landlord\\r\\ntalk of his bill, saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment--\\r\\ndrank again--cursed himself, and, giving his hand to the villain who was\\r\\nwhispering in his ear, swore that he could not help it, and must do as\\r\\nthey would have him.  They required of him to give up the key of the\\r\\nhouse door, that they might get another made by it.  He had left it with\\r\\nFelix, and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had\\r\\narisen.  Felix knew enough to ruin them, and must therefore be won over.\\r\\nThis was no very difficult task; he had a strong desire to have some\\r\\nworked cravats, and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this\\r\\nwould be a sufficient bribe.  The cravats were bought and shown to Felix.\\r\\nHe thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete, fine\\r\\ngentleman; and to go without them, especially when he had once seen\\r\\nhimself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow, appeared\\r\\nimpossible.  Even this paltry temptation, working upon his vanity, at\\r\\nlength prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by\\r\\nthe habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood.  It was agreed that,\\r\\nthe first time his mistress sent him out on a message, he should carry\\r\\nthe key of the house door to his cousin\\'s, and deliver it into the hands\\r\\nof one of the gang, who were there in waiting for it.  Such was the\\r\\nscheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nFelix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed, and fell\\r\\nfast asleep; but the butler, who had not yet stifled the voice of\\r\\nconscience, felt, in the silence of the night, so insupportably\\r\\nmiserable, that, instead of going to rest, he stole softly into the\\r\\npantry for a bottle of his mistress\\' wine, and there drinking glass after\\r\\nglass, he stayed till he became so far intoxicated, that, though he\\r\\ncontrived to find his way back to bed, he could by no means undress\\r\\nhimself.  Without any power of recollection, he flung himself upon the\\r\\nbed, leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him.\\r\\nFranklin slept in the next room to him, and presently awaking, thought he\\r\\nperceived a strong smell of something burning.  He jumped up, and seeing\\r\\na light under the butler\\'s door, gently opened it, and to his\\r\\nastonishment, beheld one of the bed curtains in flames.  He immediately\\r\\nran to the butler, and pulled him with all his force, to rouse him from\\r\\nhis lethargy.  He came to his senses at length, but was so terrified, and\\r\\nso helpless, that, if it had not been for Franklin, the whole house would\\r\\nsoon inevitably have been on fire.  Felix, trembling and cowardly, knew\\r\\nnot what to do; and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin, whose\\r\\nturn it now was to command.  Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room\\r\\nalmost out of her senses, whilst he, with the greatest presence of mind,\\r\\nrecollected where he had seen two large tubs of water, which the maids\\r\\nhad prepared the night before for their washing, and seizing the wet\\r\\nlinen which had been left to soak, he threw them upon the flames.  He\\r\\nexerted himself with so much good sense, that the fire was presently\\r\\nextinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was now once more safe and quiet.  Mrs. Pomfret, recovering\\r\\nfrom her fright, postponed all inquiries till the morning, and rejoiced\\r\\nthat her mistress had not been awakened, whilst Corkscrew flattered\\r\\nhimself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you tell Mrs. Pomfret where you found the candle when you came\\r\\ninto the room,\" said he to Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If she asks me, you know I must tell the truth,\" replied he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must!\" repeated Felix, sneeringly; \"what, you MUST be a tell-tale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I never told any tales of anybody, and I should be very sorry to get\\r\\nanyone into a scrape; but for all that I shall not tell a lie, either for\\r\\nmyself or anybody else, let you call me what names you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I were to give you something that you would like,\" said\\r\\nCorkscrew--\"something that I know you would like!\" repeated Felix.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing you can give me will do,\" answered Franklin, steadily, \"so it is\\r\\nuseless to say any more about it--I hope I shall not be questioned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this hope he was mistaken; for the first thing Mrs. Pomfret did in the\\r\\nmorning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt\\r\\ncurtains, whilst Corkscrew stood by, endeavouring to exculpate himself by\\r\\nall the excuses he could invent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret, however, though sometimes blinded by her prejudices, was no\\r\\nfool; and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle,\\r\\nwhich had been left on the hearth, where Corkscrew protested he had left\\r\\nit, could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant.\\r\\nTurning short round to Franklin, she desired that he would show her where\\r\\nhe found the candle when he came into the room.  He took up the\\r\\ncandlestick; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it, she\\r\\nsnatched it from his hands; \"How did this candlestick come here?  This\\r\\nwas not the candlestick you found here last night,\" cried she.  \"Yes,\\r\\nindeed it was,\" answered Franklin.  \"That is impossible,\" retorted she,\\r\\nvehemently, \"for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night, in\\r\\nthe hall, the last thing I did, after you,\" said she, turning to the\\r\\nbutler, \"was gone to bed--I\\'m sure of it--Nay, don\\'t you recollect my\\r\\ntaking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand, and making you to go\\r\\nup to bed with the brass one, and I bolted the door at the stair-head\\r\\nafter you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all very true; but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his\\r\\nroom by a back staircase, unbolted that door, and, upon his return from\\r\\nthe alehouse, had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs, and\\r\\nhad left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" said Felix, \"indeed you forget; for Mr. Corkscrew came into\\r\\nmy room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning, and I happened\\r\\nto take particular notice, and he had the japanned candlestick in his\\r\\nhand, and that was just as I heard you, bolting the door. Indeed, ma\\'am\\r\\nyou forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir,\" retorted Mrs. Pomfret, rising in anger, \"I do not forget;\\r\\nI\\'m not come to be SUPPERANNUATED yet, I hope.  How do you dare to tell\\r\\nme I forget?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" cried Felix, \"I beg your pardon, I did not--I did not mean\\r\\nto say you forgot, but only I thought, perhaps, you might not\\r\\nparticularly remember; for if you please to recollect--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t please to recollect just whatever you please, sir!  Hold your\\r\\ntongue; why should you poke yourself into this scrape; what have you to\\r\\ndo with it, I should be glad to know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing in the world, oh nothing in the world; I\\'m sure I beg your\\r\\npardon, ma\\'am,\" answered Felix, in a soft tone; and, sneaking off, left\\r\\nhis friend Corkscrew to fight his own battle, secretly resolving to\\r\\ndesert in good time, if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions\\r\\ncoming to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and,\\r\\nconscious of guilt, he turned pale, and appeared so much more terrified\\r\\nthan butlers usually appear when detected in a lie, that Mrs. Pomfret\\r\\nresolved, as she said, to sift the matter to the bottom.  Impatiently did\\r\\nshe wait till the clock struck nine, and her mistress\\' bell rang, the\\r\\nsignal for her attendance at her levee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you find yourself this morning, ma\\'am?\" said she, undrawing the\\r\\ncurtains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very sleepy, indeed,\" answered her mistress in a drowsy voice; \"I think\\r\\nI must sleep half an hour longer--shut the curtains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you please, ma\\'am; but I suppose I had better open a little of the\\r\\nwindow shutter, for it\\'s past nine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But just struck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh dear, ma\\'am, it struck before I came upstairs, and you know we are\\r\\ntwenty minutes slow--Lord bless us!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, as she let\\r\\nfall the bar of the window, which roused her mistress.  \"I\\'m sure I beg\\r\\nyour pardon a thousand times--it\\'s only the bar--because I had this great\\r\\nkey in my hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put down the key, then, or you\\'ll knock something else down; and you may\\r\\nopen the shutters now; for I\\'m quite awake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me! I\\'m so sorry to think of disturbing you,\" cried Mrs. Pomfret,\\r\\nat the same time throwing the shutters wide open; \"but, to be sure,\\r\\nma\\'am, I have something to tell you, which won\\'t let you sleep again in a\\r\\nhurry.  I brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my\\r\\nown, which I\\'m sure you\\'ll approve of; but I\\'m not come to that part of\\r\\nmy story yet.  I hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house\\r\\nlast night, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard no noise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am surprised at that, though,\" continued Mrs. Pomfret, and proceeded\\r\\nto give a most ample account of the fire, of her fears, and her\\r\\nsuspicions.  \"To be sure, ma\\'am, what I say IS, that, without the spirit\\r\\nof prophecy, one can nowadays account for what has passed.  I\\'m quite\\r\\nclear in my own judgment, that Mr. Corkscrew must have been out last\\r\\nnight after I went to bed; for, besides the japanned candlestick, which\\r\\nof itself I\\'m sure is strong enough to hang a man, there\\'s another\\r\\ncircumstance, ma\\'am, that certifies it to me--though I have not mentioned\\r\\nit, ma\\'am, to no one yet,\" lowering her voice--\"Franklin, when I\\r\\nquestioned him, told me, that he left the lantern in the outside porch in\\r\\nthe court last night, and this morning it was on the kitchen table.  Now,\\r\\nma\\'am, that lantern could not come without hands; and I could not forget\\r\\nabout that, you know; for Franklin says, he\\'s sure he left the lantern\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you believe HIM?\" inquired her mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, ma\\'am--how can I help believing him?  I never found him out\\r\\nin the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house; so one\\r\\ncan\\'t help believing in him, like him or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without meaning to tell a falsehood, however,\" said the lady, \"he might\\r\\nmake a mistake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he never makes mistakes; it is not his way to go gossiping\\r\\nand tattling; he never tells anything till he\\'s asked, and then it\\'s fit\\r\\nhe should.  About the sirloin of beef, and all, he was right in the end,\\r\\nI found, to do him justice; and I\\'m sure he\\'s right now about the\\r\\nlantern--he\\'s ALWAY\\'S RIGHT\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill could not help smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had seen him, ma\\'am, last night in the midst of the fire--I\\'m\\r\\nsure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds--and I\\r\\nshall never forget his coming to call me.  Poor fellow! he that I was\\r\\nalways scolding and scolding, enough to make him hate me.  But he\\'s too\\r\\ngood to hate anybody; and I\\'ll be bound I\\'ll make it up to him now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care that you don\\'t go from one extreme into another, Pomfret;\\r\\ndon\\'t spoil the boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, there\\'s no danger of that; but I\\'m sure if you had seen him\\r\\nlast night yourself, you would think he deserved to be rewarded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so he shall be rewarded,\" said Mrs. Churchill; \"but I will try him\\r\\nmore fully yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no occasion, I think, for trying him any more, ma\\'am,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray desire,\" continued her mistress, \"that he will bring up breakfast\\r\\nthis morning; and leave the key of the house-door, Pomfret, with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour, his mistress\\r\\nwas standing by the fire with the key in her hand.  She spoke to him of\\r\\nhis last night\\'s exertions in terms of much approbation.  \"How long have\\r\\nyou lived with me?\" said she, pausing; \"three weeks, I think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three weeks and four days, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is but a short time; yet you have conducted yourself so as to make\\r\\nme think I may depend upon you.  You know this key?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, madam, it is the key of the house-door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is; I shall trust it in your care.  It is a great trust for so young\\r\\na person as you are.\"  Franklin stood silent, with a firm but modest\\r\\nlook.  \"If you take the charge of this key,\" continued his mistress,\\r\\n\"remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own\\r\\nhands.  In the daytime it must not be left in the door.  You must not\\r\\ntell anybody where you keep it at night; and the house-door must not be\\r\\nunlocked after eleven o\\'clock at night, unless by my orders.  Will you\\r\\ntake charge of the key upon these conditions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, madam, do anything you order me,\" said Franklin, and received\\r\\nthe key from her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mrs. Churchill\\'s orders were made known, they caused many secret\\r\\nmarvellings and murmurings.  Corkscrew and Felix were disconcerted, and\\r\\ndared not openly avow their discontent; and they treated Franklin with\\r\\nthe greatest seeming kindness and cordiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went on smoothly for three days.  The butler never attempted\\r\\nhis usual midnight visits to the alehouse, but went to bed in proper\\r\\ntime, and paid particular court to Mrs Pomfret, in order to dispel her\\r\\nsuspicions.  She had never had any idea of the real fact, that he and\\r\\nFelix were joined in a plot with house-breakers to rob the house, but\\r\\nthought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his\\r\\npassion for drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus stood affairs the night before Mrs. Churchill\\'s birthday.\\r\\nCorkscrew, by the housekeeper\\'s means, ventured to present a petition\\r\\nthat he might go to the play the next day, and his request was granted.\\r\\nFranklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered\\r\\nround the butler, who, with great importance, was reading aloud the play-\\r\\nbill.  Everybody present soon began to speak at once, and with great\\r\\nenthusiasm talked of the playhouse, the actors, and actresses; and then\\r\\nFelix, in the first pause, turned to Franklin, and said, \"Lord, you know\\r\\nnothing of all this! YOU never went to a play, did you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never,\" said Franklin, and felt, he did not know why, a little ashamed;\\r\\nand he longed extremely to go to one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you like to go to the play with me to-morrow?\" said\\r\\nCorkscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Franklin, \"I should like it exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you think mistress would let you if I asked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think maybe she would, if Mrs. Pomfret asked her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then you have no money, have you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Franklin, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay,\" said Corkscrew, \"what I am thinking of is, that if mistress\\r\\nwill let you go, I\\'ll treat you myself, rather than that you should he\\r\\ndisappointed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDelight, surprise and gratitude appeared in Franklin\\'s face at these\\r\\nwords.  Corkscrew rejoiced to see that now, at least, he had found a most\\r\\npowerful temptation.  \"Well then, I\\'ll go just now and ask her.  In the\\r\\nmeantime, lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The key!\" answered Franklin, starting; \"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t do that,\\r\\nfor I\\'ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how will she know anything of the matter?  Run, run, and get it for\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I CANNOT,\" replied Franklin, resisting the push which the butler\\r\\ngave his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t?\" cried Corkscrew, changing his tone; \"then, sir, I can\\'t take\\r\\nyou to the play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Franklin, sorrowfully, but with steadiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Felix, mimicking him, \"you need not look so\\r\\nimportant, nor fancy yourself such a great man, because you\\'re master of\\r\\na key.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say no more to him,\" interrupted Corkscrew:  \"let him alone to take his\\r\\nown way.  Felix, you would have no objection, I suppose, to going to the\\r\\nplay with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I should like it of all things, if I did not come between anybody\\r\\nelse.  But come, come!\" added the hypocrite, assuming a tone of friendly\\r\\npersuasion, \"you won\\'t be such a blockhead, Franklin, as to lose going to\\r\\nthe play for nothing; it\\'s only just obstinacy.  What harm can it do, to\\r\\nlend Mr. Corkscrew the key for five minutes? he\\'ll give it to you back\\r\\nagain safe and sound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t doubt THAT,\" answered Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it must be all because you don\\'t wish to oblige Mr. Corkscrew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but I can\\'t oblige him in this; for, as I told you before, my\\r\\nmistress trusted me.  I promised never to let the key out of my own\\r\\nhands, and you would not have me break my trust.  Mr. Spencer told me\\r\\nthat was worse than ROBBING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the word ROBBING both Corkscrew and Felix involuntarily cast down\\r\\ntheir eyes, and turned the conversation immediately, saying, that he did\\r\\nvery right; that they did not really want the key, and had only asked for\\r\\nit just to try if he would keep his word.  \"Shake hands,\" said Corkscrew,\\r\\n\"I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before, Mr. Corkscrew,\"\\r\\nsaid Franklin, giving his hand rather proudly, and he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall make no hand of this prig,\" said Corkscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we\\'ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy,\" said\\r\\nFelix; \"and let him make his story good as he can afterwards.  He shall\\r\\nrepent of these airs.  To-night I\\'ll watch him, and find out where he\\r\\nhides the key; and when he\\'s asleep we\\'ll get it without thanking him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis plan Felix put into execution.  They discovered the place where\\r\\nFranklin kept the key at night, stole it whilst he slept, took off the\\r\\nimpression in wax, and carefully replaced it in Franklin\\'s trunk, exactly\\r\\nwhere they found it.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make\\r\\nof this impression of the key in wax.  Knowing how to do mischief is very\\r\\ndifferent from wishing to do it:  and the most innocent persons are\\r\\ngenerally the least ignorant.  By means of the impression, which they had\\r\\nthus obtained, Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by\\r\\nPicklock, a smith who belonged to their gang of house-breakers; and with\\r\\nthis false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle suspecting what had happened, Franklin, the next morning went to\\r\\nunlock the house door, as usual; but finding the key entangled in the\\r\\nlock, he took it out to examine it, and perceived a lump of wax sticking\\r\\nin one of the wards.  Struck with this circumstance, it brought to his\\r\\nmind all that had passed the preceding evening, and being sure that he\\r\\nhad no wax near the key, he began to suspect what had happened; and he\\r\\ncould not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say, that \"give\\r\\nhim but a halfpenny worth of wax, and he could open the strongest lock\\r\\nthat ever was made by hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these things considered, Franklin resolved to take the key just as it\\r\\nwas, with the wax sticking to it, to his mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust YOU with this key,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Churchill, after she had heard his story.  \"My brother will be here\\r\\nto-day, and I shall consult him.  In the meantime, say nothing of what\\r\\nhas passed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvening came, and after tea Mr. Spencer sent for Franklin upstairs.  \"So,\\r\\nMr. Franklin,\" said he, \"I\\'m glad to find you are in such high TRUST in\\r\\nthis family.\"  Franklin bowed.  \"But you have lost, I understand, the\\r\\npleasure of going to the play to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think anything--much, I mean, of that, sir,\" answered Franklin,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are Corkscrew and Felix GONE to the play?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; half an hour ago, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall look into his room, and examine the pantry and the plate\\r\\nthat is under his care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Spencer came to examine the pantry, he found the large salvers\\r\\nand cups in a basket behind the door, and the other things placed so as\\r\\nto be easily carried off.  Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew\\'s\\r\\nbedchamber, to strengthen their suspicions, till, just as they were going\\r\\nto leave the room, Mrs. Pomfret exclaimed, \"Why, if there is not Mr.\\r\\nCorkscrew\\'s dress coat hanging up there! and if here isn\\'t Felix\\'s fine\\r\\ncravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play!  Why, sir, they\\r\\ncan\\'t be gone to the play.  Look at the cravat.  Ah! upon my word I am\\r\\nafraid they are not at the play.  No, sir, you may be sure that they are\\r\\nplotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse; and they\\'ll certainly\\r\\nbreak into the house to-night.  We shall all be murdered in our beds, as\\r\\nsure as I\\'m a living woman, sir; but if you\\'ll only take my advice--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, good Mrs. Pomfret,\" Mr. Spencer observed, \"don\\'t be alarmed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, sir, but I won\\'t pretend to sleep in the house, if Franklin isn\\'t\\r\\nto have a blunderbuss, and I a BAGGONET.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall have both, indeed, Mrs. Pomfret; but don\\'t make such a noise,\\r\\nfor everybody will hear you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret\\'s love of talking.  She was silent, and contented herself the\\r\\nrest of the evening with making signs, looking ominous, and stalking\\r\\nabout the house like one possessed with a secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nEscaped from Mrs. Pomfret\\'s fears and advice, Mr. Spencer went to a shop\\r\\nwithin a few doors of the alehouse, which he heard Corkscrew frequented,\\r\\nand sent to beg to speak to the landlord.  He came; and, when Mr. Spencer\\r\\nquestioned him, confessed that Corkscrew and Felix were actually drinking\\r\\nin his house with two men of suspicious appearance; that, as he passed\\r\\nthrough the passage, he heard them disputing about a key; and that one of\\r\\nthem said, \"Since we\\'ve got the key, we\\'ll go about it to-night.\"  This\\r\\nwas sufficient information.  Mr. Spencer, lest the landlord should give\\r\\nthem information of what was going forwards, took him along with him to\\r\\nBow Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nA constable and proper assistance was sent to Mrs. Churchill\\'s.  They\\r\\nstationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading\\r\\nto the butler\\'s pantry, where the plate was kept.  A little after\\r\\nmidnight they heard the hall door open.  Corkscrew and his accomplices\\r\\nwent directly to the pantry; and there Mr. Spencer and the constable\\r\\nimmediately secured them, as they were carrying off their booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Churchill and Pomfret had spent the night at the house of an\\r\\nacquaintance in the same street.  \"Well, ma\\'am,\" said Mrs. Pomfret, who\\r\\nhad heard all the news in the morning, \"the villains are all safe, thank\\r\\nGod.  I was afraid to go to the window this morning; but it was my luck\\r\\nto see them all go by to gaol.  They looked so shocking!  I am sure I\\r\\nnever shall forget Felix\\'s look to my dying day!  But poor Franklin!\\r\\nma\\'am; that boy has the best heart in the world.  I could not get him to\\r\\ngive a second look at them as they passed.  Poor fellow! I thought he\\r\\nwould have dropped; and he was so modest, ma\\'am, when Mr. Spencer spoke\\r\\nto him, and told him he had done his duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did my brother tell him what reward I intend for him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, and I\\'m sure Franklin thinks no more of REWARD than I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I intend,\" continued Mrs. Churchill, \"to sell some of my old useless\\r\\nplate, and to lay it out in an annuity for Franklin\\'s life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La, ma\\'am!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, with unfeigned joy, \"I\\'m sure you\\r\\nare very good; and I\\'m very glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" continued Mrs. Churchill, \"here are some tickets for the play,\\r\\nwhich I shall beg you, Pomfret, to give him, and to take him with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very much obliged to you, indeed, ma\\'am; and I\\'ll go with him with\\r\\nall my heart, and choose such plays as won\\'t do no prejudice to his\\r\\nmorality.  And, ma\\'am,\" continued Mrs. Pomfret, \"the night after the fire\\r\\nI left him my great Bible and my watch, in my will; for I never was more\\r\\nmistaken at the first in any boy in my born days; but he has won me by\\r\\nhis own DESERTS, and I shall from this time forth love all the\\r\\nVILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIMPLE SUSAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Waked as her custom was, before the day,\\r\\n     To do the observance due to sprightly May.\\r\\n                                          Dryden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a retired hamlet on the borders of Wales, between Oswestry and\\r\\nShrewsbury, it is still the custom to celebrate the 1st of May.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children of the village, who look forward to this rural festival with\\r\\njoyful eagerness, usually meet on the last day of April to make up their\\r\\nnosegays for the morning and to choose their queen.  Their customary\\r\\nplace of meeting is at a hawthorn, which stands in a little green nook,\\r\\nopen on one side to a shady lane, and separated on the other side by a\\r\\nthick sweet-brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis attorney began the world with nothing, but he contrived to scrape\\r\\ntogether a good deal of money, everybody knew how.  He built a new house\\r\\nat the entrance of the village, and had a large, well fenced garden, yet,\\r\\nnotwithstanding his fences, he never felt himself secure.  Such were his\\r\\nlitigious habits, and his suspicious temper, that he was constantly at\\r\\nvariance with his simple and peaceable neighbours.  Some pig, or dog, or\\r\\ngoat, or goose was for ever trespassing.  His complaints and his\\r\\nextortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet.  The paths in his fields\\r\\nwere at length unfrequented, his stiles were blocked up with stones or\\r\\nstuffed with brambles and briers, so that not a gosling could creep\\r\\nunder, or a giant get over them.  Indeed, so careful were even the\\r\\nvillage children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law, that\\r\\nthey would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should\\r\\nentangle in his trees, or fall upon his meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case, for this was the name of our attorney, had a son and a\\r\\ndaughter, to whose education he had not time to attend, as his whole soul\\r\\nwas intent upon accumulating for them a fortune.  For several years he\\r\\nsuffered his children to run wild in the village; but suddenly, on his\\r\\nbeing appointed to a considerable agency, he began to think of making his\\r\\nchildren a little genteel.  He sent his son to learn Latin; he hired a\\r\\nmaid to wait upon his daughter Barbara; and he strictly forbade her\\r\\nthenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children, who had\\r\\nhitherto been her playfellows.  They were not sorry for this prohibition,\\r\\nbecause she had been their tyrant rather than their companion.  She was\\r\\nvexed to observe that her absence was not regretted, and she was\\r\\nmortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of\\r\\nairs and finery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one poor girl, amongst her former associates, to whom she had a\\r\\npeculiar dislike,--Susan Price, a sweet tempered, modest, sprightly,\\r\\nindustrious lass, who was the pride and delight of the village.  Her\\r\\nfather rented a small farm, and, unfortunately for him, he lived near\\r\\nAttorney Case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara used often to sit at her window, watching Susan at work.\\r\\nSometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds, or weeding the\\r\\nborders; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for\\r\\nher bees; sometimes she was in the poultry yard, scattering corn from her\\r\\nsieve amongst the eager chickens; and in the evening she was often seated\\r\\nin a little honeysuckle arbour, with a clean, light, three-legged deal\\r\\ntable before her, upon which she put her plain work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother, who was very\\r\\nfond of her, and to whom she was most gratefully attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Price was an intelligent, active, domestic woman; but her health was\\r\\nnot robust.  She earned money, however, by taking in plain work; and she\\r\\nwas famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes.  She was\\r\\nrespected in the village, for her conduct as a wife and as a mother, and\\r\\nall were eager to show her attention.  At her door the first branch of\\r\\nhawthorn was always placed on May morning, and her Susan was usually\\r\\nQueen of the May.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now time to choose the Queen.  The setting sun shone full upon the\\r\\npink blossoms of the hawthorn, when the merry group assembled upon their\\r\\nlittle green.  Barbara was now walking in sullen state in her father\\'s\\r\\ngarden.  She heard the busy voices in the lane, and she concealed herself\\r\\nbehind the high hedge, that she might listen to their conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s Susan?\" were the first unwelcome words which she overheard.\\r\\n\"Ay, where\\'s Susan?\" repeated Philip, stopping short in the middle of a\\r\\nnew tune that he was playing on his pipe.  \"I wish Susan would come!  I\\r\\nwant her to sing me this same tune over again; I have not it yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish Susan would come, I\\'m sure,\" cried a little girl, whose lap\\r\\nwas full of primroses.  \"Susan will give me some thread to tie up my\\r\\nnosegays, and she\\'ll show me where the fresh violets grow; and she has\\r\\npromised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to-\\r\\nmorrow.  I wish she would come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing can be done without Susan!  She always shows us where the nicest\\r\\nflowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows,\" said they.  \"She must\\r\\nmake up the garlands; and she shall be Queen of the May!\" exclaimed a\\r\\nmultitude of little voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does not come!\" said Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose, who was her particular friend, now came forward to assure the\\r\\nimpatient assembly, \"that she would answer for it Susan would come as\\r\\nsoon as she possibly could, and that she probably was detained by\\r\\nbusiness at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs,\\r\\nand Rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell her to make haste,\" cried Philip.  \"Attorney Case dined at the\\r\\nAbbey to-day--luckily for us.  If he comes home and finds us here, maybe\\r\\nhe\\'ll drive us away; for he says this bit of ground belongs to his\\r\\ngarden:  though that is not true, I\\'m sure; for Farmer Price knows, and\\r\\nsays, it was always open to the road.  The Attorney wants to get our\\r\\nplayground, so he does.  I wish he and his daughter Bab, or Miss Barbara,\\r\\nas she must now be called, were a hundred miles off, out of our way, I\\r\\nknow.  No later than yesterday she threw down my nine-pins in one of her\\r\\nill-humours, as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the\\r\\ndust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried Mary, the little primrose-girl, \"her gown is always\\r\\ntrailing.  She does not hold it up nicely, like Susan; and with all her\\r\\nfine clothes she never looks half so neat.  Mamma says she wishes I may\\r\\nbe like Susan, when I grow up to be a great girl, and so do I.  I should\\r\\nnot like to look conceited as Barbara does, if I was ever so rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rich or poor,\" said Philip, \"it does not become a girl to look\\r\\nconceited, much less BOLD, as Barbara did the other day, when she was at\\r\\nher father\\'s door without a hat upon her head, staring at the strange\\r\\ngentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink.  I know what he\\r\\nthought of Bab by his looks, and of Susan, too; for Susan was in her\\r\\ngarden, bending down a branch of the laburnum-tree, looking at its yellow\\r\\nflowers, which were just come out; and when the gentleman asked her how\\r\\nmany miles it was from Shrewsbury, she answered him so modest!--not\\r\\nbashful, like as if she had never seen nobody before--but just right; and\\r\\nthen she pulled on her straw hat, which was fallen back with her looking\\r\\nup at the laburnum, and she went her ways home; and the gentleman says to\\r\\nme, after she was gone, \\'Pray, who is that neat, modest girl--?\\'  But I\\r\\nwish Susan would come,\" cried Philip, interrupting himself,\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was all this time, as her friend Rose rightly guessed, busy at\\r\\nhome.  She was detained by her father\\'s returning later than usual.  His\\r\\nsupper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home; and Susan\\r\\nswept up the ashes twice, and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze\\r\\nfor him; but at last, when he did come in, he took no notice of the blaze\\r\\nor of Susan; and when his wife asked him how he did, he made no answer,\\r\\nbut stood with his back to the fire, looking very gloomy.  Susan put his\\r\\nsupper upon the table, and set his own chair for him; but he pushed away\\r\\nthe chair and turned from the table, saying--\"I shall eat nothing, child!\\r\\nWhy have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said yesterday, father, I thought, that you liked a little cheerful\\r\\nwood fire in the evening; and there was a great shower of hail; your coat\\r\\nis quite wet, we must dry it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take it, then, child,\" said he, pulling it off--\"I shall soon have no\\r\\ncoat to dry--and take my hat, too,\" said he, throwing it upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan hung up his hat, put his coat over the back of a chair to dry, and\\r\\nthen stood anxiously looking at her mother, who was not well; she had\\r\\nthis day fatigued herself with baking; and now, alarmed by her husband\\'s\\r\\nmoody behaviour, she sat down pale and trembling.  He threw himself into\\r\\na chair, folded his arms, and fixed his eyes upon the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was the first who ventured to break silence.  Happy the father who\\r\\nhas such a daughter as Susan!--her unaltered sweetness of temper, and her\\r\\nplayful, affectionate caresses, at last somewhat dissipated her father\\'s\\r\\nmelancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been\\r\\nprepared for him; however, with a faint smile, he told Susan that he\\r\\nthought he could eat one of her guinea-hen\\'s eggs.  She thanked him, and\\r\\nwith that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please, she ran to\\r\\nher neat chicken-yard; but, alas!, her guinea-hen was not there--it had\\r\\nstrayed into the attorney\\'s garden.  She saw it through the paling, and\\r\\ntimidly opening the little gate, she asked Miss Barbara, who was walking\\r\\nslowly by, to let her come in and take her guinea-hen.  Barbara, who was\\r\\nat this instant reflecting, with no agreeable feelings, upon the\\r\\nconversation of the village children, to which she had recently listened,\\r\\nstarted when she heard Susan\\'s voice, and with a proud, ill-humoured look\\r\\nand voice, refused her request.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shut the gate,\" said Barbara, \"you have no business in our garden; and\\r\\nas for your hen, I shall keep it; it is always flying in here, and\\r\\nplaguing us, and my father says it is a trespasser; and he told me I\\r\\nmight catch it and keep it the next time it got in, and it is in now.\"\\r\\nThen Barbara called to her maid, Betty, and bid her catch the mischievous\\r\\nhen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my guinea-hen! my pretty guinea-hen!\" cried Susan, as they hunted\\r\\nthe frightened, screaming creature from corner to corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here we have got it!\" said Betty, holding it fast by the legs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now pay damages, Queen Susan, or good-bye to your pretty guinea-hen,\"\\r\\nsaid Barbara, in an insulting tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damages! what damages?\" said Susan; \"tell me what I must pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A shilling,\" said Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if sixpence would do!\" said Susan; \"I have but sixpence of my own in\\r\\nthe world, and here it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t do,\" said Barbara, turning her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but hear me,\" cried Susan; \"let me at least come in to look for its\\r\\neggs.  I only want ONE for my father\\'s supper; you shall have all the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s your father, or his supper to us? is he so nice that he can eat\\r\\nnone but guinea-hen\\'s eggs?\" said Barbara.  \"If you want your hen and\\r\\nyour eggs, pay for them, and you\\'ll have them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have but sixpence, and you say that won\\'t do,\" said Susan with a sigh,\\r\\nas she looked at her favourite, which was in the maid\\'s grasping hands,\\r\\nstruggling and screaming in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan retired disconsolate.  At the door of her father\\'s cottage she saw\\r\\nher friend Rose, who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all at the hawthorn, and I am come for you.  We can do nothing\\r\\nwithout YOU, dear Susan,\" cried Rose, running to meet her, at the moment\\r\\nshe saw her.  \"You are chosen Queen of the May--come, make haste.  But\\r\\nwhat is the matter? why do you look so sad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Susan, \"don\\'t wait for me; I can\\'t come to you, but,\" added\\r\\nshe, pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden, \"gather those\\r\\nfor poor little Mary; I promised them to her, and tell her the violets\\r\\nare under a hedge just opposite the turnstile, on the right as we go to\\r\\nchurch.  Good-bye! never mind me; I can\\'t come--I can\\'t stay, for my\\r\\nfather wants me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t turn away your face; I won\\'t keep you a moment; only tell me\\r\\nwhat\\'s the matter,\" said her friend, following her into the cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing, not much,\" said Susan; \"only that I wanted the egg in a\\r\\ngreat hurry for father, it would not have vexed me--to be sure I should\\r\\nhave clipped my guinea-hen\\'s wings, and then she could not have flown\\r\\nover the hedge; but let us think no more about it, now,\" added she,\\r\\ntwinkling away a tear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rose, however, learnt that her friend\\'s guinea-hen was detained\\r\\nprisoner by the attorney\\'s daughter, she exclaimed, with all the honest\\r\\nwarmth of indignation, and instantly ran back to tell the story to her\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Barbara! ay; like father, like daughter,\" cried Farmer Price, starting\\r\\nfrom the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed, and drawing his\\r\\nchair closer to his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see something is amiss with me, wife--I\\'ll tell you what it is.\"  As\\r\\nhe lowered his voice, Susan, who was not sure that he wished she should\\r\\nhear what he was going to say, retired from behind his chair.  \"Susan,\\r\\ndon\\'t go; sit you down here, my sweet Susan,\" said he, making room for\\r\\nher upon his chair; \"I believe I was a little cross when I came in first\\r\\ntonight; but I had something to vex me, as you shall hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a fortnight ago, you know, wife,\" continued he, \"there was a\\r\\nballoting in our town for the militia; now at that time I wanted but ten\\r\\ndays of forty years of age; and the attorney told me I was a fool for not\\r\\ncalling myself plump forty.  But the truth is the truth, and it is what I\\r\\nthink fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it.  So I was\\r\\ndrawn for a militiaman; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to\\r\\npart, I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or\\r\\nnine guineas for a substitute--only I had not the nine guineas--for, you\\r\\nknow, we had bad luck with our sheep this year, and they died away one\\r\\nafter another--but that was no excuse, so I went to Attorney Case, and,\\r\\nwith a power of difficulty, I got him to lend me the money; for which, to\\r\\nbe sure, I gave him something, and left my lease of our farm with him, as\\r\\nhe insisted upon it, by way of security for the loan.  Attorney Case is\\r\\ntoo many for me.  He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease; and the\\r\\nlease, he tells me, is not worth a farthing, and that he can turn us all\\r\\nout of our farm to-morrow if he pleases; and sure enough he will please,\\r\\nfor I have thwarted him this day, and he swears he\\'ll be revenged of me.\\r\\nIndeed, he has begun with me badly enough already.  I\\'m not come to the\\r\\nworst part of my story yet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Farmer Price made a dead stop; and his wife and Susan looked up in\\r\\nhis face, breathless with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must come out,\" said he, with a short sigh; \"I must leave you in\\r\\nthree days, wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must you?\" said his wife, in a faint, resigned voice.  \"Susan, love,\\r\\nopen the window.\"  Susan ran to open the window, and then returned to\\r\\nsupport her mother\\'s head.  When she came a little to herself she sat up,\\r\\nbegged that her husband would go on, and that nothing might be concealed\\r\\nfrom her.  Her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife\\r\\nhe loved so well; but, firm as he was, and steady to his maxim, that the\\r\\ntruth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times, his voice\\r\\nfaltered, and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to\\r\\nspeak the whole truth at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact was this.  Case met Farmer Price as he was coming home,\\r\\nwhistling, from a new ploughed field.  The attorney had just dined at The\\r\\nAbbey.  The Abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, to whom Mr. Case had been agent.  The baronet died\\r\\nsuddenly, and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother, who was\\r\\nnow just arrived in the country, and to whom Mr. Case was eager to pay\\r\\nhis court, in hopes of obtaining his favour.  Of the agency he flattered\\r\\nhimself that he was pretty secure; and he thought that he might assume\\r\\nthe tone of command towards the tenants, especially towards one who was\\r\\nsome guineas in debt, and in whose lease there was a flaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccosting the farmer in a haughty manner, the attorney began with, \"So,\\r\\nFarmer Price, a word with you, if you please.  Walk on here, man, beside\\r\\nmy horse, and you\\'ll hear me.  You have changed your opinion, I hope,\\r\\nabout that bit of land--that corner at the end of my garden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As how, Mr. Case?\" said the farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As how, man!  Why, you said something about its not belonging to me,\\r\\nwhen you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did,\" said Price, \"and so I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProvoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were\\r\\npronounced, the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would\\r\\nhave his revenge; but, as his passions were habitually attentive to the\\r\\nLETTER of the law, he refrained from any hasty expression, which might,\\r\\nhe was aware, in a court of justice, be hereafter brought against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good friend, Mr. Price,\" said he, in a soft voice, and pale with\\r\\nsuppressed rage.  He forced a smile.  \"I\\'m under the necessity of calling\\r\\nin the money I lent you some time ago, and you will please to take\\r\\nnotice, that it must be paid to-morrow morning.  I wish you a good\\r\\nevening.  You have the money ready for me, I daresay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the farmer, \"not a guinea of it; but John Simpson, who was my\\r\\nsubstitute, has not left our village yet.  I\\'ll get the money back from\\r\\nhim, and go myself, if so be it must be so, into the militia--so I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney did not expect such a determination, and he represented, in\\r\\na friendly, hypocritical tone to Price, that he had no wish to drive him\\r\\nto such an extremity; that it would be the height of folly in him TO RUN\\r\\nHIS HEAD AGAINST A WALL FOR NO PURPOSE.  \"You don\\'t mean to take the\\r\\ncorner into your own garden, do you, Price?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" said the farmer, \"God forbid! it\\'s none of mine, I never take what\\r\\ndoes not belong to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, right, very proper, of course,\" said Mr. Case; \"but then you have\\r\\nno interest in life in the land in question?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why so stiff about it, Price?  All I want of you to say--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To say that black is white, which I won\\'t do, Mr. Case.  The ground is a\\r\\nthing not worth talking of; but it\\'s neither yours nor mine.  In my\\r\\nmemory, since the NEW lane was made, it has always been open to the\\r\\nparish; and no man shall inclose it with my good-will.  Truth is truth,\\r\\nand must be spoken; justice is justice, and should be done, Mr.\\r\\nAttorney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And law is law, Mr. Farmer, and shall have its course, to your cost,\"\\r\\ncried the attorney, exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village\\r\\nHampden.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they parted.  The glow of enthusiasm, the pride of virtue, which\\r\\nmade our hero brave, could not render him insensible.  As he drew nearer\\r\\nhome, many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart.  He passed the\\r\\ndoor of his own cottage with resolute steps, however, and went through\\r\\nthe village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute.\\r\\nHe found him, told him how the matter stood; and luckily the man, who had\\r\\nnot yet spent the money, was willing to return it; as there were many\\r\\nothers drawn for the militia, who, he observed, would be glad to give him\\r\\nthe same price, or more, for his services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment Price got the money, he hastened to Mr. Case\\'s house, walked\\r\\nstraight forward into his room, and laying the money down upon his desk,\\r\\n\"There, Mr. Attorney, are your nine guineas; count them; now I have done\\r\\nwith you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" said the attorney, jingling the money triumphantly in his\\r\\nhand.  \"We\\'ll give you a taste of the law, my good sir, or I\\'m mistaken.\\r\\nYou forgot the flaw in your lease, which I have safe in this desk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, my lease,\" said the farmer, who had almost forgot to ask for it till\\r\\nhe was thus put in mind of it by the attorney\\'s imprudent threat.  \"Give\\r\\nme my lease, Mr. Case.  I\\'ve paid my money; you have no right to keep the\\r\\nlease any longer, whether it is a bad one or a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me,\" said the attorney, locking his desk, and putting the key\\r\\ninto his pocket, \"possession, my honest friend,\" cried he, striking his\\r\\nhand upon the desk, \"is nine points of the law.  Good night to you.  I\\r\\ncannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which I know there is\\r\\na capital flaw.  It is my duty to show it to my employer; or, in other\\r\\nwords, to your new landlord, whose agent I have good reasons to expect I\\r\\nshall be; you will live to repent your obstinacy, Mr. Price.  Your\\r\\nservant, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice retired with melancholy feelings, but not intimidated.  Many a man\\r\\nreturns home with a gloomy countenance, who has not quite so much cause\\r\\nfor vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Susan heard her father\\'s story, she quite forgot her guinea-hen, and\\r\\nher whole soul was intent upon her poor mother, who, notwithstanding her\\r\\nutmost exertion, could not support herself under this sudden stroke of\\r\\nmisfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the night Susan was called up; her mother\\'s fever ran\\r\\nhigh for some hours; but towards morning it abated, and she fell into a\\r\\nsoft sleep with Susan\\'s hand locked fast in hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan sat motionless, and breathed softly, lest she should disturb her.\\r\\nThe rushlight, which stood beside the bed, was now burnt low; the long\\r\\nshadow of the tall wicker chair flitted, faded, appeared, and vanished,\\r\\nas the flame rose and sunk in the socket.  Susan was afraid that the\\r\\ndisagreeable smell might waken her mother; and, gently disengaging her\\r\\nhand, she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle.  All was silent:  the\\r\\ngrey light of the morning was now spreading over every object; the sun\\r\\nrose slowly, and Susan stood at the lattice window, looking through the\\r\\nsmall leaded, cross-barred panes at the splendid spectacle.  A few birds\\r\\nbegan to chirp; but, as Susan was listening to them, her mother started\\r\\nin her sleep, and spoke unintelligibly.  Susan hung up a white apron\\r\\nbefore the window to keep out the light, and just then she heard the\\r\\nsound of music at a distance in the village.  As it approached nearer,\\r\\nshe knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor.  She\\r\\ndistinguished the merry voices of her companions \"carolling in honour of\\r\\nthe May,\" and soon she saw them coming towards her father\\'s cottage, with\\r\\nbranches and garlands in their hands.  She opened quick, but gently, the\\r\\nlatch of the door, and ran out to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here she is!--here\\'s Susan!\" they exclaimed, joyfully.  \"Here\\'s the\\r\\nQueen of the May.\"  \"And here\\'s her crown!\" cried Rose, pressing forward;\\r\\nbut Susan put her finger upon her lips, and pointed to her mother\\'s\\r\\nwindow.  Philip\\'s pipe stopped instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, \"my mother is ill; I can\\'t leave her, you know.\"\\r\\nThen gently putting aside the crown, her companions bid her say who\\r\\nshould wear it for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you, dear Rose?\" said she, placing the garland upon her friend\\'s\\r\\nhead.  \"It\\'s a charming May morning,\" added she, with a smile; \"good-bye.\\r\\nWe sha\\'n\\'t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner\\r\\ninto the village; so you need only stop till then, Philip.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall stop for all day,\" said Philip:  \"I\\'ve no mind to play any\\r\\nmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, poor Susan.  It is a pity you can\\'t come with us,\" said all\\r\\nthe children; and little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I forgot to thank you,\" said she, \"for the double cowslips; look how\\r\\npretty they are, and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom, and\\r\\nkiss me quick, for I shall be left behind.\"  Susan kissed the little\\r\\nbreathless girl, and returned softly to the side of her mother\\'s bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How grateful that child is to me, for a cowslip only!  How can I be\\r\\ngrateful enough to such a mother as this?\" said Susan to herself, as she\\r\\nbent over her sleeping mother\\'s pale countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother\\'s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed, and Susan\\r\\nsat down in her wicker arm-chair, and went on with the row, in the middle\\r\\nof which her hand stopped the preceding evening.  \"She taught me to knit,\\r\\nshe taught me everything that I know,\" thought Susan, \"and the best of\\r\\nall, she taught me to love her, to wish to be like her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother, when she awakened, felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep,\\r\\nand observing that it was a delightful morning, said, \"that she had been\\r\\ndreaming she heard music; but that the drum frightened her, because she\\r\\nthought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole\\r\\nregiment of soldiers, who had pointed their bayonets at him.  But that\\r\\nwas but a dream, Susan; I awoke, and knew it was a dream, and I then fell\\r\\nasleep, and have slept soundly ever since.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune.  Gradually\\r\\nas this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts, she recalled the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding evening.  She was too certain that she had\\r\\nheard from her husband\\'s own lips the words, \"I MUST LEAVE YOU IN THREE\\r\\nDAYS\"; and she wished that she could sleep again, and think it all a\\r\\ndream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'ll want, he\\'ll want a hundred things,\" said she, starting up.  \"I\\r\\nmust get his linen ready for him.  I\\'m afraid it\\'s very late.  Susan, why\\r\\ndid you let me lie so long?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything shall be ready, dear mother; only don\\'t hurry yourself,\" said\\r\\nSusan.  And indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry, or to do\\r\\nany work this day.  Susan\\'s affectionate, dexterous, sensible activity\\r\\nwas never more wanted, or more effectual.  She understood so readily, she\\r\\nobeyed so exactly; and when she was left to her own discretion, judged so\\r\\nprudently, that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing\\r\\nher.  She said that Susan never did too little, or too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was mending her father\\'s linen, when Rose tapped softly at the\\r\\nwindow, and beckoned to her to come out.  She went out.  \"How does your\\r\\nmother do, in the first place?\" said Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s well, and I have a little bit of good news for you besides--\\r\\nhere,\" said she, pulling out a glove, in which there was money, \"we\\'ll\\r\\nget the guinea-hen back again--we have all agreed about it.  This is the\\r\\nmoney that has been given to us in the village this May morning.  At\\r\\nevery door they gave silver.  See how generous they have been--twelve\\r\\nshillings, I assure you.  Now we are a match for Miss Barbara.  You won\\'t\\r\\nlike to leave home; I\\'ll go to Barbara, and you shall see your guinea-hen\\r\\nin ten minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose hurried away, pleased with her commission, and to accomplish her\\r\\nbusiness.  Miss Barbara\\'s maid Betty was the first person that was\\r\\nvisible at the attorney\\'s house.  Rose insisted upon seeing Miss Barbara\\r\\nherself, and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady, who was\\r\\nreading a dirty novel, which she put under a heap of law papers as they\\r\\nentered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, how you STARTLED me!  Is it only you?\" said she to her maid; but\\r\\nas soon as she saw Rose behind the maid, she put on a scornful air.\\r\\n\"Could not ye say I was not at home, Betty?  Well, my good girl, what\\r\\nbrings you here?  Something to borrow or beg, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMay every ambassador--every ambassador in as good a cause--answer with as\\r\\nmuch dignity and moderation as Rose replied to Barbara upon the present\\r\\noccasion.  She assured her, that the person from whom she came did not\\r\\nsend her either to beg or borrow; that she was able to pay the full value\\r\\nof that for which she came to ask; and, producing her well filled purse,\\r\\n\"I believe that this is a very good shilling,\" said she.  \"If you don\\'t\\r\\nlike it, I will change it, and now you will be so good as to give me\\r\\nSusan\\'s guinea-hen.  It is in her name I ask for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter in whose name you ask for it,\" replied Barbara, \"you will not\\r\\nhave it.  Take up your shilling, if you please.  I would have taken a\\r\\nshilling yesterday, if it had been paid at the time properly; but I told\\r\\nSusan, that if it was not paid then, I should keep the hen, and so I\\r\\nshall, I promise her.  You may go back, and tell her so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney\\'s daughter had, whilst Rose opened her negotiation, measured\\r\\nthe depth of her purse with a keen eye; and her penetration discovered\\r\\nthat it contained at least ten shillings.  With proper management she had\\r\\nsome hopes that the guinea-hen might be made to bring in at least half\\r\\nthe money.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose, who was of a warm temper, not quite so fit a match as she had\\r\\nthought herself for the wily Barbara, incautiously exclaimed, \"Whatever\\r\\nit costs us, we are determined to have Susan\\'s favourite hen; so, if one\\r\\nshilling won\\'t do, take two; and if two won\\'t do, why, take three.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shillings sounded provoking upon the table, as she threw them down\\r\\none after another, and Barbara coolly replied, \"Three won\\'t do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you no conscience, Miss Barbara?  Then take four.\"  Barbara shook\\r\\nher head.  A fifth shilling was instantly proffered; but Bab, who now saw\\r\\nplainly that she had the game in her own hands, preserved a cold, cruel\\r\\nsilence.  Rose went on rapidly, bidding shilling after shilling, till she\\r\\nhad completely emptied her purse.  The twelve shillings were spread upon\\r\\nthe table.  Barbara\\'s avarice was moved, she consented for this ransom to\\r\\nliberate her prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose pushed the money towards her; but just then, recollecting that she\\r\\nwas acting for others more than for herself, and doubting whether she had\\r\\nfull powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain, she gathered up the\\r\\npublic treasure, and with newly-recovered prudence observed that she must\\r\\ngo back to consult her friends.  Her generous little friends were amazed\\r\\nat Barbara\\'s meanness, but with one accord declared that they were most\\r\\nwilling, for their parts, to give up every farthing of the money.  They\\r\\nall went to Susan in a body, and told her so.  \"There\\'s our purse,\" said\\r\\nthey;  \"do what you please with it.\"  They would not wait for one word of\\r\\nthanks, but ran away, leaving only Rose with her to settle the treaty for\\r\\nthe guinea-hen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain manner of accepting a favour, which shows true\\r\\ngenerosity of mind.  Many know how to give, but few know how to accept a\\r\\ngift properly.  Susan was touched, but not astonished, by the kindness of\\r\\nher young friends, and she received the purse with as much simplicity as\\r\\nshe would have given it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Rose, \"shall I go back for the guinea-hen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The guinea-hen!\" said Susan, starting from a reverie into which she had\\r\\nfallen, as she contemplated the purse.  \"Certainly I DO long to see my\\r\\npretty guinea-hen once more; but I was not thinking of her just then--I\\r\\nwas thinking of my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Susan had heard her mother often, in the course of this day, wish\\r\\nthat she had but money enough in the world to pay John Simpson for going\\r\\nto serve in the militia instead of her husband.  \"This, to be sure, will\\r\\ngo but a little way,\" thought Susan; \"but still it may be of some use to\\r\\nmy father.\"  She told her mind to Rose, and concluded by saying,\\r\\ndecidedly, that \"if the money was given to her to dispose of as she\\r\\npleased, she would give it to her father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all yours, my dear, good Susan,\" cried Rose, with a look of warm\\r\\napprobation.  \"This is so like you--but I\\'m sorry that Miss Bab must keep\\r\\nyour guinea-hen.  I would not be her for all the guinea-hens, or guineas\\r\\neither, in the whole world.  Why, I\\'ll answer for it, the guinea-hen\\r\\nwon\\'t make her happy, and you\\'ll be happy EVEN without; because you are\\r\\ngood.  Let me come and help you to-morrow,\" continued she, looking at\\r\\nSusan\\'s work, \"if you have any more mending work to do--I never liked\\r\\nwork till I worked with you.  I won\\'t forget my thimble or my scissors,\"\\r\\nadded she, laughing--\"though I used to forget them when I was a giddy\\r\\ngirl.  I assure you I am a great hand at my needle, now--try me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle,\\r\\nand that she would most willingly accept of her services, but that\\r\\nUNLUCKILY she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But do you know,\" said she, \"I shall have a great deal of business to-\\r\\nmorrow; but I won\\'t tell you what it is that I have to do, for I am\\r\\nafraid I shall not succeed; but if I do succeed, I\\'ll come and tell you\\r\\ndirectly, because you will be so glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan, who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her, and\\r\\nwho had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the\\r\\nfamily at the Abbey, had now formed the courageous, but not presumptuous\\r\\nidea, that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread.  One of\\r\\nthe servants from the Abbey had been sent all round the village in the\\r\\nmorning in search of bread, and had not been able to procure any that was\\r\\ntolerable.  Mrs. Price\\'s last baking failed for want of good barm.  She\\r\\nwas not now strong enough to attempt another herself; and when the\\r\\nbrewer\\'s boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh\\r\\nyeast, she thanked him, but sighed, and said it would be of no use to\\r\\nher.  Accordingly she went to work with much prudent care, and when her\\r\\nbread the next morning came out of the oven, it was excellent; at least\\r\\nher mother said so, and she was a good judge.  It was sent to the Abbey;\\r\\nand as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival\\r\\nin the country, they also were earnest and warm in its praise.  Inquiries\\r\\nwere made from the housekeeper, and they heard, with some surprise, that\\r\\nthis excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper, who had known Susan from a child, was pleased to have an\\r\\nopportunity in speaking in her favour.  \"She is the most industrious\\r\\nlittle creature, ma\\'am, in the world,\" said she to her mistress.  \"Little\\r\\nI can\\'t so well call her now, since she\\'s grown tall and slender to look\\r\\nat; and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at; for handsome is that\\r\\nhandsome does; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself;\\r\\nyet she has as proper a respect for herself, ma\\'am, as you have; and I\\r\\nalways see her neat, and with her mother, ma\\'am, or fit people, as a girl\\r\\nshould be.  As for her mother, she dotes upon her, as well she may; for I\\r\\nshould myself if I had half such a daughter; and then she has two little\\r\\nbrothers; and she\\'s as good to them, and, my boy Philip says, taught \\'em\\r\\nto read more than the school-mistress, all with tenderness and good\\r\\nnature; but, I beg your pardon, ma\\'am, I cannot stop myself when I once\\r\\nbegin to talk of Susan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have really said enough to excite my curiosity,\" said her mistress;\\r\\n\"pray send for her immediately; we can see her before we go out to walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy Philip for Susan, who never\\r\\nhappened to be in such an UNTIDY state as to be unable to obey a summons\\r\\nwithout a long preparation.  She had, it is true, been very busy; but\\r\\norderly people can be busy and neat at the same time.  She put on her\\r\\nusual straw hat, and accompanied Rose\\'s mother, who was going with a\\r\\nbasket of cleared muslin to the Abbey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modest simplicity of Susan\\'s appearance and the artless propriety of\\r\\nthe answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her, pleased\\r\\nthe ladies at the Abbey, who were good judges of character and manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur Somers had two sisters, sensible, benevolent women.  They were\\r\\nnot of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to\\r\\nTHE COUNTRY; nor yet were they of that bustling sort, who quack and\\r\\ndirect all their poor neighbours, for the mere love of managing, or the\\r\\nwant of something to do.  They were judiciously generous; and whilst they\\r\\nwished to diffuse happiness, they were not peremptory in requiring that\\r\\npeople should be happy precisely their own way.  With these dispositions,\\r\\nand with a well informed brother, who, though he never wished to direct,\\r\\nwas always willing to assist in their efforts to do good, there were\\r\\nreasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor\\r\\nvillagers amongst whom they were now settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Miss Somers had spoken to Susan, she inquired for her brother;\\r\\nbut Sir Arthur was in his study, and a gentleman was with him on\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was desirous of returning to her mother, and the ladies therefore\\r\\nwould not detain her.  Miss Somers told her, with a smile, when she took\\r\\nleave, that she would call upon her in the evening at six o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible that such a grand event as Susan\\'s visit to the Abbey\\r\\ncould long remain unknown to Barbara Case and her gossiping maid.  They\\r\\nwatched eagerly for the moment of her return, that they might satisfy\\r\\ntheir curiosity.  \"There she is, I declare, just come into her garden,\"\\r\\ncried Bab; \"I\\'ll run in and get it all out of her in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBab could descend, without shame, whenever it suited her purposes, from\\r\\nthe height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning\\r\\nfamiliarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother\\'s\\r\\nbroth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Susan,\" said Bab, who came close up to her before she perceived it,\\r\\n\"how goes the world with you to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is rather better to-day, she says, ma\\'am--thank you,\" replies\\r\\nSusan, coldly but civilly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MA\\'AM! dear, how polite we are grown of a sudden!\" cried Bab, winking at\\r\\nher maid.  \"One may see you\\'ve been in good company this morning--hey,\\r\\nSusan?  Come, let\\'s hear about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see the ladies themselves, or was it only the housekeeper sent\\r\\nfor you?\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What room did you go into?\" continued Bab.  \"Did you see Miss Somers, or\\r\\nSir Arthur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Somers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! she saw Miss Somers!  Betty, I must hear about it.  Can\\'t you stop\\r\\ngathering those things for a minute, and chat a bit with us, Susan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t stay, indeed, Miss Barbara; for my mother\\'s broth is just\\r\\nwanted, and I\\'m in a hurry.\"  Susan ran home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord, her head is full of broth now,\" said Bab to her maid; \"and she has\\r\\nnot a word for herself, though she has been abroad.  My papa may well\\r\\ncall her Simple Susan; for simple she is, and simple she will be, all the\\r\\nworld over.  For my part, I think she\\'s little better than a downright\\r\\nsimpleton.  But, however, simple or not, I\\'ll get what I want out of her.\\r\\nShe\\'ll be able to speak, maybe, when she has settled the grand matter of\\r\\nthe broth.  I\\'ll step in and ask to see her mother, that will put her in\\r\\na good humour in a trice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara followed Susan into the cottage, and found her occupied with the\\r\\ngrand affair of the broth.  \"Is it ready?\" said Bab, peeping into the pot\\r\\nthat was over the fire.  \"Dear, how savoury it smells!  I\\'ll wait till\\r\\nyou go in with it to your mother; for I must ask her how she does\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you please to sit down then, miss,\" said Simple Susan, with a\\r\\nsmile; for at this instant she forgot the guinea-hen; \"I have but just\\r\\nput the parsley into the broth; but it soon will be ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this interval Bab employed herself, much to her own satisfaction,\\r\\nin cross-questioning Susan.  She was rather provoked indeed that she\\r\\ncould not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed, and what\\r\\nthere was to be for dinner at the Abbey; and she was curious beyond\\r\\nmeasure to find out what Miss Somers meant, by saying that she would call\\r\\nat Mr. Price\\'s cottage at six o\\'clock in the evening.  \"What do you think\\r\\nshe could mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought she meant what she said,\" replied Susan, \"that she would come\\r\\nhere at six o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, that\\'s as plain as a pike-staff,\" said Barbara; \"but what else did\\r\\nshe mean, think you?  People, you know, don\\'t always mean exactly,\\r\\ndownright, neither more nor less than what they say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not always,\" said Susan, with an arch smile, which convinced Barbara\\r\\nthat she was not quite a simpleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"NOT ALWAYS,\" repeated Barbara colouring,--\"oh, then I suppose you have\\r\\nsome guess at what Miss Somers meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Susan, \"I was not thinking about Miss Somers, when I said not\\r\\nalways.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nice that broth does look,\" resumed Barbara, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had now poured the broth into a basin, and as she strewed over it\\r\\nthe bright orange marigolds, it looked very tempting.  She tasted it, and\\r\\nadded now a little salt, and now a little more, till she thought it was\\r\\njust to her mother\\'s taste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! _I_ must taste it,\" said Bab, taking the basin up greedily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you take a spoon?\" said Susan, trembling at the large mouthfuls\\r\\nwhich Barbara sucked up with a terrible noise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take a spoonful, indeed!\" exclaimed Barbara, setting down the basin in\\r\\nhigh anger.  \"The next time I taste your broth you shall affront me, if\\r\\nyou dare!  The next time I set my foot in this house, you shall be as\\r\\nsaucy to me as you please.\"  And she flounced out of the house, repeating\\r\\n\"TAKE A SPOON, PIG, was what you meant to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech; but the\\r\\nconcluding words explained to her the mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years before this time, when Susan was a very little girl, and could\\r\\nscarcely speak plain, as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her\\r\\nsupper at the cottage door, a great pig came up, and put his nose into\\r\\nthe basin.  Susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the\\r\\nbread and milk; but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth,\\r\\nshe presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share;\\r\\nand in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him, \"Take a POON,\\r\\npig.\"*  The saying become proverbial in the village.  Susan\\'s little\\r\\ncompanions repeated it, and applied it upon many occasions, whenever\\r\\nanyone claimed more than his share of anything good.  Barbara, who was\\r\\nthen not Miss Barbara, but plain Bab, and who had played with all the\\r\\npoor children in the neighbourhood, was often reproved in her unjust\\r\\nmethods of division by Susan\\'s proverb.  Susan, as she grew up, forgot\\r\\nthe childish saying; but the remembrance of it rankled in Barbara\\'s mind,\\r\\nand it was to this that she suspected Susan had alluded, when she\\r\\nrecommended a spoon to her, whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth.\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is a true anecdote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La, miss,\" said Barbara\\'s maid, when she found her mistress in a passion\\r\\nupon her return from Susan\\'s, \"I only wondered you did her the honour to\\r\\nset your foot within her doors.  What need have you to trouble her for\\r\\nnews about the Abbey folks, when your own papa has been there all the\\r\\nmorning, and is just come in, and can tell you everything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey that\\r\\nmorning, for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own family about\\r\\nhis morning rides.  He never chose to be asked where he was going, or\\r\\nwhere he had been; and this made his servants more than commonly\\r\\ninquisitive to trace him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara, against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not\\r\\nsufficiently on his guard, had often the art of drawing him into\\r\\nconversation about his visits.  She ran into her father\\'s parlour; but\\r\\nshe knew, the moment she saw his face, that it was no time to ask\\r\\nquestions; his pen was across his mouth, and his brown wig pushed oblique\\r\\nupon his contracted forehead.  The wig was always pushed crooked whenever\\r\\nhe was in a brown or rather, a black study.  Barbara, who did not, like\\r\\nSusan, bear with her father\\'s testy humour from affection and gentleness\\r\\nof disposition, but who always humoured him from artifice, tried all her\\r\\nskill to fathom his thoughts, and when she found that it would not do,\\r\\nshe went to tell her maid so, and to complain that her father was so\\r\\ncross there was no bearing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood possible; for\\r\\nhe was by no means satisfied with his morning\\'s work at the Abbey.  Sir\\r\\nArthur Somers, the NEW MAN, did not suit him, and he began to be rather\\r\\napprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur.  He had sound reasons\\r\\nfor his doubts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur Somers was an excellent lawyer, and a perfectly honest man.\\r\\nThis seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms; in the course of\\r\\nhis practice the case had not occurred; and he had no precedents ready to\\r\\ndirect his proceedings.  Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence,\\r\\nyet of plain dealing and humanity.  The attorney could not persuade\\r\\nhimself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened\\r\\ncunning, and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece\\r\\nof art, and the next despised as the characteristic of folly.  In short,\\r\\nhe had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave.  He had\\r\\nsettled accounts with him for his late agency, and had talked about\\r\\nsundry matters of business.  He constantly perceived, however, that he\\r\\ncould not impose upon Sir Arthur; but the idea that he could know all the\\r\\nmazes of the law, and yet prefer the straight road, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case, having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great legal\\r\\nabilities, and his high reputation at the bar, he coolly replied, \"I have\\r\\nleft the bar.\"  The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment, that a man\\r\\nwho was actually making 3,OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am come,\" said Sir Arthur, \"to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the\\r\\ncountry which I prefer to all others, and amongst people whose happiness\\r\\nI hope to increase.\"  At this speech the attorney changed his ground,\\r\\nflattering himself that he should find his man averse to business, and\\r\\nignorant of country affairs.  He talked of the value of land, and of new\\r\\nleases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur wished to enlarge his domain, and to make a ride round it.  A\\r\\nmap of it was lying upon the table, and Farmer Price\\'s garden came\\r\\nexactly across the new road for the ride.  Sir Arthur looked\\r\\ndisappointed; and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that\\r\\n\"Price\\'s whole land was at his disposal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At my disposal! how so?\" cried Sir Arthur, eagerly; \"it will not be out\\r\\nof lease, I believe, these ten years.  I\\'ll look into the rent roll\\r\\nagain; perhaps I am mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, my good sir, and you are not mistaken,\" said Mr. Case,\\r\\nwith a shrewd smile.  \"In one sense, the land will not be out of lease\\r\\nthese ten years, and in another it is out of lease at this present time.\\r\\nTo come to the point at once, the lease is, ab origine, null and void.  I\\r\\nhave detected a capital flaw in the body of it.  I pledge my credit upon\\r\\nit, sir, it can\\'t stand a single term in law or equity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney observed, that at these words Sir Arthur\\'s eye was fixed\\r\\nwith a look of earnest attention.  \"Now I have him,\" said the cunning\\r\\ntempter to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither in law nor equity,\" repeated Sir Arthur, with apparent\\r\\nincredulity.  \"Are you sure of that, Mr. Case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure!  As I told you before, sir, I\\'d pledge my whole credit upon the\\r\\nthing--I\\'d stake my existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT\\'S SOMETHING,\" said Sir Arthur, as if he was pondering upon the\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man, who sees a\\r\\nchance at one stroke of winning a rich friend, and of ruining a poor\\r\\nenemy.  He explained, with legal volubility and technical amplification,\\r\\nthe nature of the mistake in Mr. Price\\'s lease.  \"It was, sir,\" said he,\\r\\n\"a lease for the life of Peter Price, Susanna his wife, and to the\\r\\nsurvivor or survivors of them, or for the full time and term of twenty\\r\\nyears, to be computed from the first day of May then next ensuing.  Now,\\r\\nsir, this, you see, is a lease in reversion, which the late Sir Benjamin\\r\\nSomers had not, by his settlement, a right to make.  This is a curious\\r\\nmistake, you see, Sir Arthur; and in filling up those printed leases\\r\\nthere\\'s always a good chance of some flaw.  I find it perpetually; but I\\r\\nnever found a better than this in the whole course of my practice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur stood in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" said the attorney, taking him by the button, \"you have no\\r\\nscruple of stirring in this business?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little,\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then, that can be done away in a moment.  Your name shall not\\r\\nappear in it at all.  You have nothing to do but to make over the lease\\r\\nto me.  I make all safe to you with my bond.  Now, being in possession, I\\r\\ncome forward in my own proper person.  SHALL I PROCEED?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--you have said enough,\" replied Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The case, indeed, lies in a nutshell,\" said the attorney, who had by\\r\\nthis time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm,\\r\\nthat, intent upon his vision of a lawsuit, he totally forgot to observe\\r\\nthe impression his words made upon Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s only one thing we have forgotten all this time,\" said Sir\\r\\nArthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can that be, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That we shall ruin this poor man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCase was thunderstruck at these words, or rather, by the look which\\r\\naccompanied them.  He recollected that he had laid himself open before he\\r\\nwas sure of Sir Arthur\\'s REAL character.  He softened, and said he should\\r\\nhave had certainly more CONSIDERATION in the case of any but a litigious,\\r\\npig-headed fellow, as he knew Price to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he be litigious,\" said Sir Arthur, \"I shall certainly be glad to get\\r\\nhim fairly out of the parish as soon as possible.  When you go home, you\\r\\nwill be so good, sir, as to send me his lease, that I may satisfy myself\\r\\nbefore we stir in this business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney, brightening up, prepared to take leave; but he could not\\r\\npersuade himself to take his departure without making one push at Sir\\r\\nArthur about the agency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trouble you, Sir Arthur, with this lease of Price\\'s,\" said\\r\\nCase; \"I\\'ll leave it with your agent.  Whom shall I apply to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"TO MYSELF, sir, if you please,\" replied Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more\\r\\nastounded than our attorney, when they received from their monarch a\\r\\nsimilar answer.  It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur\\'s which had\\r\\nderanged the temper of Mr. Case, and caused his wig to stand so crooked\\r\\nupon his forehead, and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his\\r\\ninquisitive daughter Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having walked up and down his room, conversing with himself, for\\r\\nsome time, the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to\\r\\nsomebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend his duty in Parliament;\\r\\nthat the agency, even for the winter season, was not a thing to be\\r\\nneglected; and that, if he managed well, he might yet secure it for\\r\\nhimself.  He had often found that small timely presents worked\\r\\nwonderfully upon his own mind, and he judged of others by himself.  The\\r\\ntenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him\\r\\ncontinual petty offerings; and he resolved to try the same course with\\r\\nSir Arthur, whose resolution to be his own agent, he thought, argued a\\r\\nclose, saving, avaricious disposition.  He had heard the housekeeper at\\r\\nthe Abbey inquiring, as he passed through the servants, whether there was\\r\\nany lamb to be gotten?  She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of\\r\\nlamb, and that she wished she could get a quarter for him.  Immediately\\r\\nhe sallied into his kitchen, as soon as the idea struck him, and asked a\\r\\nshepherd, who was waiting there, whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be\\r\\nhad anywhere in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know of one,\" cried Barbara.  \"Susan Price has a pet lamb that\\'s as\\r\\nfat as fat could be.\"  The attorney easily caught at these words, and\\r\\nspeedily devised a scheme for obtaining Susan\\'s lamb for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing\\r\\nwas not an over-match for Simple Susan.  He prowled forth in search of\\r\\nhis prey.  He found Susan packing up her father\\'s little wardrobe; and\\r\\nwhen she looked up as she knelt, he saw that she had been in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is your mother to-day, Susan?\" inquired the attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Worse, sir.  My father goes to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be helped,\" said Susan, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be helped--how do you know that?\" said Case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, DEAR sir!\" cried she, looking up at him, and a sudden ray of hope\\r\\nbeamed in her ingenuous countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if YOU could help it, Susan?\" said he.  Susan clasped her hands in\\r\\nsilence, more expressive than words.  \"You CAN help it, Susan.\"  She\\r\\nstarted up in an ecstasy.  \"What would you give now to have your father\\r\\nat home for a whole week longer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything!--but I have nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you have, a lamb,\" said the hard-hearted attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My poor little lamb!\" said Susan; \"but what can that do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What good can any lamb do?  Is not lamb good to eat?  Why do you look so\\r\\npale, girl?  Are not sheep killed every day, and don\\'t you eat mutton?\\r\\nIs your lamb better than anybody else\\'s, think you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Susan, \"but I love it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More fool you,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It feeds out of hand, it follows me about; I have always taken care of\\r\\nit; my mother gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, say no more about it, then,\" he cynically observed; \"if you love\\r\\nyour lamb better than both your father and your mother, keep it, and good\\r\\nmorning to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay, oh stay!\" cried Susan, catching the skirt of his coat with an\\r\\neager, trembling hand;--\"a whole week, did you say?  My mother may get\\r\\nbetter in that time.  No, I do not love my lamb half so well.\"  The\\r\\nstruggle of her mind ceased, and with a placid countenance and calm\\r\\nvoice, \"take the lamb,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is it?\" said the attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grazing in the meadow, by the river side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be brought up before night-fall for the butcher, remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not forget it,\" said Susan, steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon, however, as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the\\r\\nhouse, Susan sat down, and hid her face in her hands.  She was soon\\r\\naroused by the sound of her mother\\'s feeble voice, who was calling Susan\\r\\nfrom the inner room where she lay.  Susan went in; but did not undraw the\\r\\ncurtain as she stood beside the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you there, love?  Undraw the curtain, that I may see you, and tell\\r\\nme;--I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child.\\r\\nSomething\\'s amiss, Susan,\" said her mother, raising herself as well as\\r\\nshe was able in the bed, to examine her daughter\\'s countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you think it amiss, then, my dear mother,\" said Susan, stooping to\\r\\nkiss her--\"would you think it amiss, if my father was to stay with us a\\r\\nweek longer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Susan! you don\\'t say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed, a whole week;--but how burning hot your hand is still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you sure he will stay?\" inquired her mother.  \"How do you know?  Who\\r\\ntold you so?  Tell me all quick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Attorney Case told me so; he can get him a week\\'s longer leave of\\r\\nabsence, and he has promised he will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless him for it, for ever and ever!\" said the poor woman, joining\\r\\nher hands.  \"May the blessing of heaven be with him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan closed the curtains, and was silent.  She COULD NOT SAY AMEN.  She\\r\\nwas called out of the room at this moment, for a messenger was come from\\r\\nthe Abbey for the bread-bills.  It was she who always made out the bills,\\r\\nfor though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing-master,\\r\\nshe had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat,\\r\\nlegible hand, and she found this very useful.  She was not, to be sure,\\r\\nparticularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant, but\\r\\nbusiness must be done.  She set to work, ruled her lines for the pounds,\\r\\nshillings and pence, made out the bill for the Abbey, and despatched the\\r\\nimpatient messenger.  She then resolved to make out all the bills for the\\r\\nneighbours, who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her\\r\\nbaking.  \"I had better get all my business finished,\" said she to\\r\\nherself, \"before I go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was sooner said than done, for she found that she had a great number\\r\\nof bills to write, and the slate on which she had entered the account was\\r\\nnot immediately to be found; and when it was found the figures were\\r\\nalmost rubbed out.  Barbara had sat down upon it.  Susan pored over the\\r\\nnumber of loaves, and the names of the persons who took them; and she\\r\\nwrote and cast up sums, and corrected and re-corrected them, till her\\r\\nhead grew quite puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was covered with little square bits of paper, on which she had\\r\\nbeen writing bills over and over again, when her father came in with a\\r\\nbill in his hand.  \"How\\'s this, Susan?\" said he.  \"How can ye be so\\r\\ncareless, child?  What is your head running upon?  Here, look at the bill\\r\\nyou were sending up to the Abbey?  I met the messenger, and luckily asked\\r\\nto see how much it was.  Look at it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan looked and blushed; it was written, \"Sir Arthur Somers, to John\\r\\nPrice, debtor, six dozen LAMBS, so much.\"  She altered it, and returned\\r\\nit to her father; but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon\\r\\nthe table.  \"What are all these, child?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them are wrong, and I\\'ve written them out again,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them!  All of them, I think, seem to be wrong, if I can read,\"\\r\\nsaid her father, rather angrily, and he pointed out to her sundry strange\\r\\nmistakes.  Her head, indeed, had been running upon her poor lamb.  She\\r\\ncorrected all the mistakes with so much patience, and bore to be blamed\\r\\nwith so much good humour, that her father at last said, that it was\\r\\nimpossible ever to scold Susan, without being in the wrong at the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all was set right, Price took the bills, and said he would go\\r\\nround to the neighbours, and collect the money himself; for that he\\r\\nshould be very proud to have it to say to them, that it was all earned by\\r\\nhis own little daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week\\'s reprieve\\r\\ntill he should come home to sup, as he had promised to do, in her\\r\\nmother\\'s room.  She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the\\r\\nknapsack, which she had been packing up for his journey.  \"How delighted\\r\\nhe will be when he hears the good news!\" said she, to herself; \"but I\\r\\nknow he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Susan had now settled all her business, she thought she could have\\r\\ntime to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite; but\\r\\njust as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four, and\\r\\nthis was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers\\r\\nhome from a dame-school near the village.  She knew that they would be\\r\\ndisappointed, if she was later than usual, and she did not like to keep\\r\\nthem waiting, because they were very patient, good boys; so she put off\\r\\nthe visit to her lamb, and went immediately for her brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Ev\\'n in the spring and playtime of the year,\\r\\n     That calls th\\' unwonted villager abroad,\\r\\n     With all her little ones, a sportive train,\\r\\n     To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,\\r\\n     And prink their heads with daisies.\\r\\n                                        Cowper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dame-school, which was about a mile from the hamlet, was not a showy\\r\\nedifice; but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village\\r\\nscholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land; it was a\\r\\nlow roofed, long, thatched tenement, sheltered by a few reverend oaks,\\r\\nunder which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe close shaven green, which sloped down from the hatch-door of the\\r\\nschoolroom, was paled round with a rude paling, which, though decayed in\\r\\nsome parts by time, was not in any place broken by violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place bespoke order and peace.  The dame who governed was well\\r\\nobeyed, because she was just and well beloved, and because she was ever\\r\\nglad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had once been under her gentle dominion, and had been deservedly\\r\\nher favourite scholar.  The dame often cited her as the best example to\\r\\nthe succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters.  She had scarcely opened the\\r\\nwicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the\\r\\nlane, when she heard the merry voices of the children, and saw the little\\r\\ntroup issuing from the hatchway, and spreading over the green.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, there\\'s Susan!\" cried her two little brothers, running, leaping, and\\r\\nbounding up to her; and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded\\r\\nround her, to talk of their plays; for Susan was easily interested in all\\r\\nthat made others happy; but she could not make them comprehend, that, if\\r\\nthey all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices were still raised one above another, all eager to establish\\r\\nsome important observation about ninepins, or marbles, or tops, or bows\\r\\nand arrows, when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced.\\r\\nThe music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing,\\r\\nand they looked round to see whence it could come.  Susan pointed to the\\r\\ngreat oak-tree, and they beheld, seated under its shade, an old man\\r\\nplaying upon his harp.  The children all approached--at first timidly,\\r\\nfor the sounds were solemn; but as the harper heard their little\\r\\nfootsteps coming towards him, he changed his hand and played one of his\\r\\nmost lively tunes.  The circle closed, and pressed nearer and nearer to\\r\\nhim; some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other, \"He is\\r\\nblind!\"  \"What a pity!\" and \"He looks very poor,--what a ragged coat he\\r\\nwears!\" said others.  \"He must be very old, for all his hair is white;\\r\\nand he must have travelled a great way, for his shoes are quite worn\\r\\nout,\" observed another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp, for when he\\r\\nonce more began to play, not a word was uttered.  He seemed pleased by\\r\\ntheir simple exclamations of wonder and delight, and, eager to amuse his\\r\\nyoung audience, he played now a gay and now a pathetic air, to suit their\\r\\nseveral humours.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s voice, which was soft and sweet, expressive of gentleness and\\r\\ngood nature, caught his ear the moment she spoke.  He turned his face\\r\\neagerly to the place where she stood; and it was observed, that whenever\\r\\nshe said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am blind,\" said the old man, \"and cannot see your faces; but I know\\r\\nyou all asunder by your voices, and I can guess pretty well at all your\\r\\nhumours and characters by your voices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you so, indeed?\" cried Susan\\'s little brother William, who had\\r\\nstationed himself between the old man\\'s knees.  \"Then you heard MY sister\\r\\nSusan speak just now.  Can you tell us what sort of person she is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I can, I think, without being a conjurer,\" said the old man,\\r\\nlifting the boy up on his knee; \"YOUR sister Susan is good-natured.\"  The\\r\\nboy clapped his hands.  \"And good-tempered.\"  \"RIGHT,\" said little\\r\\nWilliam, with a louder clap of applause.  \"And very fond of the little\\r\\nboy who sits upon my knee.\"  \"O right! right! quite right!\" exclaimed the\\r\\nchild, and \"quite right\" echoed on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how came you to know so much, when you are blind?\" said William,\\r\\nexamining the old man attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush,\" said John, who was a year older than his brother, and very sage,\\r\\n\"you should not put him in mind of his being blind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though I am blind,\" said the harper, \"I can hear, you know, and I heard\\r\\nfrom your sister herself all that I told you of her, that she was good-\\r\\ntempered and good-natured and fond of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s wrong--you did not hear all that from herself, I\\'m sure,\"\\r\\nsaid John, \"for nobody ever hears her praising herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not I hear her tell you,\" said the harper, \"when you first came\\r\\nround me, that she was in a great hurry to go home, but that she would\\r\\nstay a little while, since you wished it so much?  Was not that good-\\r\\nnatured?  And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best, she\\r\\nwas not angry with you, but said, \\'Then play William\\'s first, if you\\r\\nplease,\\'--was not that good-tempered?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted William, \"it\\'s all true; but how did you find out that\\r\\nshe was fond of me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is such a difficult question,\" said the harper, \"that I must take\\r\\ntime to consider.\"  The harper tuned his instrument, as he pondered, or\\r\\nseemed to ponder:  and at this instant, two boys who had been searching\\r\\nfor birds\\' nests in the hedges, and who had heard the sound of the harp,\\r\\ncame blustering up, and pushing their way through the circle, one of them\\r\\nexclaimed, \"What\\'s going on here?  Who are you, my old fellow?  A blind\\r\\nharper!  Well, play us a tune, if you can play ever a good one--play me--\\r\\nlet\\'s see, what shall he play, Bob?\" added he turning to his companion.\\r\\n\"Bumper Squire Jones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man, though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory\\r\\nmanner of the request, played, as he was desired, \"Bumper Squire Jones\";\\r\\nand several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and\\r\\ntyrannical voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little children shrunk back in timid silence, and eyed the brutal boy\\r\\nwith dislike.  This boy was the son of Attorney Case; and as his father\\r\\nhad neglected to correct his temper when he was a child, as he grew up it\\r\\nbecame insufferable.  All who were younger and weaker than himself,\\r\\ndreaded his approach, and detested him as a tyrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old harper was so tired that he could play no more, a lad, who\\r\\nusually carried his harp for him, and who was within call, came up, and\\r\\nheld his master\\'s hat to the company, saying, \"Will you be pleased to\\r\\nremember us?\"  The children readily produced their halfpence, and thought\\r\\ntheir wealth well bestowed upon this poor, good-natured man, who had\\r\\ntaken so much pains to entertain them, better even than upon the\\r\\ngingerbread woman, whose stall they loved to frequent.  The hat was held\\r\\nsome time to the attorney\\'s son before he chose to see it.  At last he\\r\\nput his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling.\\r\\nThere were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat.  \"I\\'ll take these\\r\\nhalfpence,\" said he, \"and here\\'s a shilling for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you, sir,\" said the lad; but as he took the shilling which the\\r\\nyoung gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN\\'S HAND, he saw that it\\r\\nwas not worth one farthing.  \"I am afraid it is not good, sir,\" said the\\r\\nlad, whose business it was to examine the money for his master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, then, you\\'ll get no other,\" said young Case, with an\\r\\ninsulting laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It never will do, sir,\" persisted the lad; \"look at it yourself; the\\r\\nedges are all yellow! you can see the copper through it quite plain.\\r\\nSir, nobody will take it from us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s your affair,\" said the brutal boy, pushing away his hand.  \"You\\r\\nmay pass it, you know, as well as I do, if you look sharp.  You have\\r\\ntaken it from me, and I shan\\'t take it back again, I promise you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA whisper of \"that\\'s very unjust,\" was heard.  The little assembly,\\r\\nthough under evident constraint, could no longer suppress their\\r\\nindignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who says it\\'s unjust?\" cried the tyrant, sternly, looking down upon his\\r\\njudges.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s little brothers had held her gown fast, to prevent her from\\r\\nmoving at the beginning of this contest, and she was now so much\\r\\ninterested to see the end of it, that she stood still, without making any\\r\\nresistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver?\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, here\\'s the butcher\\'s boy,\" said the attorney\\'s son; \"show it to\\r\\nhim.\"  He was a sickly-looking boy, and of a remarkably peaceful\\r\\ndisposition.  Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment\\r\\nagainst him.  However, after some moments\\' hesitation, and after turning\\r\\nthe shilling round several times, he pronounced, \"that, as far as his\\r\\njudgment went, but he did not pretend to be a downright CERTAIN SURE of\\r\\nit, the shilling was not over and above good.\"  Then to Susan, to screen\\r\\nhimself from manifest danger, for the attorney\\'s son looked upon him with\\r\\na vengeful mien, \"But here\\'s Susan here, who understands silver a great\\r\\ndeal better than I do; she takes a power of it for bread, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll leave it to her,\" said the old harper; \"if she says the shilling is\\r\\ngood, keep it, Jack.\"  The shilling was handed to Susan, who, though she\\r\\nhad with becoming modesty forborne all interference, did not hesitate,\\r\\nwhen she was called upon, to speak the truth:  \"I think that this\\r\\nshilling is a bad one,\" said she; and the gentle but firm tone in which\\r\\nshe pronounced the words, for a moment awed and silenced the angry and\\r\\nbrutal boy.  \"There\\'s another, then,\" cried he; \"I have sixpences and\\r\\nshillings too in plenty, thank my stars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now walked away with her two little brothers, and all the other\\r\\nchildren separated to go to their several homes.  The old harper called\\r\\nto Susan, and begged, that, if she was going towards the village, she\\r\\nwould be so kind as to show him the way.  His lad took up his harp, and\\r\\nlittle William took the old man by the hand.  \"I\\'ll lead him, I can lead\\r\\nhim,\" said he; and John ran on before them, to gather king-cups in the\\r\\nmeadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small rivulet, which they had to cross, and as a plank which\\r\\nserved for a bridge over it was rather narrow, Susan was afraid to trust\\r\\nthe old blind man to his little conductor; she therefore went on the\\r\\ntottering plank first herself, and then led the old harper carefully\\r\\nover.  They were now come to a gate, which opened upon the high road to\\r\\nthe village.  \"There is the high road straight before you,\" said Susan to\\r\\nthe lad, who was carrying his master\\'s harp; \"you can\\'t miss it.  Now I\\r\\nmust bid you a good evening; for I\\'m in a great hurry to get home, and\\r\\nmust go the short way across the fields here, which would not be so\\r\\npleasant for you, because of the stiles.  Good-bye.\"  The old harper\\r\\nthanked her, and went along the high road, whilst she and her brothers\\r\\ntripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Somers, I am afraid, will be waiting for us,\" said Susan.  \"You\\r\\nknow she said she would call at six; and by the length of our shadows I\\'m\\r\\nsure it is late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to their own cottage-door, they heard many voices, and\\r\\nthey saw, when they entered, several ladies standing in the kitchen.\\r\\n\"Come in, Susan; we thought you had quite forsaken us,\" said Miss Somers\\r\\nto Susan, who advanced timidly.  \"I fancy you forgot that we promised to\\r\\npay you a visit this evening, but you need not blush so much about the\\r\\nmatter; there is no great harm done; we have only been here about five\\r\\nminutes; and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden, and\\r\\nyour orderly shelves.  Is it you, Susan, who keeps these things in such\\r\\nnice order?\" continued Miss Somers, looking round the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Susan could reply, little William pushed forward, and answered,\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, it is MY sister Susan that keeps everything neat; and she\\r\\nalways comes to school for us, too, which was what caused her to be so\\r\\nlate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because as how,\" continued John, \"she was loth to refuse us the hearing\\r\\na blind man play on the harp.  It was we kept her, and we hopes, ma\\'am,\\r\\nas you ARE--as you SEEM so good, you won\\'t take it amiss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with\\r\\nwhich Susan\\'s little brothers undertook her defence, and they were, from\\r\\nthis slight circumstance, disposed to think yet more favourably of a\\r\\nfamily which seemed so well united.  They took Susan along with them\\r\\nthrough the village.  Many neighbours came to their doors, and far from\\r\\nenvying, they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fancy we shall find what we want here,\" said Miss Somers, stopping\\r\\nbefore a shop, where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened\\r\\nin the window, and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged\\r\\nin tempting order.  She went in, and was rejoiced to see the shelves at\\r\\nthe back of the counter well-furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs, and\\r\\ngay, neat printed linens and calicoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Susan, choose yourself a gown,\" said Miss Somers; \"you set an\\r\\nexample of industry and good conduct, of which we wish to take public\\r\\nnotice, for the benefit of others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper, who was father to Susan\\'s friend Rose, looked much\\r\\nsatisfied by this speech, and as if a compliment had been paid to\\r\\nhimself, bowed low to Miss Somers, and then with alertness, which a\\r\\nLondon linen-draper might have admired, produced piece after piece of his\\r\\nbest goods to his young customer--unrolled, unfolded, held the bright\\r\\nstuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights.  Now stretched his arm\\r\\nto the highest shelves, and brought down in a trice what seemed to be\\r\\nbeyond the reach of any but a giant\\'s arm; now dived into some hidden\\r\\nrecess beneath the counter, and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh\\r\\ntemptations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators.  She\\r\\nwas thinking much of her lamb, and more of her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand, and had bid her pay\\r\\nfor her own gown; but Susan, as she looked at the guinea, thought it was\\r\\na great deal of money to lay out upon herself, and she wished, but did\\r\\nknow like to ask, that she might keep it for a better purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings, and incapable\\r\\nof reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty.\\r\\nMiss Somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She does not like any of these things,\" whispered Miss Somers to her\\r\\nsister.  Her sister observed, that Susan looked as if her thoughts were\\r\\nfar distant from gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you don\\'t fancy any of these,\" said the civil shopkeeper to Susan,\\r\\n\"we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season, soon\\r\\nfrom town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted Susan, with a smile and a blush; \"these are all pretty,\\r\\nand too good for me, but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BUT what, Susan?\" said Miss Somers.  \"Tell us what is passing in your\\r\\nlittle mind.\"  Susan hesitated.  \"Well then, we will not press you, you\\r\\nare scarcely acquainted with us yet; when you are, you will not be\\r\\nafraid, I hope, to speak your mind.  Put this shining yellow counter,\"\\r\\ncontinued she, pointing to the guinea, \"in your pocket, and make what use\\r\\nof it you please.  From what we know, and from what we have heard of you,\\r\\nwe are persuaded that you will make a good use of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, madam,\" said the master of the shop, with a shrewd, good\\r\\nnatured look, \"I could give a pretty good guess myself what will become\\r\\nof that guinea; but I say nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that is right,\" said Miss Somers; \"we leave Susan entirely at\\r\\nliberty; and now we will not detain her any longer.  Good night, Susan,\\r\\nwe shall soon come again to your neat cottage.\"  Susan curtsied, with an\\r\\nexpressive look of gratitude, and with a modest frankness in her\\r\\ncountenance, which seemed to say, \"I would tell you, and welcome, what I\\r\\nwant to do with the guinea; but I am not used to speak before so many\\r\\npeople.  When you come to our cottage again you shall know all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Susan had departed, Miss Somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper,\\r\\nwho was folding up all the things he had opened.  \"You have had a great\\r\\ndeal of trouble with us, sir,\" said she; \"and since Susan will not choose\\r\\na gown for herself, I must.\"  She selected the prettiest; and whilst the\\r\\nman was rolling it in paper, she asked him several questions about Susan\\r\\nand her family, which he was delighted to answer, because he had now all\\r\\nopportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No later back, ma\\'am, than last May morning,\" said he, \"as my daughter\\r\\nRose was telling us, Susan did a turn, in her quiet way, by her mother,\\r\\nthat would not displease you if you were to hear it.  She was to have\\r\\nbeen Queen of the May, which in our little village, amongst the younger\\r\\ntribe, is a thing that is thought of a good deal; but Susan\\'s mother was\\r\\nill, and Susan, after sitting up with her all night, would not leave her\\r\\nin the morning, even when they brought the crown to her.  She put the\\r\\ncrown upon my daughter Rose\\'s head with her own hands; and, to be sure,\\r\\nRose loves her as well as if she was her own sister.  But I don\\'t speak\\r\\nfrom partiality; for I am no relation whatever to the Prices--only a\\r\\nwell-wisher, as everyone, I believe, who knows them is.  I\\'ll send the\\r\\nparcel up to the Abbey, shall I, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please,\" said Miss Somers, \"and, as soon as you receive your new\\r\\nthings from town, let us know.  You will, I hope, find us good customers\\r\\nand well-wishers,\" added she, with a smile; \"for those who wish well to\\r\\ntheir neighbours surely deserve to have well-wishers themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few words may encourage the benevolent passions, and may dispose people\\r\\nto live in peace and happiness; a few words may set them at variance, and\\r\\nmay lead to misery and lawsuits.  Attorney Case and Miss Somers were both\\r\\nequally convinced of this, and their practice was uniformly consistent\\r\\nwith their principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now to return to Susan.  She put the bright guinea carefully into the\\r\\nglove with the twelve shillings, which she had received from her\\r\\ncompanions on May day.  Besides this treasure, she calculated that the\\r\\namount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and\\r\\nthirty shillings; and as her father was now sure of a week\\'s reprieve,\\r\\nshe had great hopes that, by some means or other, it would be possible to\\r\\nmake up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute.  \"If that could\\r\\nbut be done,\" said she to herself, \"how happy would my mother be.  She\\r\\nwould be quite stout again, for she certainly is a great deal better,\\r\\nsince I told her that father would stay a week longer.  Ah! but she would\\r\\nnot have blessed Attorney Case, though, if she had known about my poor\\r\\nDaisy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside, resolved to\\r\\ngo by herself, and take leave of her innocent favourite.  But she did not\\r\\npass by unperceived.  Her little brothers were watching for her return,\\r\\nand, as soon as they saw her, they ran after her, and overtook her as she\\r\\nreached the meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did that good lady want with you?\" cried William; but, looking up\\r\\nin his sister\\'s face, he saw tears in her eyes, and he was silent, and\\r\\nwalked on quietly.  Susan saw her lamb by the water-side.  \"Who are those\\r\\ntwo men?\" said William.  \"What are they going to do with DAISY?\"  The two\\r\\nmen were Attorney Case and the butcher.  The butcher was feeling whether\\r\\nthe lamb was fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow; her little brothers ran up\\r\\nto the butcher, and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the\\r\\nlamb.  The butcher did not answer, but the attorney replied, \"It is not\\r\\nyour sister\\'s lamb any longer; it\\'s mine--mine to all intents and\\r\\npurposes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours!\" cried the children, with terror; \"and will you kill it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the butcher\\'s business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boys now burst into piercing lamentations.  They pushed away\\r\\nthe butcher\\'s hand; they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb;\\r\\nthey kissed its forehead--it bleated.  \"It will not bleat to-morrow!\"\\r\\nsaid William, and he wept bitterly.  The butcher looked aside, and\\r\\nhastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney stood unmoved; he pulled up the head of the lamb, which had\\r\\njust stooped to crop a mouthful of clover.  \"I have no time to waste,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"butcher, you\\'ll account with me.  If it\\'s fat--the sooner the\\r\\nbetter.  I\\'ve no more to say.\"  And he walked off, deaf to the prayers of\\r\\nthe poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the attorney was out of sight, Susan rose from the bank where\\r\\nshe was seated, came up to her lamb, and stooped to gather some of the\\r\\nfresh dewy trefoil, to let it eat out of her hand for the last time.\\r\\nPoor Daisy licked her well known hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, let us go,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll wait as long as you please,\" said the butcher.  Susan thanked him,\\r\\nbut walked away quickly, without looking again at her lamb.  Her little\\r\\nbrothers begged the man to stay a few minutes, for they had gathered a\\r\\nhandful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot, and they were decking the\\r\\npoor animal.  As it followed the boys through the village, the children\\r\\ncollected as they passed, and the butcher\\'s own son was amongst the\\r\\nnumber.  Susan\\'s steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boy\\'s\\r\\nmemory; it had saved him a beating.  He went directly to his father to\\r\\nbeg the life of Susan\\'s lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking about it, boy, myself,\" said the butcher; \"it\\'s a sin to\\r\\nkill a PET LAMB, I\\'m thinking--any way, it\\'s what I\\'m not used to, and\\r\\ndon\\'t fancy doing, and I\\'ll go and say as much to Attorney Case; but he\\'s\\r\\na hard man; there\\'s but one way to deal with him, and that\\'s the way I\\r\\nmust take, though so be I shall be the loser thereby; but we\\'ll say\\r\\nnothing to the boys, for fear it might be the thing would not take; and\\r\\nthen it would be worse again to poor Susan, who is a good girl, and\\r\\nalways was, as well as she may, being of a good breed, and well reared\\r\\nfrom the first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, lads, don\\'t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door,\" continued\\r\\nhe, aloud, to the children; \"turn the lamb in here, John, in the paddock,\\r\\nfor to-night, and go your ways home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd dispersed, but murmured, and the butcher went to the attorney.\\r\\n\"Seeing that all you want is a good, fat, tender lamb, for a present for\\r\\nSir Arthur, as you told me,\" said the butcher, \"I could let you have\\r\\nwhat\\'s as good or better for your purpose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better--if it\\'s better, I\\'m ready to hear reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butcher had choice, tender lamb, he said, fit to eat the next day;\\r\\nand as Mr. Case was impatient to make his offering to Sir Arthur, he\\r\\naccepted the butcher\\'s proposal, though with such seeming reluctance,\\r\\nthat he actually squeezed out of him, before he would complete the\\r\\nbargain, a bribe of a fine sweetbread.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime Susan\\'s brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was\\r\\nput into the paddock for the night; this was all they knew, and even this\\r\\nwas some comfort to her.  Rose, her good friend, was with her, and she\\r\\nhad before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week\\'s reprieve.\\r\\nHer mother was better, and even said she was determined to sit up to\\r\\nsupper in her wicker armchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was getting this ready for supper, when little William, who was\\r\\nstanding at the house door, watching in the dusk for his father\\'s return,\\r\\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"Susan! if here is not our old man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the old harper, \"I have found my way to you.  The neighbours\\r\\nwere kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived; for, though I didn\\'t\\r\\nknow your name, they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all.\"\\r\\nSusan came to the door, and the old man was delighted to hear her speak\\r\\nagain.  \"If it would not be too bold,\" said he, \"I\\'m a stranger in this\\r\\npart of the country, and come from afar off.  My boy has got a bed for\\r\\nhimself here in the village; but I have no place.  Could you be so\\r\\ncharitable as to give an old blind man a night\\'s lodging?\"  Susan said\\r\\nshe would step in and ask her mother; and she soon returned with an\\r\\nanswer, that he was heartily welcome, if he could sleep upon the\\r\\nchildren\\'s bed, which was but small.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage.  He struck his\\r\\nhead against the low roof, as he stepped over the doorsill.  \"Many roofs\\r\\nthat are twice as high are not half so good,\" said he.  Of this he had\\r\\njust had experience at the house of the Attorney Case, while he had\\r\\nasked, but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara, who\\r\\nwas, according to her usual custom, standing staring at the hall door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man\\'s harp was set down in Farmer Price\\'s kitchen, and he\\r\\npromised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed; their\\r\\nmother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father.  He came\\r\\nhome with a sorrowful countenance; but how soon did it brighten, when\\r\\nSusan, with a smile, said to him, \"Father, we\\'ve good news for you! good\\r\\nnews for us all!--You have a whole week longer to stay with us; and\\r\\nperhaps,\" continued she, putting her little purse into his hands,--\\r\\n\"perhaps with what\\'s here, and the bread bills, and what may somehow be\\r\\ngot together before a week\\'s at an end, we may make up the nine guineas\\r\\nfor the substitute, as they call him.  Who knows, dearest mother, but we\\r\\nmay keep him with us for ever!\"  As she spoke, she threw her arms round\\r\\nher father, who pressed her to his bosom without speaking, for his heart\\r\\nwas full.  He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that\\r\\nwhat he heard was true; but the revived smiles of his wife, the noisy joy\\r\\nof his little boys, and the satisfaction that shone in Susan\\'s\\r\\ncountenance, convinced him that he was not in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they sat down to supper, the old harper was made welcome to his share\\r\\nof the cheerful though frugal meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s father, as soon as supper was finished, even before he would let\\r\\nthe harper play a tune for his boys, opened the little purse, which Susan\\r\\nhad given him.  He was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings,\\r\\nand still more, when he came to the bottom of the purse, to see the\\r\\nbright golden guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you come by all this money, Susan?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honestly and handsomely, that I\\'m sure of beforehand,\" said her proud\\r\\nmother; \"but how I can\\'t make out, except by the baking.  Hey, Susan is\\r\\nthis your first baking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no,\" said her father, \"I have her first baking snug here,\\r\\nbesides, in my pocket.  I kept it for a surprise, to do your mother\\'s\\r\\nheart good, Susan.  Here\\'s twenty-nine shillings, and the Abbey bill,\\r\\nwhich is not paid yet, comes to ten more.  What think you of this, wife?\\r\\nHave we not a right to be proud of our Susan?  Why,\" continued he,\\r\\nturning to the harper, \"I ask your pardon for speaking out so free before\\r\\nstrangers in praise of my own, which I know is not mannerly; but the\\r\\ntruth is the fittest thing to be spoken, as I think, at all times;\\r\\ntherefore, here\\'s your good health, Susan; why, by-and-by she\\'ll be worth\\r\\nher weight in gold--in silver at least.  But tell us, child, how came you\\r\\nby all this riches? and how comes it that I don\\'t go to-morrow?  All this\\r\\nhappy news makes me so gay in myself, I\\'m afraid I shall hardly\\r\\nunderstand it rightly.  But speak on, child--first bringing us a bottle\\r\\nof the good mead you made last year from your own honey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea-hen--of the\\r\\ngown and of her poor lamb.  Part of this would seem as if she was\\r\\nvaunting of her own generosity, and part of it she did not like to\\r\\nrecollect.  But her mother pressed to know the whole, and she related it\\r\\nas simply as she could.  When she came to the story of her lamb, her\\r\\nvoice faltered, and everybody present was touched.  The old harper sighed\\r\\nonce, and cleared his throat several times.  He then asked for his harp,\\r\\nand, after tuning it for a considerable time, he recollected--for he had\\r\\noften fits of absence--that he sent for it to play the tune he had\\r\\npromised to the boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis harper came from a great distance, from the mountains of Wales, to\\r\\ncontend with several other competitors for a prize, which had been\\r\\nadvertised by a musical society about a year before this time.  There was\\r\\nto be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury, which was\\r\\nabout five miles from our village.  The prize was ten guineas for the\\r\\nbest performer on the harp, and the prize was now to be decided in a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this intelligence Barbara had long since gained from her maid, who\\r\\noften paid visits to the town of Shrewsbury, and she had long had her\\r\\nimagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music-meeting and\\r\\nball.  Often had she sighed to be there, and often had she revolved in\\r\\nher mind schemes for introducing herself to some GENTEEL neighbours, who\\r\\nmight take her to the ball IN THEIR CARRIAGE.  How rejoiced, how\\r\\ntriumphant was she, when this very evening, just about the time when the\\r\\nbutcher was bargaining with her father about Susan\\'s lamb, a servant from\\r\\nthe Abbey rapped at the door, and left a card for Mr. and Miss Barbara\\r\\nCase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" cried Bab, \"_I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey\\r\\ntomorrow.  Who knows?  I daresay, when they see that I\\'m not a vulgar\\r\\nperson, and all that; and if I go cunningly to work with Miss Somers, as\\r\\nI shall, to be sure, I daresay, she\\'ll take me to the ball with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said the maid; \"it\\'s the least one may expect from a lady\\r\\nwho DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price, and goes about a-shopping for\\r\\nher.  The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage, WHICH\\r\\ncosts nothing, but is just a common civility, to a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then pray, Betty,\" continued Miss Barbara, \"don\\'t forget to-morrow, the\\r\\nfirst thing you do, to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet.  I must\\r\\nhave it to DINE IN, at the Abbey, or the ladies will think nothing of me;\\r\\nand Betty, remember the mantua-maker too.  I must see and coax papa to\\r\\nbuy me a new gown against the ball.  I can see, you know, something of\\r\\nthe fashions to-morrow at the Abbey.  I shall LOOK THE LADIES WELL OVER,\\r\\nI promise you.  And, Betty, I have thought of the most charming present\\r\\nfor Miss Somers, as papa says it\\'s good never to go empty-handed to a\\r\\ngreat house, I\\'ll make Miss Somers, who is fond, as her maid told you, of\\r\\nsuch things--I\\'ll make Miss Somers a present of that guinea-hen of\\r\\nSusan\\'s; it\\'s of no use to me, so do you carry it up early in the morning\\r\\nto the Abbey, with my compliments.  That\\'s the thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate\\r\\neffectually in her favour, Miss Barbara paid her first visit at the\\r\\nAbbey.  She expected to see wonders.  She was dressed in all the finery\\r\\nwhich she had heard from her maid, who had heard from the \\'prentice of a\\r\\nShrewsbury milliner, was THE THING in London; and she was much surprised\\r\\nand disappointed, when she was shown into the room where the Miss\\r\\nSomerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting, to see that they did\\r\\nnot, in any one part of their dress, agree with the picture her\\r\\nimagination had formed of fashionable ladies.  She was embarrassed when\\r\\nshe saw books and work and drawings upon the table, and she began to\\r\\nthink that some affront was meant to her, because the COMPANY did not sit\\r\\nwith their hands before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest\\r\\nher, and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening, of which she was\\r\\nherself fond, Miss Barbara still thought herself undervalued, and soon\\r\\ncontrived to expose her ignorance most completely, by talking of things\\r\\nwhich she did not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who never attempt to appear what they are not--those who do not in\\r\\ntheir manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation\\r\\nin life, never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible, well bred\\r\\npeople of any rank; but affectation is the constant and just object of\\r\\nridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Barbara Case, with her mistaken airs of gentility, aiming to be\\r\\nthought a woman, and a fine lady, whilst she was, in reality, a child and\\r\\na vulgar attorney\\'s daughter, rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous,\\r\\nthat the good natured, yet discerning spectators were painfully divided\\r\\nbetween their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who\\r\\ncould feel nothing for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one the ladies dropped off.  Miss Somers went out of the room for\\r\\na few minutes to alter her dress, as it was the custom of the family,\\r\\nbefore dinner.  She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints,\\r\\nfor Miss Barbara\\'s amusement; but Miss Barbara\\'s thoughts were so intent\\r\\nupon the harpers\\' ball, that she could not be entertained with such\\r\\nTRIFLES.  How unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation!\\r\\nThey can never enjoy the present moment.  Whilst Barbara was contriving\\r\\nmeans of interesting Miss Somers in her favour, she recollected, with\\r\\nsurprise, that not one word had yet been said of her present of the\\r\\nguinea-hen.  Mrs. Betty, in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in\\r\\nthe morning, had forgotten it; but it came just whilst Miss Somers was\\r\\ndressing; and the housekeeper came into her mistress\\' room to announce\\r\\nits arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" said she, \"here\\'s a beautiful guinea-hen just come, with Miss\\r\\nBarbara Case\\'s compliments to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers knew, by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this\\r\\nmessage, that there was something in the business which did not perfectly\\r\\nplease her.  She made no answer, in expectation that the housekeeper, who\\r\\nwas a woman of a very open temper, would explain her cause of\\r\\ndissatisfaction.  In this she was not mistaken.  The housekeeper came\\r\\nclose up to the dressing table, and continued, \"I never like to speak\\r\\ntill I\\'m sure, ma\\'am, and I\\'m not quite sure, to say certain, in this\\r\\ncase, ma\\'am, but still I think it right to tell you, which can\\'t wrong\\r\\nanybody, what came across my mind about this same guinea-hen, ma\\'am; and\\r\\nyou can inquire into it, and do as you please afterwards, ma\\'am.  Some\\r\\ntime ago we had fine guinea-fowls of our own, and I made bold, not\\r\\nthinking, to be sure, that all our own would die away from us, as they\\r\\nhave done, to give a fine couple last Christmas to Susan Price, and very\\r\\nfond and pleased she was at the time, and I\\'m sure would never have\\r\\nparted with the hen with her good-will; but if my eyes don\\'t strangely\\r\\nmistake, this hen, that comes from Miss Barbara, is the selfsame\\r\\nidentical guinea-hen that I gave to Susan.  And how Miss Bab came by it\\r\\nis the thing that puzzles me.  If my boy Philip was at home, maybe, as\\r\\nhe\\'s often at Mrs. Price\\'s (which I don\\'t disapprove), he might know the\\r\\nhistory of the guinea-hen.  I expect him home this night, and if you have\\r\\nno objection, I will sift the affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shortest way, I think,\" said Henrietta, \"would be to ask Miss Case\\r\\nherself about it, which I will do this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please, ma\\'am,\" said the housekeeper, coldly; for she knew that\\r\\nMiss Barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was now served.  Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce, and,\\r\\nas the covers were taken from off the dishes, looked around for lamb; but\\r\\nno lamb appeared.  He had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation\\r\\nto his point.  Sir Arthur was speaking, when they sat down to dinner, of\\r\\na new carving knife, which he lately had had made for his sister.  The\\r\\nattorney immediately went from carving-knives to poultry; thence to\\r\\nbutcher\\'s meat.  Some joints, he observed, were much more difficult to\\r\\ncarve than others.  He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman\\r\\nopposite him, who was the curate of the parish.  \"But, sir,\" said the\\r\\nvulgar attorney, \"I must make bold to differ with you in one point, and\\r\\nI\\'ll appeal to Sir Arthur.  Sir Arthur, pray may I ask, when you carve a\\r\\nforequarter of lamb, do you, when you raise the shoulder, throw in salt,\\r\\nor not?\"  This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur.  The\\r\\nattorney was thanked for his intended present; but mortified and\\r\\nsurprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never\\r\\nto accept of any presents from his neighbours.  \"If we were to accept a\\r\\nlamb from a rich neighbour on my estate,\" said he, \"I am afraid we should\\r\\nmortify many of our poor tenants, who can have little to offer, though,\\r\\nperhaps, they may bear us thorough good-will notwithstanding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ladies left the dining-room, as they were walking up and down\\r\\nthe large hall, Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen\\r\\nfather\\'s method of conversing.  One of the ladies observed, that this\\r\\nhall would be a charming place for music.  Bab brought in harps and\\r\\nharpers, and the harpers\\' ball, in a breath.  \"I know so much about it,--\\r\\nabout the ball I mean,\" said she, \"because a lady in Shrewsbury, a friend\\r\\nof papa\\'s, offered to take me with her; but papa did not like to give her\\r\\nthe trouble of sending so far for me, though she has a coach of her own.\"\\r\\nBarbara fixed her eyes upon Miss Somers as she spoke; but she could not\\r\\nread her countenance as distinctly as she wished, because Miss Somers was\\r\\nat this moment letting down the veil of her hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we walk out before tea?\" said Miss Somers to her companions; \"I\\r\\nhave a pretty guinea-hen to show you.\"  Barbara, secretly drawing\\r\\npropitious omens from the guinea-hen, followed with a confidential step.\\r\\nThe pheasantry was well filled with pheasants, peacocks, etc., and\\r\\nSusan\\'s pretty little guinea-hen appeared well, even in this high\\r\\ncompany.  It was much admired.  Barbara was in glory; but her glory was\\r\\nof short duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as Miss Somers was going to inquire into the guinea-hen\\'s history,\\r\\nPhilip came up, to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore, to turn a\\r\\nnutmeg box for his mother.  He was an ingenious lad, and a good turner\\r\\nfor his age.  Sir Arthur had put by a bit of sycamore, on purpose for\\r\\nhim; and Miss Somers told him where it was to be found.  He thanked her:\\r\\nbut in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of\\r\\nthe guinea-hen, and he involuntarily exclaimed, \"Susan\\'s guinea-hen, I\\r\\ndeclare!\"  \"No, it\\'s not Susan\\'s guinea-hen,\" said Miss Barbara,\\r\\ncolouring furiously; \"it is mine, and I have made a present of it to Miss\\r\\nSomers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sound of Bab\\'s voice, Philip turned--saw her--and indignation,\\r\\nunrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators, flashed in his\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter, Philip?\" said Miss Somers, in a pacifying tone; but\\r\\nPhilip was not inclined to be pacified.  \"Why, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"may I\\r\\nspeak out?\" and, without waiting for permission, he spoke out, and gave a\\r\\nfull, true, and warm account of Rose\\'s embassy, and of Miss Barbara\\'s\\r\\ncruel and avaricious proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara denied, prevaricated, stammered, and at last was overcome with\\r\\nconfusion; for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely\\r\\npity her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers, however, mindful of what was due to her guest, was anxious\\r\\nto dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore.  Bab recovered herself as\\r\\nsoon as he was out of sight; but she further exposed herself by\\r\\nexclaiming, \"I\\'m sure I wish this pitiful guinea-hen had never come into\\r\\nmy possession.  I wish Susan had kept it at home, as she should have\\r\\ndone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a\\r\\nlesson,\" said Miss Somers.  \"Shall we try her?\" continued she.  \"Philip\\r\\nwill, I daresay, take the guinea-hen back to Susan, if we desire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please, ma\\'am,\" said Barbara, sullenly; \"I have nothing more to\\r\\ndo with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the guinea-hen was delivered to Philip, who set off joyfully with his\\r\\nprize, and was soon in sight of Farmer Price\\'s cottage.  He stopped when\\r\\nhe came to the door.  He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for\\r\\nSusan.  He was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring\\r\\nthe guinea-hen.  He ran into the village.  All the children who had given\\r\\nup their little purse on May day were assembled on the play-green.  They\\r\\nwere delighted to see the guinea-hen once more.  Philip took his pipe and\\r\\ntabor, and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed\\r\\ncottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me come with you--let me come with you,\" said the butcher\\'s boy to\\r\\nPhilip.  \"Stop one minute! my father has something to say to you.\"  He\\r\\ndarted into his father\\'s house.  The little procession stopped, and in a\\r\\nfew minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard.  Through a back passage,\\r\\nwhich led into the paddock behind the house, they saw the butcher leading\\r\\na lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Daisy!\" exclaimed Rose--\"It\\'s Daisy!\" repeated all her companions.\\r\\n\"Susan\\'s lamb!  Susan\\'s lamb!\" and there was a universal shout of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, for my part,\" said the good butcher, as soon as he could be\\r\\nheard,--\"for my part, I would not be so cruel as Attorney Case for the\\r\\nwhole world.  These poor brute beasts don\\'t know aforehand what\\'s going\\r\\nto happen to them; and as for dying, it\\'s what we must all do some time\\r\\nor another; but to keep wringing the hearts of the living, that have as\\r\\nmuch sense as one\\'s self, is what I call cruel; and is not this what\\r\\nAttorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family, ever\\r\\nsince he took a spite against them?  But, at anyrate, here\\'s Susan\\'s lamb\\r\\nsafe and sound.  I\\'d have taken it back sooner, but I was off before day\\r\\nto the fair, and am but just come back.  Daisy, however, has been as well\\r\\noff in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obliging shopkeeper, who showed the pretty calicoes to Susan, was now\\r\\nat his door, and when he saw the lamb, and heard that it was Susan\\'s, and\\r\\nlearned its history, he said that he would add his mite; and he gave the\\r\\nchildren some ends of narrow riband, with which Rose decorated her\\r\\nfriend\\'s lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pipe and tabor now once more began to play, and the procession moved\\r\\non in joyful order, after giving the humane butcher three cheers; three\\r\\ncheers which were better deserved than \"loud huzzas\" usually are.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was working in her arbour, with her little deal table before her.\\r\\nWhen she heard the sound of the music, she put down her work and\\r\\nlistened.  She saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer.  They\\r\\nhad closed round Daisy, so that she did not see it; but as they came up\\r\\nto the garden gate she saw that Rose beckoned to her.  Philip played as\\r\\nloud as he could, that she might not hear, till the proper moment, the\\r\\nbleating of the lamb.  Susan opened the garden-wicket, and at this signal\\r\\nthe crowd divided, and the first thing that Susan saw, in the midst of\\r\\nher taller friends, was little smiling Mary, with the guinea-hen in her\\r\\narms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on!  Come on!\" cried Mary, as Susan started with joyful surprise;\\r\\n\"you have more to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the music paused, Susan heard the bleating of a lamb, and\\r\\nscarcely daring to believe her senses, she pressed eagerly forward, and\\r\\nbeheld poor Daisy!--she burst into tears.  \"I did not shed one tear when\\r\\nI parted with you, my dear little Daisy!\" said she.  \"It was for my\\r\\nfather and mother.  I would not have parted with you for anything else in\\r\\nthe whole world.  Thank you, thank you all,\" added she, to her\\r\\ncompanions, who sympathized in her joy, even more than they had\\r\\nsympathized in her sorrow.  \"Now, if my father was not to go away from us\\r\\nnext week, and if my mother was quite stout, I should be the happiest\\r\\nperson in the world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Susan pronounced these words, a voice behind the little listening\\r\\ncrowd cried, in a brutal tone, \"Let us pass, if you please; you have no\\r\\nright to stop up the public road!\"  This was the voice of Attorney Case,\\r\\nwho was returning with his daughter Barbara from his visit to the Abbey.\\r\\nHe saw the lamb, and tried to whistle as he went on.  Barbara also saw\\r\\nthe guinea-hen, and turned her head another way, that she might avoid the\\r\\ncontemptuous, reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to\\r\\ndespise.  Even her new bonnet, in which she had expected to be so much\\r\\nadmired, was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her\\r\\nmortification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad she saw the guinea-hen,\" cried Rose, who now held it in her\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Philip, \"she\\'ll not forget May day in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I neither, I hope,\" said Susan, looking round upon her companions\\r\\nwith a most affectionate smile:  \"I hope, whilst I live, I shall never\\r\\nforget your goodness to me last May day.  Now I\\'ve my pretty guinea-hen\\r\\nsafe once more, I should think of returning your money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! no!\" was the general cry.  \"We don\\'t want the money--keep it,\\r\\nkeep it--you want it for your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Susan, \"I am not too proud to be obliged.  I WILL keep your\\r\\nmoney for my father.  Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted Philip, \"don\\'t let us talk of earning; don\\'t let us\\r\\ntalk to her of money now; she has not had time hardly to look at poor\\r\\nDaisy and her guinea-hen. Come, we must go about our business, and let\\r\\nher have them all to herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd moved away in consequence of Philip\\'s considerate advice:  but\\r\\nit was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden-wicket\\r\\nhimself.  He stayed, first, to inform Susan that it was Rose who tied the\\r\\nribands on Daisy\\'s head.  Then he stayed a little longer to let her into\\r\\nthe history of the guinea-hen, and to tell her who it was that brought\\r\\nthe hen home from the Abbey.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose held the sieve, and Susan was feeding her long lost favourite,\\r\\nwhilst Philip leaned over the wicket, prolonging his narration.  \"Now, my\\r\\npretty guinea-hen,\" said Susan--\"my naughty guinea-hen, that flew away\\r\\nfrom me, you shall never serve me so again.  I must cut your nice wings;\\r\\nbut I won\\'t hurt you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care,\" cried Philip; \"you\\'d better, indeed you\\'d better let me hold\\r\\nher whilst you cut her wings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this operation was successfully performed, which it certainly could\\r\\nnever have been if Philip had not held the hen for Susan, he recollected\\r\\nthat his mother had sent him with a message to Mrs. Price.  This message\\r\\nled to another quarter of an hour\\'s delay; for he had the whole history\\r\\nof the guinea-hen to tell over again to Mrs. Price, and the farmer\\r\\nhimself luckily came in whilst it was going on, so it was but civil to\\r\\nbegin it afresh; and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his Susan so\\r\\nhappy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see\\r\\nDaisy fed himself; and Philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug\\r\\nfull of milk, out of which Farmer Price filled the pan for Daisy?  Happy\\r\\nDaisy! who lapped at his ease, whilst Susan caressed him, and thanked her\\r\\nfond father and her pleased mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Philip,\" said Mrs. Price, \"I\\'ll hold the jug--you\\'ll be late with\\r\\nyour message to your mother; we\\'ll not detain you any longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip departed, and as he went out of the garden-wicket, he looked up,\\r\\nand saw Bab and her maid Betty staring out of the window, as usual.  On\\r\\nthis, he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate\\r\\nfast, lest the guinea-hen might stray out, and fall again into the hands\\r\\nof the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Barbara, in the course of this day, felt considerable mortification,\\r\\nbut no contrition.  She was vexed that her meanness was discovered, but\\r\\nshe felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults.  The ball was\\r\\nstill uppermost in her vain, selfish soul. \"Well,\" said she to her\\r\\nconfidante, Betty, \"you hear how things have turned out; but if Miss\\r\\nSomers won\\'t think of asking me to go out with her, I\\'ve a notion I know\\r\\nwho will.  As papa says, it\\'s a good thing to have two strings to one\\'s\\r\\nbow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, some officers, who were quartered at Shrewsbury, had become\\r\\nacquainted with Mr. Case.  They had gotten into some quarrel with a\\r\\ntradesman of the town, and Attorney Case had promised to bring them\\r\\nthrough the affair, as the man threatened to take the law of them.  Upon\\r\\nthe faith of this promise, and with the vain hope that, by civility, they\\r\\nmight dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs, these officers\\r\\nsometimes invited Mr. Case to the mess; and one of them, who had lately\\r\\nbeen married, prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice\\r\\nof Miss Barbara.  It was with this lady that Miss Barbara now hoped to go\\r\\nto the harpers\\' ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The officers and Mrs. Strathspey, or, more properly, Mrs. Strathspey and\\r\\nthe officers, are to breakfast here, tomorrow, do you know,\" said Bab to\\r\\nBetty.  \"One of them dined at the Abbey, to-day, and told papa that\\r\\nthey\\'d all come.  They are going out on a party, somewhere into the\\r\\ncountry, and breakfast here on their way.  Pray, Betty, don\\'t forget that\\r\\nMrs. Strathspey can\\'t breakfast without honey.  I heard her say so\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, indeed,\" said Betty, \"I\\'m afraid Mrs. Strathspey will be likely to\\r\\ngo without her breakfast here; for not a spoonful of honey have we, let\\r\\nher long for it ever so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, surely,\" said Bab, \"we can contrive to get some honey in the\\r\\nneighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s none to be bought, as I know of,\" said Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there none to be begged or borrowed?\" said Bab, laughing.  \"Do\\r\\nyou forget Susan\\'s beehive?  Step over to her in the morning with MY\\r\\nCOMPLIMENTS, and see what you can do.  Tell her it\\'s for Mrs.\\r\\nStrathspey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Betty went with Miss Barbara\\'s compliments to Susan, to\\r\\nbeg some honey for Mrs. Strathspey, who could not breakfast without it.\\r\\nSusan did not like to part with her honey, because her mother loved it,\\r\\nand she therefore gave Betty but a small quantity.  When Barbara saw how\\r\\nlittle Susan sent, she called her A MISER, and she said she MUST have\\r\\nsome more for Mrs. Strathspey.  \"I\\'ll go myself and speak to her.  Come\\r\\nwith me, Betty,\" said the young lady, who found it at present convenient\\r\\nto forget her having declared, the day that she sucked up the broth, that\\r\\nshe never would honour Susan with another visit.  \"Susan,\" said she,\\r\\naccosting the poor girl, whom she had done everything in her power to\\r\\ninjure, \"I must beg a little more honey from you for Mrs. Strathspey\\'s\\r\\nbreakfast.  You know, on a particular occasion such as this, neighbours\\r\\nmust help one another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure they should,\" added Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan, though she was generous, was not weak; she was willing to give to\\r\\nthose she loved, but not disposed to let anything be taken from her, or\\r\\ncoaxed out of her, by those she had reason to despise.  She civilly\\r\\nanswered, that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara grew angry, and lost all command of herself, when she saw that\\r\\nSusan, without regarding her reproaches, went on looking through the\\r\\nglass pane in the beehive.  \"I\\'ll tell you what, Susan Price,\" said she,\\r\\nin a high tone, \"the honey I WILL have, so you may as well give it to me\\r\\nby fair means.  Yes or no!  Speak!  Will you give it me or not?  Will you\\r\\ngive me that piece of the honey-comb that lies there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That bit of honey-comb is for my mother\\'s breakfast,\" said Susan;  \"I\\r\\ncannot give it you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" said Bab, \"then see if I don\\'t take it!\"  She stretched\\r\\nacross Susan for the honey-comb, which was lying by some rosemary leaves\\r\\nthat Susan had freshly gathered for her mother\\'s tea.  Bab grasped, but\\r\\nat her first effort she only reached the rosemary.  She made a second\\r\\ndart at the honey-comb, and, in her struggle to obtain it, she overset\\r\\nthe beehive.  The bees swarmed about her.  Her maid Betty screamed and\\r\\nran away.  Susan, who was sheltered by a laburnum tree, called to\\r\\nBarbara, upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling, and\\r\\nbegged her to stand still, and not to beat them away.  \"If you stand\\r\\nquietly you won\\'t be stung, perhaps.\"  But instead of standing quietly,\\r\\nBab buffeted and stamped and roared, and the bees stung her terribly.\\r\\nHer arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner.  She was helped home\\r\\nby poor Susan and treacherous Mrs. Betty, who, now the mischief was done,\\r\\nthought only of exculpating herself to her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Miss Barbara,\" said she, \"this was quite wrong of you to go and\\r\\nget yourself into such a scrape.  I shall be turned away for it, you\\'ll\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care whether you are turned away or not,\" said Barbara; \"I never\\r\\nfelt such pain in my life.  Can\\'t you do something for me?  I don\\'t mind\\r\\nthe pain either so much as being such a fright.  Pray, how am I to be fit\\r\\nto be seen at breakfast by Mrs. Strathspey; and I suppose I can\\'t go to\\r\\nthe ball either to-morrow, after all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that you can\\'t expect to do, indeed,\" said Betty, the comforter.\\r\\n\"You need not think of balls; for those lumps and swellings won\\'t go off\\r\\nyour face this week.  That\\'s not what pains me; but I\\'m thinking of what\\r\\nyour papa will say to me when he sees you, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling\\r\\none another, Susan, when she saw that she could be of no further use, was\\r\\npreparing to depart, but at the house-door, she was met by Mr. Case.  Mr.\\r\\nCase had revolved things in his mind; for his second visit at the Abbey\\r\\npleased him as little as his first, owing to a few words which Sir Arthur\\r\\nand Miss Somers dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price.  Mr. Case\\r\\nbegan to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this\\r\\nfamily.  The refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorney\\'s mind; and\\r\\nhe was aware that, if the history of Susan\\'s lamb ever reached the Abbey,\\r\\nhe was undone.  He now thought that the most prudent course he could\\r\\npossibly follow would be to HUSH UP matters with the Prices with all\\r\\nconvenient speed.  Consequently, when he met Susan at his door, he forced\\r\\na gracious smile.  \"How is your mother, Susan?\" said he.  \"Is there\\r\\nanything in our house can be of service to her?\"  On hearing his daughter\\r\\nhe cried out, \"Barbara, Barbara--Bab! come downstairs, child, and speak\\r\\nto Susan Price.\"  But as no Barbara answered, her father stalked upstairs\\r\\ndirectly, opened the door, and stood amazed at the spectacle of her\\r\\nswelled visage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara\\'s mishap her own way.\\r\\nBab contradicted her as fast as she spoke.  The attorney turned the maid\\r\\naway on the spot; and partly with real anger, and partly with feigned\\r\\naffectation of anger, he demanded from his daughter how she dared to\\r\\ntreat Susan Price so ill, \"when,\" as he said, \"she was so neighbourly and\\r\\nobliging as to give you some of her honey?  Couldn\\'t you be content,\\r\\nwithout seizing upon the honey-comb by force?  This is scandalous\\r\\nbehaviour, and what, I assure you, I can\\'t countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now interceded for Barbara; and the attorney, softening his voice,\\r\\nsaid that \"Susan was a great deal too good to her; as you are, indeed,\"\\r\\nadded he, \"to everybody.  I forgive her for your sake.\"  Susan curtsied,\\r\\nin great surprise; but her lamb could not be forgotten, and she left the\\r\\nattorney\\'s house as soon as she could, to make her mother\\'s rosemary tea\\r\\nbreakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case saw that Susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair\\r\\nwords.  His next attempt was to conciliate Farmer Price.  The farmer was\\r\\na blunt, honest man, and his countenance remained inflexibly\\r\\ncontemptuous, when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo stood matters the day of the long expected harpers\\' ball.  Miss\\r\\nBarbara Case, stung by Susan\\'s bees, could not, after all her manoeuvres,\\r\\ngo with Mrs. Strathspey to the ball.  The ballroom was filled early in\\r\\nthe evening.  There was a numerous assembly.  The harpers, who contended\\r\\nfor the prize, were placed under the music-gallery at the lower end of\\r\\nthe room.  Amongst them was our old blind friend, who, as he was not so\\r\\nwell clad as his competitors, seemed to be disdained by many of the\\r\\nspectators.  Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges\\r\\nof the performance.  They were seated in a semicircle, opposite to the\\r\\nharpers.  The Miss Somerses, who were fond of music, were amongst the\\r\\nladies in the semicircle; and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir\\r\\nArthur.  There was now silence.  The first harp sounded, and as each\\r\\nmusician tried his skill, the audience seemed to think that each deserved\\r\\nthe prize.  The old blind man was the last.  He tuned his instrument; and\\r\\nsuch a simple, pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart.  All\\r\\nwere fixed in delighted attention; and when the music ceased, the silence\\r\\nfor some moments continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause.  The judges\\r\\nwere unanimous in their opinions, and it was declared that the old blind\\r\\nharper, who played the last, deserved the prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simple, pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly,\\r\\nwas his own composition.  He was pressed to give the words belonging to\\r\\nthe music; and at last he modestly offered to repeat them, as he could\\r\\nnot see to write.  Miss Somers\\' ready pencil was instantly produced; and\\r\\nthe old harper dictated the words of his ballad, which he called--\\r\\n\"Susan\\'s Lamentation for her Lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers looked at her brother from time to time, as she wrote; and\\r\\nSir Arthur, as soon as the old man had finished, took him aside, and\\r\\nasked him some questions, which brought the whole history of Susan\\'s lamb\\r\\nand of Attorney Case\\'s cruelty to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his\\r\\nballad.  His colour, as Sir Arthur steadily looked at him, varied\\r\\ncontinually; till at length, when he heard the words \"Susan\\'s Lamentation\\r\\nfor her Lamb,\" he suddenly shrunk back, skulked through the crowd, and\\r\\ndisappeared.  We shall not follow him; we had rather follow our old\\r\\nfriend, the victorious harper.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had he received the ten guineas, his well merited prize, than\\r\\nhe retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house, asked\\r\\nfor pen, ink and paper, and dictated, in a low voice, to his boy, who was\\r\\na tolerably good scribe, a letter, which he ordered him to put directly\\r\\ninto the Shrewsbury post-office.  The boy ran with the letter to the\\r\\npost-office.  He was but just in time, for the postman\\'s horn was\\r\\nsounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, when Farmer Price, his wife, and Susan, were sitting\\r\\ntogether, reflecting that his week\\'s leave of absence was nearly at an\\r\\nend, and that the money was not yet made up for John Simpson, the\\r\\nsubstitute, a knock was heard at the door, and the person who usually\\r\\ndelivered the letters in the village put a letter into Susan\\'s hand,\\r\\nsaying, \"A penny, if you please--here\\'s a letter for your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me!\" said Farmer Price; \"here\\'s the penny then, but who can it be\\r\\nfrom, I wonder?  Who can think of writing to me, in this world?\"  He tore\\r\\nopen the letter; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him-\\r\\n-\"your obliged friend, Llewellyn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what\\'s this?\" said he, opening a paper that was inclosed in the\\r\\nletter.  \"It\\'s a song, seemingly; it must be somebody that has a mind to\\r\\nmake an April fool of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not April, it is May, father,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us read the letter, and we shall come to the truth all in good\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Price sat down in his own chair, for he could not read entirely to\\r\\nhis satisfaction in any other, and read as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY WORTHY FRIEND,--I am sure you will be glad to hear that I have had\\r\\ngood success this night.  I have won the ten guinea prize, and for that I\\r\\nam in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter Susan; as you will\\r\\nsee by a little ballad I inclose for her.  Your hospitality to me has\\r\\nafforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history.\\r\\nYou do not, I hope, forget that I was present when you were counting the\\r\\ntreasure in Susan\\'s little purse, and that I heard for what purpose it\\r\\nwas all destined.  You have not, I know, yet made up the full sum for\\r\\nyour substitute, John Simpson; therefore do me the favour to use the five\\r\\nguinea bank note which you will find within the ballad.  You shall not\\r\\nfind me as hard a creditor as Attorney Case.  Pay me the money at your\\r\\nown convenience.  If it is never convenient to you to pay it, I shall\\r\\nnever ask it.  I shall go my rounds again through this country, I\\r\\nbelieve, about this time next year, and will call to see how you do, and\\r\\nto play the new tune for Susan and the dear little boys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should just add, to set your heart at rest about the money, that it\\r\\ndoes not distress me at all to lend it to you.  I am not quite so poor as\\r\\nI appear to be.  But it is my humour to go about as I do.  I see more of\\r\\nthe world under my tattered garb than, perhaps, I should ever see in a\\r\\nbetter dress.  There are many of my profession who are of the same mind\\r\\nas myself in this respect; and we are glad, when it lies in our way, to\\r\\ndo any kindness to such a worthy family as yours.--So, fare ye well.\\r\\n                      \"Your obliged Friend,\\r\\n                                             \"LLEWELLYN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now, by her father\\'s desire, opened the ballad.  He picked up the\\r\\nfive guinea bank note, whilst she read, with surprise, \"Susan\\'s\\r\\nLamentation for her Lamb.\"  Her mother leaned over her shoulder to read\\r\\nthe words; but they were interrupted, before they had finished the first\\r\\nstanza, by another knock at the door.  It was not the postman with\\r\\nanother letter.  It was Sir Arthur and his sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came with an intention, which they were much disappointed to find\\r\\nthat the old harper had rendered vain--they came to lend the farmer and\\r\\nhis good family the money to pay for his substitute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, since we are here,\" said Sir Arthur, \"let me do my own business,\\r\\nwhich I had like to have forgotten.  Mr. Price, will you come out with\\r\\nme, and let me show you a piece of your land, through which I want to\\r\\nmake a road.  Look there,\" said Sir Arthur, pointing to the spot, \"I am\\r\\nlaying out a ride round my estate, and that bit of land of yours stops\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said Price, \"the land\\'s mine, to be sure, for that matter;\\r\\nbut I hope you don\\'t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be\\r\\nstiff about a trifle or so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is,\" said Sir Arthur, \"I had heard you were a litigious, pig-\\r\\nheaded fellow; but you do not seem to deserve this character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hope not, sir,\" said the farmer; \"but about the matter of the land, I\\r\\ndon\\'t want to take any advantage of your wishing for it.  You are welcome\\r\\nto it; and I leave it to you to find me out another bit of land\\r\\nconvenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less; or else to\\r\\nmake up the value to me some way or other.  I need say no more about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hear something,\" continued Sir Arthur, after a short silence--\"I hear\\r\\nsomething, Mr. Price, of a FLAW in your lease.  I would not speak to you\\r\\nabout it whilst we were bargaining about your land, lest I should over-\\r\\nawe you; but, tell me, what is this flaw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In truth, and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times,\"\\r\\nsaid the farmer, \"I didn\\'t know myself what a flaw, as they call it,\\r\\nmeant, till I heard of the word from Attorney Case; and, I take it, a\\r\\nflaw is neither more nor less than a mistake, as one should say.  Now, by\\r\\nreason a man does not make a mistake on purpose, it seems to me to be the\\r\\nfair thing, that if a man finds out his mistake, he might set it right;\\r\\nbut Attorney Case says this is not law; and I\\'ve no more to say.  The man\\r\\nwho drew up my lease made a mistake; and if I must suffer for it, I\\r\\nmust,\" said the farmer.  \"However, I can show you, Sir Arthur, just for\\r\\nmy own satisfaction and yours, a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of\\r\\npaper, which was given me by your relation, the gentleman who lived here\\r\\nbefore, and let me my farm.  You\\'ll see, by that bit of paper, what was\\r\\nmeant; but the attorney says, the paper\\'s not worth a button in a court\\r\\nof justice, and I don\\'t understand these things.  All I understand is the\\r\\ncommon honesty of the matter.  I\\'ve no more to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This attorney, whom you speak of so often,\" said Sir Arthur, \"you seem\\r\\nto have some quarrel with.  Now, would you tell me frankly what is the\\r\\nmatter between--?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The matter between us, then,\" said Price, \"is a little bit of ground,\\r\\nnot worth much, that is there open to the lane at the end of Mr. Case\\'s\\r\\ngarden, sir, and he wanted to take it in.  Now I told him my mind, that\\r\\nit belonged to the parish, and that I never would willingly give my\\r\\nconsent to his cribbing it in that way.  Sir, I was the more loath to see\\r\\nit shut into his garden, which, moreover, is large enough of all\\r\\nconscience without it, because you must know, Sir Arthur, the children in\\r\\nour village are fond of making a little play-green of it; and they have a\\r\\ncustom of meeting on May day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of\\r\\nit, and altogether I was very loath to see \\'em turned out of it by those\\r\\nwho have no right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go and see this nook,\" said Sir Arthur.  \"It is not far off, is\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir, just hard by here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got to the ground, Mr. Case, who saw them walking together, was\\r\\nin a hurry to join them, that he might put a stop to any explanations.\\r\\nExplanations were things of which he had a great dread; but, fortunately,\\r\\nhe was upon this occasion a little too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the nook in dispute?\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; this is the whole thing,\" said Price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Sir Arthur,\" interposed the politic attorney, with an assumed air\\r\\nof generosity, \"don\\'t let us talk any more about it.  Let it belong to\\r\\nwhom it will, I give it up to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So great a lawyer, Mr. Case, as you are,\" replied Sir Arthur, \"must\\r\\nknow, that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title; and\\r\\nin this case it is impossible that, with the best intentions to oblige me\\r\\nin the world, you can give up this bit of land to me, because it is mine\\r\\nalready, as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining\\r\\nland, which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers.  This piece of\\r\\nground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road, and it was\\r\\ncut off when the lane was made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very possibly.  I daresay you are quite correct; you must know best,\"\\r\\nsaid the attorney, trembling for the agency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Sir Arthur, \"Mr. Price, you will observe that I now promise\\r\\nthis little green to the children for a play-ground; and I hope they may\\r\\ngather hawthorn many a May day at this their favourite bush.\"  Mr. Price\\r\\nbowed low, which he seldom did, even when he received a favour himself.\\r\\n\"And now, Mr. Case,\" said Sir Arthur, turning to the attorney, who did\\r\\nnot know which way to look, \"you sent me a lease to look over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye-ye-yes,\" stammered Mr Case.  \"I thought it my duty to do so; not out\\r\\nof any malice or ill-will to this good man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have done him no injury,\" said Sir Arthur, coolly.  \"I am ready to\\r\\nmake him a new lease, whenever he pleases, of his farm, and I shall be\\r\\nguided by a memorandum of the original bargain, which he has in his\\r\\npossession.  I hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid, sir,\" said the attorney, sanctifying his face, \"that I\\r\\nshould suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man, rich or poor;\\r\\nbut to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really think so?\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly I do, and I hope I have not hazarded your good opinion by\\r\\nspeaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly.  I always understood\\r\\nthat there could be nothing ungentlemanlike, in the way of business, in\\r\\ntaking advantage of a flaw in a lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Sir Arthur, \"you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in\\r\\nyour own case.  You intended to send me this poor man\\'s lease; but your\\r\\nson, by some mistake, brought me your own, and I have discovered a fatal\\r\\nerror in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fatal error!\" said the alarmed attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sir Arthur, pulling the lease out of his pocket.  \"Here\\r\\nit is.  You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the\\r\\ngrantor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, you won\\'t take advantage of me, surely, Sir Arthur?\" said Mr. Case,\\r\\nforgetting his own principles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not take advantage of you, as you would have taken of this\\r\\nhonest man.  In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in\\r\\nmy possession.  I shall not, Mr. Case, defraud you of one shilling of\\r\\nyour property.  I am ready, at a fair valuation, to pay the exact value\\r\\nof your house and land; but upon this condition--that you quit the parish\\r\\nwithin one month!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAttorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the\\r\\ncase, for he knew that he could not legally resist.  Indeed he was glad\\r\\nto be let off so easily; and he bowed and sneaked away, secretly\\r\\ncomforting himself with the hope, that when they came to the valuation of\\r\\nthe house and land he should be the gainer, perhaps of a few guineas.\\r\\nHis reputation he justly held very cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a scholar; you write a good hand; you can keep accounts, cannot\\r\\nyou?\" said Sir Arthur to Mr. Price, as they walked home towards the\\r\\ncottage.  \"I think I saw a bill of your little daughter\\'s drawing out the\\r\\nother day, which was very neatly written.  Did you teach her to write?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Price, \"I can\\'t say I did THAT; for she mostly taught it\\r\\nherself, but I taught her a little arithmetic, as far as I knew, on our\\r\\nwinter nights, when I had nothing better to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your daughter shows that she has been well taught,\" said Sir Arthur;\\r\\n\"and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her\\r\\nparents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good, very good indeed, sir, to speak in this sort of way,\"\\r\\nsaid the delighted father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS,\" said Sir Arthur.  \"You\\r\\nare attached to your own family, perhaps you may become attached to me,\\r\\nwhen you come to know me, and we shall have frequent opportunities of\\r\\njudging of one another.  I want no agent to squeeze my tenants, or do my\\r\\ndirty work.  I only want a steady, intelligent, honest man, like you, to\\r\\ncollect my rents, and I hope, Mr. Price, you will have no objection to\\r\\nthe employment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, sir,\" said Price, with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest\\r\\ncountenance, \"that you\\'ll never have cause to repent your goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what are my sisters about here?\" said Sir Arthur, entering the\\r\\ncottage, and going behind his sisters, who were busily engaged in\\r\\nmeasuring an extremely pretty coloured calico.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is for Susan, my dear brother,\" said they.  \"I know she did not keep\\r\\nthat guinea for herself,\" said Miss Somers.  \"I have just prevailed upon\\r\\nher mother to tell me what became of it.  Susan gave it to her father;\\r\\nbut she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time; and I am sure\\r\\nshe will not, because her mother, I see, likes it.  And, Susan, I hear\\r\\nthat instead of becoming Queen of the May this year, you were sitting in\\r\\nyour sick mother\\'s room.  Your mother has a little colour in her cheeks\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" interrupted Mrs. Price, \"I\\'m quite well.  Joy, I think, has\\r\\nmade me quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Miss Somers, \"I hope you will be able to come out on your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s birthday, which, I hear, is the 25th of this month.  Make\\r\\nhaste and get quite well before that day; for my brother intends that all\\r\\nthe lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on Susan\\'s\\r\\nbirthday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir Arthur, \"and I hope on that day, Susan, you will be very\\r\\nhappy with your little friends upon their play-green.  I shall tell them\\r\\nthat it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them; and if you\\r\\nhave anything to ask, any little favour for any of your companions, which\\r\\nwe can grant, now ask, Susan.  These ladies look as if they would not\\r\\nrefuse you anything that is reasonable; and, I think, you look as if you\\r\\nwould not ask anything unreasonable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Susan, after consulting her mother\\'s eyes, \"there is, to be\\r\\nsure, a favour I should like to ask; it is for Rose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know who Rose is,\" said Sir Arthur, smiling; \"but, go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am, you have seen her, I believe; she is a very good girl, indeed,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Price.  \"And works very neatly, indeed,\" continued Susan,\\r\\neagerly, to Miss Somers; \"and she and her mother heard you were looking\\r\\nout for someone to wait upon you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say no more,\" said Miss Somers; \"your wish is granted.  Tell Rose to\\r\\ncome to the Abbey, to-morrow morning, or, rather, come with her yourself;\\r\\nfor our housekeeper, I know, wants to talk to you about a certain cake.\\r\\nShe wishes, Susan, that you should be the maker of the cake for the\\r\\ndance; and she has good things ready looked out for it already, I know.\\r\\nIt must be large enough for everybody to have a slice, and the\\r\\nhousekeeper will ice it for you.  I only hope your cake will be as good\\r\\nas your bread.  Fare ye well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family, silent with\\r\\ngratitude, who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do I wish, now,\" said Farmer Price, \"and it\\'s almost a sin for one\\r\\nthat has had such a power of favours done him, to wish for anything more;\\r\\nbut how I DO wish, wife, that our good friend, the harper was only here\\r\\nat this time.  It would do his old, warm heart good.  Well, the best of\\r\\nit is, we shall be able next year, when he comes his rounds, to pay him\\r\\nhis money with thanks, being all the time, and for ever, as much obliged\\r\\nto him as if we kept it.  I long, so I do, to see him in this house\\r\\nagain, drinking, as he did, just in this spot, a glass of Susan\\'s mead,\\r\\nto her very good health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, \"and the next time he comes, I can give him one of my\\r\\nguinea-hen\\'s eggs, and I shall show my lamb, Daisy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, love,\" said her mother, \"and he will play that tune and sing that\\r\\npretty ballad.  Where is it? for I have not finished it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rose ran away with it, mother, but I\\'ll step after her, and bring it\\r\\nback to you this minute,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn, in the midst of a crowded\\r\\ncircle of her companions, to whom she was reading \"Susan\\'s Lamentation\\r\\nfor her Lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The words are something, but the tune--the tune--I must have the tune,\"\\r\\ncried Philip.  \"I\\'ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out\\r\\nwhich way that good old man went after the ball; and if he\\'s above\\r\\nground, we\\'ll have him back by Susan\\'s birthday, and he shall sit here--\\r\\njust exactly here by this, our bush, and he shall play--I mean, if he\\r\\npleases--that same tune for us, and I shall learn it--I mean, if I can--\\r\\nin a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents,\\r\\nand that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a month, soon spread\\r\\nover the village.  Many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing the joyful tidings confirmed by Susan herself.  The crowd on the\\r\\nplay-green increased every minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried the triumphant Philip, \"I tell you it\\'s all true, every word\\r\\nof it.  Susan\\'s too modest to say it herself; but I tell ye all, Sir\\r\\nArthur gave us this play-green for ever, on account of her being so\\r\\ngood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, at last Attorney Case, with all his cunning has not proved a\\r\\nmatch for \"Simple Susan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE PIGEON.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little town of Somerville, in Ireland, has, within these few years,\\r\\nassumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an English village.  Mr.\\r\\nSomerville, to whom this town belongs, wished to inspire his tenantry\\r\\nwith a taste for order and domestic happiness, and took every means in\\r\\nhis power to encourage industrious, well behaved people to settle in his\\r\\nneighbourhood.  When he had finished building a row of good slated houses\\r\\nin his town, he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he\\r\\ncould find, and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the best tenants, Mr. Somerville did not, however, mean the best\\r\\nbidders; and many, who had offered an extravagant price for the houses,\\r\\nwere surprised to find their proposals rejected.  Amongst these was Mr.\\r\\nCox, an alehouse keeper, who did not bear a very good character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please your honour, sir,\" said he to Mr. Somerville, \"I expected, since\\r\\nI bid as fair and fairer for it than any other, that you would have let\\r\\nme the house next the apothecary\\'s.  Was not it fifteen guineas I\\r\\nmentioned in my proposal? and did not your honour give it against me for\\r\\nthirteen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My honour did just so,\" replied Mr. Somerville, calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And please your honour, but I don\\'t know what it is I or mine have done\\r\\nto offend you.  I\\'m sure there is not a gentleman in all Ireland I\\'d go\\r\\nfurther to sarve.  Would not I go to Cork to-morrow for the least word\\r\\nfrom your honour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Cox, but I have no business at Cork at\\r\\npresent,\" answered Mr. Somerville, drily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all I wish,\" exclaimed Mr. Cox, \"that I could find out and light\\r\\nupon the man that has belied me to your honour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No man has belied you, Mr. Cox, but your nose belies you much, if you do\\r\\nnot love drinking a little, and your black eye and cut chin belie you\\r\\nmuch if you do not love quarrelling a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quarrel!  I quarrel, please your honour!  I defy any man, or set of men,\\r\\nten mile round, to prove such a thing, and I am ready to fight him that\\r\\ndares to say the like of me.  I\\'d fight him here in your honour\\'s\\r\\npresence, if he\\'d only come out this minute, and meet me like a man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Cox put himself into a boxing attitude, but observing that Mr.\\r\\nSomerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile, and that\\r\\nseveral people, who had gathered round him as he stood in the street,\\r\\nlaughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition, he changed his\\r\\nattitude, and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of\\r\\ndrinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as to drink, please your honour, there\\'s no truth in it.  Not a drop\\r\\nof whisky, good or bad, have I touched these six months, except what I\\r\\ntook with Jemmy M\\'Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your\\r\\nhonour coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Mr. Somerville made no answer, but turned away to look at\\r\\nthe bow window of a handsome new inn, which the glazier was at this\\r\\ninstant glazing.  \"Please your honour, that new inn is not let, I hear,\\r\\nas yet,\" resumed Mr. Cox; \"if your honour recollects, you promised to\\r\\nmake me a compliment of it last Seraphtide was twelvemonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" cried Mr. Somerville, \"for I had no thoughts of building an\\r\\ninn at that time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I beg your honour\\'s pardon but if you\\'d be just pleased to\\r\\nrecollect, it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows, FORENENT\\r\\nThady O\\'Connor, you made me the promise--I\\'ll leave it to him, so I\\r\\nwill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I will not leave it to him, I assure you,\" cried Mr. Somerville; \"I\\r\\nnever made any such promise.  I never thought of letting this inn to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then your honour won\\'t let me have it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you have told me a dozen falsehoods.  I do not wish to have you for\\r\\na tenant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, God bless your honour; I\\'ve no more to say, but God bless your\\r\\nhonour,\" said Mr. Cox; and he walked away, muttering to himself, as he\\r\\nslouched his hat over his face, \"I hope I\\'ll live to be revenged on him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new\\r\\ninn, which he expected to see perfectly finished; but he was met by the\\r\\ncarpenter, who, with a rueful face, informed him that six panes of glass\\r\\nin the large bow-window had been broken during the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! perhaps Mr. Cox has broken my windows, in revenge for my refusing to\\r\\nlet him my house,\" said Mr. Somerville; and many of the neighbours, who\\r\\nknew the malicious character of this Mr. Cox, observed that this was like\\r\\none of his tricks.  A boy of about twelve years old, however, stepped\\r\\nforward and said, \"I don\\'t like Mr. Cox, I\\'m sure; for once he beat me\\r\\nwhen he was drunk; but, for all that, no one should be accused\\r\\nwrongfully.  He could not be the person that broke these windows last\\r\\nnight, for he was six miles off.  He slept at his cousin\\'s last night,\\r\\nand he has not returned home yet.  So I think he knows nothing of the\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy, and\\r\\nobserving that he looked in eagerly at the staircase, when the house door\\r\\nwas opened, he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new\\r\\nhouse.  \"Yes, sir,\" said the boy, \"I should like to go up those stairs,\\r\\nand to see what I should come to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up with you, then!\" said Mr. Somerville; and the boy ran up the stairs.\\r\\nHe went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and\\r\\ndelight.  At length, as he was examining one of the garrets, he was\\r\\nstartled by a fluttering noise over his head; and looking up, he saw a\\r\\nwhite pigeon, who, frightened at his appearance, began to fly round and\\r\\nround the room, till it found its way out of the door, and flew into the\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carpenter was speaking to Mr. Somerville upon the landing-place of\\r\\nthe stairs; but, the moment he spied the white pigeon, he broke off in\\r\\nthe midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs, and exclaimed, \"There\\r\\nhe is, please your honour!  There\\'s he that has done all the damage to\\r\\nour bow-window--that\\'s the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the\\r\\nchurch windows last Sunday was se\\'nnight; but he\\'s down for it now; we\\r\\nhave him safe, and I\\'ll chop his head off, as he deserves, this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay!  O stay! don\\'t chop his head off:  he does not deserve it,\" cried\\r\\nthe boy, who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness--\\r\\n\"_I_ broke your window, sir,\" said he to Mr. Somerville.  \"I broke your\\r\\nwindow with this ball; but I did not know that I had done it, till this\\r\\nmoment, I assure you, or I should have told you before.  Don\\'t chop his\\r\\nhead off,\" added the boy to the carpenter, who had now the white pigeon\\r\\nin his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"the pigeon\\'s head shall not be chopped off,\\r\\nnor yours either, my good boy, for breaking a window.  I am persuaded by\\r\\nyour open, honest countenance, that you are speaking the truth; but pray\\r\\nexplain this matter to us; for you have not made it quite clear.  How\\r\\nhappened it that you could break my windows without knowing it? and how\\r\\ncame you to find it out at last?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said the boy, \"if you\\'ll come up here, I\\'ll show you all I know,\\r\\nand how I came to know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville followed the boy into the garret, who pointed to a pane of\\r\\nglass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of\\r\\nwaste ground behind the house.  Upon this piece of waste ground the\\r\\nchildren of the village often used to play.  \"We were playing there at\\r\\nball yesterday evening,\" continued the boy, addressing himself to Mr.\\r\\nSomerville, \"and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall,\\r\\nwhich I did; but he said I did not hit it, and bade me give him up my\\r\\nball as the forfeit.  This I would not do; and when he began to wrestle\\r\\nwith me for it, I threw the ball, as I thought, over the house.  He ran\\r\\nto look for it in the street, but could not find it, which I was very\\r\\nglad of; but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this\\r\\nheap of shavings, sir, under this broken window; for, as soon as I saw it\\r\\nlying there, I knew I must have been the person that broke the window;\\r\\nand through this window came the white pigeon.  Here\\'s one of his white\\r\\nfeathers sticking in the gap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the carpenter, \"and in the bow-window room below there\\'s\\r\\nplenty of his feathers to be seen; for I\\'ve just been down to look.  It\\r\\nwas the pigeon broke THEM windows, sure enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he could not have got in had I not broke this little window,\" said\\r\\nthe boy, eagerly; \"and I am able to earn sixpence a day, and I\\'ll pay for\\r\\nall the mischief, and welcome.  The white pigeon belongs to a poor\\r\\nneighbour, a friend of ours, who is very fond of him, and I would not\\r\\nhave him killed for twice as much money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take the pigeon, my honest, generous lad,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"and\\r\\ncarry him back to your neighbour.  I forgive him all the mischief he has\\r\\ndone me, tell your friend, for your sake.  As to the rest, we can have\\r\\nthe windows mended; and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what he never did yet,\" said the carpenter.  \"Many\\'s the sixpence\\r\\nhe earns, but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket:  it goes every\\r\\nfarthing to his poor father and mother.  Happy for them to have such a\\r\\nson!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More happy for him to have such a father and mother,\" exclaimed the boy.\\r\\n\"Their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for\\r\\nlove or money, and would, if I would let them, go on paying for my\\r\\nschooling now, falling as they be in the world; but I must learn to mind\\r\\nthe shop now.  Good morning to you, sir; and thank you kindly,\" said he\\r\\nto Mr. Somerville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And where does this boy live, and who are his father and mother?  They\\r\\ncannot live in town,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"or I should have heard of\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are but just come into the town, please your honour,\" said the\\r\\ncarpenter.  \"They lived formerly upon Counsellor O\\'Donnel\\'s estate; but\\r\\nthey were ruined, please your honour, by taking a joint lease with a man,\\r\\nwho fell afterwards into bad company, ran out all he had, so could not\\r\\npay the landlord; and these poor people were forced to pay his share and\\r\\ntheir own too, which almost ruined them.  They were obliged to give up\\r\\nthe land; and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with\\r\\nwhat goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale\\r\\nof their cattle and stock.  They have the good-will of all who know them;\\r\\nand I am sure I hope they will do well.  The boy is very ready in the\\r\\nshop, though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day.  He writes a\\r\\ngood hand, and is quick at casting up accounts, for his age.  Besides, he\\r\\nis likely to do well in the world, because he is never in idle company,\\r\\nand I\\'ve known him since he was two foot high, and never heard of his\\r\\ntelling a lie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an excellent character of the boy, indeed,\" said Mr. Somerville,\\r\\n\"and from his behaviour this morning I am inclined to think that he\\r\\ndeserves all your praises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor\\r\\nfamily, and to attend to their conduct himself, fully determined to\\r\\nassist them if he should find them such as they had been represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, this boy, whose name was Brian O\\'Neill, went to return\\r\\nthe white pigeon to its owner.  \"You have saved its life,\" said the woman\\r\\nto whom it belonged, \"and I\\'ll make you a present of it.\"  Brian thanked\\r\\nher; and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon.  He always\\r\\ntook care to scatter some oats for it in his father\\'s yard; and the\\r\\npigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen, and eat\\r\\noff the same trencher with the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian, after the shop was shut up at night, used to amuse himself with\\r\\nreading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him\\r\\narithmetic was so good as to lend him.  Amongst these he one evening met\\r\\nwith a little book full of the history of birds and beasts; he looked\\r\\nimmediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds,\\r\\nand, to his great joy, he found a full description and history of his\\r\\nfavourite bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Brian, I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you; you\\r\\nlike your book, I see, when you have no master over you to bid you read,\"\\r\\nsaid his father, when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you for having me taught to read, father,\" said Brian.  \"Here I\\'ve\\r\\nmade a great discovery:  I\\'ve found out in this book, little as it looks,\\r\\nfather, a most curious way of making a fortune; and I hope it will make\\r\\nyour fortune, father; and if you\\'ll sit down, I\\'ll tell it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. O\\'Neill, in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation\\r\\nof having his fortune made, immediately sat down to listen; and his son\\r\\nexplained to him, that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who\\r\\ncarried notes and letters:  \"and, father,\" continued Brian, \"I find my\\r\\npigeon is of this sort; and I intend to make my pigeon carry messages.\\r\\nWhy should not he?  If other pigeons have done so before him, I think he\\r\\nis as good, and, I daresay, will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the\\r\\nworld.  I shall begin to teach him to-morrow morning; and then, father,\\r\\nyou know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers; and no boy\\r\\ncan run, no horse can gallop, so fast as a bird can fly; therefore the\\r\\nbird must be the best messenger, and I should be paid the best price.\\r\\nHey, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, to be sure, my boy,\" said his father, laughing; \"I wish you\\r\\nmay make the best messenger in Ireland of your pigeon; but all I beg, my\\r\\ndear boy, is that you won\\'t neglect our shop for your pigeon; for I\\'ve a\\r\\nnotion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by\\r\\nthe white pigeon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian never neglected the shop; but in his leisure hours he amused\\r\\nhimself with training his pigeon; and after much patience he at last\\r\\nsucceeded so well, that one day he went to his father and offered to send\\r\\nhim word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of\\r\\nBallynagrish, where he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The pigeon will be home long before me, father; and he will come in at\\r\\nthe kitchen window, and light upon the dresser; then you must untie the\\r\\nlittle note which I shall have tied under his left wing, and you\\'ll know\\r\\nthe price of beef directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pigeon carried his message well; and Brian was much delighted with\\r\\nhis success.  He soon was employed by the neighbours, who were aroused by\\r\\nBrian\\'s fondness of his swift messenger; and soon the fame of the white\\r\\npigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of\\r\\nSomerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink,\\r\\nand to concert plans of robberies.  Their place of meeting was at the\\r\\nale-house of Mr. Cox, the man who, as our readers may remember, was\\r\\noffended by Mr. Somerville\\'s hinting that he was fond of drinking and of\\r\\nquarrelling, and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new\\r\\ninn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst these men were talking over their scheme, one of them observed,\\r\\nthat one of their companions was not arrived.  Another said, \"No.\"  \"He\\'s\\r\\nsix miles off,\" said another; and a third wished that he could make him\\r\\nhear at that distance.  This turned the discourse upon the difficulties\\r\\nof sending messages secretly and quickly.  Cox\\'s son, a lad of about\\r\\nnineteen, who was one of this gang, mentioned the white carrier-pigeon,\\r\\nand he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession.\\r\\nAccordingly, the next day young Cox went to Brian O\\'Neill, and tried, at\\r\\nfirst by persuasion and afterwards by threats, to prevail upon him to\\r\\ngive up the pigeon.  Brian was resolute in his refusal, more especially\\r\\nwhen the petitioner began to bully him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we can\\'t have it by fair means, we will by foul,\" said Cox; and a few\\r\\ndays afterwards the pigeon was gone.  Brian searched for it in vain--\\r\\ninquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it, and applied, but to\\r\\nno purpose, to Cox.  He swore that he knew nothing about the matter.  But\\r\\nthis was false, for it was he who during the night-time had stolen the\\r\\nwhite pigeon.  He conveyed it to his employers, and they rejoiced that\\r\\nthey had gotten it into their possession, as they thought it would serve\\r\\nthem for a useful messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more shortsighted than cunning.  The very means which\\r\\nthese people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their\\r\\nplots to light.  They endeavoured to teach the pigeon, which they had\\r\\nstolen, to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some\\r\\ndistance from Somerville; and when they fancied that it had forgotten its\\r\\nformer habits, and its old master, they thought that they might venture\\r\\nto employ him nearer home.  The pigeon, however, had a better memory than\\r\\nthey imagined.  They loosed him from a bag near the town of Ballynagrish\\r\\nin hopes that he would stop at the house of Cox\\'s cousin, which was on\\r\\nits road between Ballynagrish and Somerville.  But the pigeon, though he\\r\\nhad been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial, did\\r\\nnot stop there, but flew on to his old master\\'s house in Somerville, and\\r\\npecked at the kitchen window, as he had formerly been taught to do.  His\\r\\nfather, fortunately, was within hearing, and poor Brian ran with the\\r\\ngreatest joy to open the window and to let him in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, father, here\\'s my white pigeon come back of his own accord,\"\\r\\nexclaimed Brian; \"I must run and show him to my mother.\"  At this instant\\r\\nthe pigeon spread his wings, and Brian discovered under one of its wings\\r\\na small and very dirty looking billet.  He opened it in his father\\'s\\r\\npresence.  The scrawl was scarcely legible; but these words were at\\r\\nlength deciphered:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thare are eight of uz sworn; I send yo at botom thare names.  We meat at\\r\\ntin this nite at my faders, and have harms and all in radiness to brak\\r\\ninto the grate \\'ouse.  Mr. Summervill is to lye out to nite--kip the\\r\\npigeon untill to-morrow.  For ever yours,     MURTAGH COX, JUN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had they finished reading this note, than both father and son\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Let us go and show it to Mr. Somerville.\"  Before they set\\r\\nout, they had, however, the prudence to secure the pigeon, so that he\\r\\nshould not be seen by anyone but themselves.  Mr. Somerville, in\\r\\nconsequence of this fortunate discovery, took proper measures for the\\r\\napprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house.  When they\\r\\nwere all safely lodged in the county gaol, he sent for Brian O\\'Neill and\\r\\nhis father; and after thanking them for the service they had done him, he\\r\\ncounted out ten bright guineas upon a table, and pushed them towards\\r\\nBrian, saying, \"I suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was\\r\\noffered some weeks ago for the discovery of John Mac Dermod, one of the\\r\\neight men whom we have just taken up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Brian; \"I did not know it, and I did not bring that note\\r\\nto you to get ten guineas, but because I thought it was right.  I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to be paid for doing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s my own boy,\" said his father.  \"We thank you, sir; but we\\'ll not\\r\\ntake the money; I DON\\'T LIKE TO TAKE THE PRICE OF BLOOD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know the difference, my good friends,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"between\\r\\nvile informers and courageous, honest men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, as to that, please your honour, though we are poor, I hope we are\\r\\nhonest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, what is more,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"I have a notion that you would\\r\\ncontinue to be honest, even if you were rich.  Will you, my good lad,\"\\r\\ncontinued Mr. Somerville, after a moment\\'s pause--\"will you trust me with\\r\\nyour pigeon a few days?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, and welcome, sir,\" said the boy, with a smile; and he brought the\\r\\npigeon to Mr. Somerville when it was dark, and nobody saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days afterwards, Mr. Somerville called at O\\'Neill\\'s house, and bid\\r\\nhim and his son follow him.  They followed till he stopped opposite to\\r\\nthe bow-window of the new inn.  The carpenter had just put up a sign,\\r\\nwhich was covered over with a bit of carpeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go up the ladder, will you?\" said Mr. Somerville to Brian, \"and pull\\r\\nthat sign straight, for it hangs quite crooked.  There, now it is\\r\\nstraight.  Now pull off the carpet, and let us see the new sign.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy pulled off the cover, and saw a white pigeon painted upon the\\r\\nsign, and the name of O\\'Neill in large letters underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful\\r\\noccasion,\" said Mr. Somerville, who saw that Brian\\'s surprise was too\\r\\ngreat for his situation.  \"Come down from the ladder, and wish your\\r\\nfather joy of being master of the new inn called the \\'White Pigeon.\\'  And\\r\\nI wish him joy of having such a son as you are.  Those who bring up their\\r\\nchildren well, will certainly be rewarded for it, be they poor or rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" said Rosamond, after a long silence, \"do you know what I have\\r\\nbeen thinking of all this time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear.--What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, mamma, about my cousin Bell\\'s birthday; do you know what day it\\r\\nis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear mother! don\\'t you remember it\\'s the 22nd of December; and her\\r\\nbirthday is the day after to-morrow?  Don\\'t you recollect now?  But you\\r\\nnever remember about birthdays, mamma.  That was just what I was thinking\\r\\nof, that you never remember my sister Laura\\'s birthday, or-or-or MINE,\\r\\nmamma.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean my dear?  I remember your birthday perfectly well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! but you never KEEP it, though.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean by keeping your birthday?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mamma, you know very well--as Bell\\'s birthday is kept.  In the first\\r\\nplace, there is a great dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; nor I should not mind about the dinner, except the mince-pies.  But\\r\\nBell has a great many nice things--I don\\'t mean nice eatable things, but\\r\\nnice new playthings, given to her always on her birthday; and everybody\\r\\ndrinks her health, and she\\'s so happy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay, Rosamond, how you jumble things together!  Is it everybody\\'s\\r\\ndrinking her health that makes her so happy? or the new playthings, or\\r\\nthe nice mince pies?  I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she\\r\\nis eating a mince pie, or whilst she is playing; but how does everybody\\'s\\r\\ndrinking her health at dinner make her happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond paused, and then said she did not know.  \"But,\" added she, \"the\\r\\nNICE NEW playthings, mother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why the nice new playthings?  Do you like them only because they are\\r\\nNEW?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not ONLY--_I_ do not like playthings ONLY because they are new; but Bell\\r\\nDOES, I believe--for that puts me in mind--Do you know, mother, she had a\\r\\ngreat drawer full of OLD playthings that she never used, and she said\\r\\nthat they were good for nothing, because they were OLD; but I thought\\r\\nmany of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones.  Now you\\r\\nshall be judge, mamma; I\\'ll tell you all that was in the drawer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Rosamond, thank you, not just now; I have not time to listen to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then, mamma, the day after to-morrow I can show you the drawer.  I\\r\\nwant you to judge very much, because I am sure I was in the right.  And,\\r\\nmother,\" added Rosamond, stopping her as she was going out of the room,\\r\\n\"will you--not now, but when you\\'ve time--will you tell me why you never\\r\\nkeep my birthday--why you never make any difference between that day and\\r\\nany other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you, Rosamond--not now, but when you have time to think about\\r\\nit--tell me why I should make any difference between your birthday and\\r\\nany other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond thought, but she could not find out any reason; besides, she\\r\\nsuddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer; for there\\r\\nwas a certain work-basket to be finished, which she was making for her\\r\\ncousin Bell, as a present upon her birthday.  The work was at a stand for\\r\\nwant of some filigree-paper, and, as her mother was going out, she asked\\r\\nher to take her with her, that she might buy some.  Her sister Laura went\\r\\nwith them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister,\" said Rosamond, as they were walking along, \"what have you done\\r\\nwith your half-guinea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have it in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear! you will keep it for ever in your pocket.  You know, my godmother\\r\\nwhen she gave it to you, said you would keep it longer than I should keep\\r\\nmine; and I know what she thought by her look at the time.  I heard her\\r\\nsay something to my mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Laura, smiling; \"she whispered so loud that I could not help\\r\\nhearing her too.  She said I was a little miser.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But did not you hear her say that I was very GENEROUS? and she\\'ll see\\r\\nthat she was not mistaken.  I hope she\\'ll be by when I give my basket to\\r\\nBell--won\\'t it be beautiful?  There is to be a wreath of myrtle, you\\r\\nknow, round the handle, and a frost ground, and then the medallions--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" interrupted her sister, for Rosamond, anticipating the glories of\\r\\nher work-basket, talked and walked so fast that she had passed, without\\r\\nperceiving it, the shop where the filigree-paper was to be bought.  They\\r\\nturned back.  Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a\\r\\nstreet, and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane.  A coach\\r\\nfull of ladies stopped at the door, just before they went in, so that no\\r\\none had time immediately to think of Rosamond and her filigree-paper, and\\r\\nshe went to the window where she saw her sister Laura looking earnestly\\r\\nat something that was passing in the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposite to the window, at the door of a poor-looking house, there was\\r\\nsitting a little girl weaving lace.  Her bobbins moved as quick as\\r\\nlightning, and she never once looked up from her work.  \"Is not she very\\r\\nindustrious?\" said Laura; \"and very honest, too?\" added she in a minute\\r\\nafterwards; for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head\\r\\npassed, and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl.\\r\\nShe took it up eagerly, looked at it as if she was very hungry, then put\\r\\naside her work, and ran after the baker to return it to him.  Whilst she\\r\\nwas gone, a footman in a livery, laced with silver, who belonged to the\\r\\ncoach that stood at the shop door, as he was lounging with one of his\\r\\ncompanions, chanced to spy the weaving pillow, which she had left upon a\\r\\nstone before the door.  To divert himself (for idle people do mischief\\r\\noften to divert themselves) he took up the pillow, and entangled all the\\r\\nbobbins.  The little girl came back out of breath to her work; but what\\r\\nwas her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled.  She twisted and\\r\\nuntwisted, placed and replaced, the bobbins, while the footman stood\\r\\nlaughing at her distress.  She got up gently, and was retiring into the\\r\\nhouse, when the silver laced footman stopped her, saying, insolently,\\r\\n\"Sit still, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go to my mother, sir,\" said the child; \"besides, you have spoiled\\r\\nall my lace.  I can\\'t stay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" said the brutal footman, snatching her weaving-pillow again,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll teach you to complain of me.\"  And he broke off, one after another,\\r\\nall the bobbins, put them into his pocket, rolled her weaving-pillow down\\r\\nthe dirty lane, then jumped up behind his mistress\\' coach, and was out of\\r\\nsight in an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor girl!\" exclaimed Rosamond, no longer able to restrain her\\r\\nindignation at this injustice; \"poor little girl!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant her mother said to Rosamond--\"Come, now, my dear, if you\\r\\nwant this filigree paper, buy it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Rosamond; and the idea of what her godmother and her\\r\\ncousin Bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her\\r\\nimagination.  All her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed.\\r\\nSatisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the \"Poor little girl!\"\\r\\nshe went to spend her half-guinea upon her filigree basket.  In the\\r\\nmeantime, she that was called the \"little miser\" beckoned to the poor\\r\\ngirl, and, opening the window, said, pointing to the cushion, \"Is it\\r\\nquite spoiled?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite! quite spoiled! and I can\\'t, nor mother neither, buy another; and\\r\\nI can\\'t do anything else for my bread.\"  A few, but very few, tears fell\\r\\nas she said this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much would another cost?\" said Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a great--GREAT deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More than that?\" said Laura, holding up her half-guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you can buy another with that,\" said Laura, dropping the half-\\r\\nguinea into her hand; and she shut the window before the child could find\\r\\nwords to thank her, but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude,\\r\\nwhich gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could\\r\\nhave been bestowed upon her generosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate on the morning of her cousin\\'s birthday, Rosamond finished her work-\\r\\nbasket.  The carriage was at the door--Laura came running to call her;\\r\\nher father\\'s voice was heard at the same instant; so she was obliged to\\r\\ngo down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper--a\\r\\ncircumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted; for the pleasure\\r\\nof surprising Bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree\\r\\nshould peep out before the proper time.  As the carriage went on,\\r\\nRosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other, and by each of\\r\\nthe four corners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will never do, my dear,\" said her father, who had been watching her\\r\\noperations.  \"I am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a\\r\\nbox which is twice as large as itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not a box, father,\" said Rosamond, a little peevishly; \"it\\'s a\\r\\nbasket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us look at this basket,\" said he, taking it out of her unwilling\\r\\nhands, for she knew of what frail materials it was made, and she dreaded\\r\\nits coming to pieces under her father\\'s examination.  He took hold of the\\r\\nhandle rather roughly; when, starting off the coach seat, she cried, \"Oh,\\r\\nsir! father! sir! you will spoil it indeed!\" said she, with increased\\r\\nvehemence, when, after drawing aside the veil of silver paper, she saw\\r\\nhim grasp the myrtle wreathed handle.  \"Indeed, sir, you will spoil the\\r\\npoor handle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is the use of THE POOR HANDLE,\" said her father, \"if we are not\\r\\nto take hold of it?  And pray,\" continued he, turning the basket round\\r\\nwith his finger and thumb, rather in a disrespectful manner, \"pray, is\\r\\nthis the thing you have been about all this week?  I have seen you all\\r\\nthis week dabbling with paste and rags; I could not conceive what you\\r\\nwere about.  Is this the thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.  You think, then, that I have wasted my time, because the\\r\\nbasket is of no use; but then it is a present for my Cousin Bell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is\\r\\nof no use.  You had better have given her the purple jar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, father! I thought you had forgotten that--it was two years ago; I\\'m\\r\\nnot so silly now.  But Bell will like the basket, I know, though it is of\\r\\nno use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two years ago,--well,\\r\\nperhaps that is true; but how comes it, Rosamond, now that you are so\\r\\nwise, that you are fond of such a silly person?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_, father?\" said Rosamond, hesitating, \"I don\\'t think I am VERY fond\\r\\nof her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say VERY fond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but I don\\'t think I am at all fond of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and all my half guinea besides.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet you think her silly, and you are not fond of her at all; and you say\\r\\nyou know this thing will be of no use to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is her birthday, sir; and I am sure she will EXPECT something,\\r\\nand everybody else will give her something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her\\r\\nsomething.  And will you, or can you, or should you, always give, merely\\r\\nbecause others EXPECT, or because somebody else gives?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always?--no, not always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, only on birthdays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, laughing:  \"Now you are making a joke of me, papa, I see; but I\\r\\nthought you liked that people should be generous,--my godmother said that\\r\\nshe did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I, full as well as your godmother; but we have not yet quite\\r\\nsettled what it is to be generous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why is it not generous to make presents?\" said Rosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to\\r\\nanswer.  But, for instance, to make a present of a thing that you know\\r\\ncan be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem, because it is\\r\\nher birthday, and because everybody gives her something, and because she\\r\\nexpects something, and because your godmother says she likes that people\\r\\nshould be generous, seems to me, my dear Rosamond, to be, since I must\\r\\nsay it, rather more like folly than generosity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond looked down upon the basket, and was silent.  \"Then I am a fool,\\r\\nam I?\" said she looking up at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you have made ONE mistake?  No. If you have sense enough to see\\r\\nyour own mistakes, and can afterwards avoid them, you will never be a\\r\\nfool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the carriage stopped, and Rosamond recollected that the basket was\\r\\nuncovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we must observe, that Rosamond\\'s father had not been too severe upon\\r\\nBell when he called her a silly girl.  From her infancy she had been\\r\\nhumoured; and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled\\r\\nchild.  She was idle, fretful, and selfish; so that nothing could make\\r\\nher happy.  On her birthday she expected, however, to be perfectly happy.\\r\\nEverybody in the house tried to please her, and they succeeded so well,\\r\\nthat between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying.  The\\r\\ncause of five of these fits no one could discover:  but the last, and\\r\\nmost lamentable, was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin\\r\\nfrock; and accordingly, at dressing time, her maid brought it to her,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"See here, miss, what your mamma has sent you on your\\r\\nbirthday.  Here\\'s a frock fit for a queen--if it had but lace round the\\r\\ncuffs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why has not it lace around the cuffs? mamma said it should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but mistress was disappointed about the lace; it is not come home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not come home, indeed! and didn\\'t they know it was my birthday?  But\\r\\nthen I say I won\\'t wear it without the lace--I can\\'t wear it without the\\r\\nlace, and I won\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lace, however, could not be had; and Bell at length submitted to let\\r\\nthe frock be put on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Miss Bell, dry your eyes,\" said the maid who educated her; \"dry\\r\\nyour eyes, and I\\'ll tell you something that will please you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then?\" said the child, pouting and sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--but you must not tell that I told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,--but if I am asked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if you are asked, you must tell the truth, to be sure.  So I\\'ll\\r\\nhold my tongue, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, tell me, though, and I\\'ll never tell--if I AM asked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said the maid, \"your cousin Rosamond is come, and has\\r\\nbrought you the most BEAUTIFULLEST thing you ever saw in your life; but\\r\\nyou are not to know anything about it till after dinner, because she\\r\\nwants to surprise you; and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till\\r\\nafter dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Till after dinner!\" repeated Bell, impatiently; \"I can\\'t wait till then;\\r\\nI must see it this minute.\"  The maid refused her several times, till\\r\\nBell burst into another fit of crying, and the maid, fearing that her\\r\\nmistress would be angry with HER, if Bell\\'s eyes were red at dinner time,\\r\\nconsented to show her the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How pretty!--but let me have it in my own hands,\" said Bell, as the maid\\r\\nheld the basket up out of her reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, you must not touch it; for if you should spoil it, what would\\r\\nbecome of me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Become of you, indeed!\" exclaimed the spoiled child, who never\\r\\nconsidered anything but her own immediate gratification--\"Become of YOU,\\r\\nindeed! what signifies that--I sha\\'n\\'t spoil it; and I will have it in my\\r\\nown hands.  If you don\\'t hold it down for me directly, I\\'ll tell that you\\r\\nshowed it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you won\\'t snatch it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, I won\\'t indeed,\" said Bell; but she had learned from her maid a\\r\\ntotal disregard of truth.  She snatched the basket the moment it was\\r\\nwithin her reach.  A struggle ensued, in which the handle and lid were\\r\\ntorn off, and one of the medallions crushed inwards, before the little\\r\\nfury returned to her senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalmed at this sight, the next question was, how she should conceal the\\r\\nmischief which she had done.  After many attempts, the handle and lid\\r\\nwere replaced; the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it\\r\\nhad stood before, and the maid charged the child, \"TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING\\r\\nWAS THE MATTER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to\\r\\nreflect.  The habits of tyranny, meanness, and falsehood, which children\\r\\nacquire from living with bad servants, are scarcely ever conquered in the\\r\\nwhole course of their future lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter shutting up the basket they left the room, and in the adjoining\\r\\npassage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand.\\r\\n\"What\\'s your business?\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have brought home the lace, madam, that was bespoke for the young\\r\\nlady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you have, have you, at last?\" said Bell; \"and pray why didn\\'t you\\r\\nbring it sooner?\"  The girl was going to answer, but the maid interrupted\\r\\nher, saying--\"Come, come, none of your excuses; you are a little idle,\\r\\ngood-for-nothing thing, to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday.  But\\r\\nnow you have brought it, let us look at it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl gave the lace without reply, and the maid desired her to\\r\\ngo about her business, and not to expect to be paid; for that her\\r\\nmistress could not see anybody, BECAUSE she was in a room full of\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I call again, madam, this afternoon?\" said the child, timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless my stars!\" replied the maid, \"what makes people so poor, I\\r\\nWONDERS!  I wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse, as I told\\r\\nher, and not of these folks.  Call again! yes, to be sure.  I believe\\r\\nyou\\'d call, call, call twenty times for twopence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever ungraciously the permission to call again was granted, it was\\r\\nreceived with gratitude.  The little girl departed with a cheerful\\r\\ncountenance; and Bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long\\r\\nwished-for lace upon her cuffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunate Bell!--All dinner time passed, and people were so hungry, so\\r\\nbusy, or so stupid, that not an eye observed her favourite piece of\\r\\nfinery.  Till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience,\\r\\nand turning to Laura, who sat next to her, she said, \"You have no lace\\r\\nupon your cuffs.  Look how beautiful mine is!--is not it?  Don\\'t you wish\\r\\nyour mamma could afford to give some like it?  But you can\\'t get any if\\r\\nshe would, for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday, and nobody\\r\\ncan get a bit more anywhere, if they would give the world for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But cannot the person who made it,\" said Laura, \"make any more like it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Bell; for she had already learned, either from her\\r\\nmaid or her mother, the mean pride which values things not for being\\r\\nreally pretty or useful, but for being such as nobody else can procure.\\r\\n\"Nobody can get any like it, I say,\" repeated Bell; \"nobody in all London\\r\\ncan make it but one person, and that person will never make a bit for\\r\\nanybody but me, I am sure.  Mamma won\\'t let her, if I ask her not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said Laura, coolly, \"I do not want any of it; you need not\\r\\nbe so violent:  I assure you that I don\\'t want any of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you do, though,\" said Bell, more angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed,\" said Laura, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do, in the bottom of your heart; but you say you don\\'t to plague me,\\r\\nI know,\" cried Bell, swelling with disappointed vanity.  \"It is pretty\\r\\nfor all that, and it cost a great deal of money too, and nobody shall\\r\\nhave any like it, if they cried their eyes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura received this declaration in silence--Rosamond smiled; and at her\\r\\nsmile the ill-suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the\\r\\nseventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her\\r\\nbirthday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter, my pet?\" cried her mother; \"come to me, and tell me\\r\\nwhat\\'s the matter.\"  Bell ran roaring to her mother; but no otherwise\\r\\nexplained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with\\r\\nfrantic gestures from her cuffs, and throwing the fragments into her\\r\\nmother\\'s lap.  \"Oh! the lace, child!--are you mad?\" said her mother,\\r\\ncatching hold of both her hands.  \"Your beautiful lace, my dear love--do\\r\\nyou know how much it cost?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care how much it cost--it is not beautiful, and I\\'ll have none\\r\\nof it,\" replied Bell, sobbing; \"for it is not beautiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is beautiful,\" retorted her mother; \"I chose the pattern myself.\\r\\nWho has put it into your head, child, to dislike it?  Was it Nancy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not Nancy, but THEM, mamma,\" said Bell, pointing to Laura and\\r\\nRosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, fie! don\\'t POINT,\" said her mother, putting down her stubborn\\r\\nfinger; \"nor say THEM, like Nancy; I am sure you misunderstood.  Miss\\r\\nLaura, I am sure, did not mean any such thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam; and I did not say any such thing, that I recollect,\" said\\r\\nLaura, gently.  \"Oh, no, indeed!\" cried Rosamond, warmly, rising in her\\r\\nsister\\'s defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo defence or explanation, however, was to be heard, for everybody had\\r\\nnow gathered round Bell, to dry her tears, and to comfort her for the\\r\\nmischief she had done to her own cuffs.  They succeeded so well, that in\\r\\nabout a quarter of an hour the young lady\\'s eyes, and the reddened arches\\r\\nover her eyebrows came to their natural colour; and the business being\\r\\nthus happily hushed up, the mother, as a reward to her daughter for her\\r\\ngood humour, begged that Rosamond would now be so good as to produce her\\r\\n\"charming present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, followed by all the company, amongst whom, to her great joy,\\r\\nwas her godmother, proceeded to the dressing room.  \"Now I am sure,\"\\r\\nthought she, \"Bell will be surprised, and my godmother will see she was\\r\\nright about my generosity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony, and the filigree\\r\\nbasket appeared in all its glory.  \"Well, this is a charming present,\\r\\nindeed!\" said the godmother, who was one of the company; \"MY Rosamond\\r\\nknows how to make presents.\"  And as she spoke, she took hold of the\\r\\nbasket, to lift it down to the admiring audience.  Scarcely had she\\r\\ntouched it, when, lo! the basket fell to the ground, and only the handle\\r\\nremained in her hand.  All eyes were fixed upon the wreck.  Exclamations\\r\\nof sorrow were heard in various tones; and \"Who can have done this?\" was\\r\\nall that Rosamond could say.  Bell stood in sullen silence, which she\\r\\nobstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about\\r\\nthe disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the servants were summoned, and amongst them, Nancy, Miss\\r\\nBell\\'s maid and governess.  She affected much surprise when she saw what\\r\\nhad befallen the basket, and declared that she knew nothing of the\\r\\nmatter, but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite\\r\\nsafe into the wardrobe; and that, for her part, she had never touched it,\\r\\nor thought of touching it, in her born days.  \"Nor Miss Bell, neither,\\r\\nma\\'am,--I can answer for her; for she never knew of its being there,\\r\\nbecause I never so much as mentioned it to her, that there was such a\\r\\nthing in the house, because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her\\r\\nwith the secret; so I never mentioned a sentence of it--did I, Miss\\r\\nBell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBell, putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her,\\r\\nanswered boldly, \"NO;\" but she had hold of Rosamond\\'s hand, and at the\\r\\ninstant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly.  \"Why do you\\r\\nsqueeze my hand so?\" said Rosamond, in a low voice; \"what are you afraid\\r\\nof?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Afraid of!\" cried Bell, turning angrily; \"I\\'m not afraid of anything,--\\r\\nI\\'ve nothing to be afraid about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, I did not say you had,\" whispered Rosamond; \"but only if you did by\\r\\naccident--you know what I mean--I should not be angry if you did--only\\r\\nsay so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say I did not!\" cried Bell, furiously; \"Mamma, mamma!  Nancy! my\\r\\ncousin Rosamond won\\'t believe me!  That\\'s very hard.  It\\'s very rude, and\\r\\nI won\\'t bear it--I won\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be angry, love.  Don\\'t,\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody suspects you, darling,\" said her mother; \"but she has too much\\r\\nsensibility.  Don\\'t cry, love; nobody suspected you.  But you know,\"\\r\\ncontinued she, turning to the maid, \"somebody must have done this, and I\\r\\nmust know how it was done.  Miss Rosamond\\'s charming present must not be\\r\\nspoiled in this way, in my house, without my taking proper notice of it.\\r\\nI assure you I am very angry about it, Rosamond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond did not rejoice in her anger, and had nearly made a sad mistake\\r\\nby speaking aloud her thoughts--\"I WAS VERY FOOLISH--\" she began and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" cried the maid, suddenly, \"I\\'ll venture to say I know who did\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\" said everyone, eagerly.  \"Who?\" said Bell, trembling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, miss, don\\'t you recollect that little girl with the lace, that we\\r\\nsaw peeping about in the passage?  I\\'m sure she must have done it; for\\r\\nhere she was by herself half an hour or more, and not another creature\\r\\nhas been in mistress\\' dressing-room, to my certain knowledge, since\\r\\nmorning.  Those sort of people have so much curiosity.  I\\'m sure she must\\r\\nhave been meddling with it,\" added the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, that\\'s the thing,\" said the mistress, decidedly.  \"Well, Miss\\r\\nRosamond, for your comfort she shall never come into my house again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that would not comfort me at all,\" said Rosamond; \"besides, we are\\r\\nnot sure that she did it, and if--\"  A single knock at the door was heard\\r\\nat this instant.  It was the little girl, who came to be paid for her\\r\\nlace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call her in,\" said the lady of the house; \"let us see her directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid, who was afraid that the girl\\'s innocence would appear if she\\r\\nwere produced, hesitated; but upon her mistress repeating her commands,\\r\\nshe was forced to obey.  The girl came in with a look of simplicity; but\\r\\nwhen she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed.  Rosamond\\r\\nand Laura looked at her and one another with surprise, for it was the\\r\\nsame little girl whom they had seen weaving lace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not it she?\" whispered Rosamond to her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is; but hush,\" said Laura, \"she does not know us.  Don\\'t say a\\r\\nword, let us hear what she will say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke, so that the little\\r\\ngirl could not see her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vastly well!\" said Bell\\'s mother; \"I am waiting to see how long you will\\r\\nhave the assurance to stand there with that innocent look.  Did you ever\\r\\nsee that basket before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am,\" said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YES, MA\\'AM!\" cried the maid; \"and what else do you know about it?  You\\r\\nhad better confess it at once, and mistress, perhaps, will say no more\\r\\nabout it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, do confess it,\" added Bell, earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confess what, madam?\" said the little girl; \"I never touched the basket,\\r\\nmadam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You never TOUCHED it; but you confess,\" interrupted Bell\\'s mother, \"that\\r\\nyou DID SEE it before.  And, pray, how came you to see it?  You must have\\r\\nopened my wardrobe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, ma\\'am,\" said the little girl; \"but I was waiting in the\\r\\npassage, ma\\'am, and this door was partly open; and looking at the maid,\\r\\nyou know, I could not help seeing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe?\" rejoined the\\r\\nlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid, frightened, pulled the little girl by the sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Answer me,\" said the lady, \"where did you see this basket?\"  Another\\r\\nstronger pull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw it, madam, in her hands,\" looking at the maid; \"and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what became of it afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am\"--hesitating--\"miss pulled, and by accident--I believe, I saw,\\r\\nma\\'am--miss, you know what I saw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know--I do not know; and if I did, you had no business there;\\r\\nand mamma won\\'t believe you, I am sure.\"  Everybody else, however, did\\r\\nbelieve; and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her\\r\\nfeel rather ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you all look at me so for?  Why do you all look so?  And am I to\\r\\nbe put to shame on my birthday?\" cried she, bursting into a roar of\\r\\npassion; \"and all for this nasty thing!\" added she, pushing away the\\r\\nremains of the basket, and looking angrily at Rosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bell!  Bell!  O, fie! fie!--Now I am ashamed of you; that\\'s quite rude\\r\\nto your cousin,\" said her mother, who was more shocked at her daughter\\'s\\r\\nwant of politeness than at her falsehood.  \"Take her away, Nancy, till\\r\\nshe has done crying,\" added she to the maid, who accordingly carried off\\r\\nher pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, during this scene, especially at the moment when her present\\r\\nwas pushed away with such disdain, had been making reflections upon the\\r\\nnature of true generosity.  A smile from her father, who stood by, a\\r\\nsilent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket, gave rise to\\r\\nthese reflections; nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of\\r\\nthe rest of the company, nor even by the praises of her godmother, who,\\r\\nfor the purpose of condoling with her, said, \"Well, my dear Rosamond, I\\r\\nadmire your generous spirit.  You know I prophesied that your half-guinea\\r\\nwould be gone the soonest.  Did I not, Laura?\" said she, appealing, in a\\r\\nsarcastic tone, to where she thought Laura was.  \"Where is Laura?  I\\r\\ndon\\'t see her.\"  Laura came forward.  \"You are too PRUDENT to throw away\\r\\nyour money like your sister.  Your half-guinea, I\\'ll answer for it, is\\r\\nsnug in your pocket--Is it not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam,\" answered she, in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut low as the voice of Laura was, the poor little lace-girl heard it;\\r\\nand now, for the first time, fixing her eyes upon Laura, recollected her\\r\\nbenefactress.  \"Oh, that\\'s the young lady!\" she exclaimed, in a tone of\\r\\njoyful gratitude, \"the good, good young lady, who gave me the half-\\r\\nguinea, and would not stay to be thanked for it; but I WILL thank her\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The half-guinea, Laura!\" said her godmother.  \"What is all this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you, madam, if you please,\" said the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not in expectation of being praised for it, that Laura had been\\r\\ngenerous, and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of\\r\\nthe weaving-pillow; and whilst they praised, felt a certain degree of\\r\\nrespect, which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums.\\r\\nRESPECT is not an improper word, even applied to a child of Laura\\'s age;\\r\\nfor let the age or situation of the person be what it may, they command\\r\\nrespect who deserve it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, madam!\" said Rosamond to her godmother, \"now you see--you see she is\\r\\nNOT a little miser.  I\\'m sure that\\'s better than wasting half a guinea\\r\\nupon a filigree basket; is it not, ma\\'am?\" said she, with an eagerness\\r\\nwhich showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy\\r\\nwith her sister.  \"This is being REALLY GENEROUS, father, is it not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Rosamond,\" said her father, and he kissed her; \"this IS being\\r\\nreally generous.  It is not only by giving away money that we can show\\r\\ngenerosity; it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves:\\r\\nand therefore,\" added he, smiling, \"it is really generous of you to give\\r\\nyour sister the thing you like best of all others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The thing I like the best of all others, father,\" said Rosamond, half\\r\\npleased, half vexed.  \"What is that, I wonder?  You don\\'t mean PRAISE, do\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, you must decide that yourself, Rosamond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said she, ingenuously, \"perhaps it WAS ONCE the thing I liked\\r\\nbest; but the pleasure I have just felt makes me like something else much\\r\\nbetter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nETON MONTEM.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Extracted from the \"Courier\" of May, 1799.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday this triennial ceremony took place, with which the public are\\r\\ntoo well acquainted to require a particular description.  A collection,\\r\\ncalled Salt, is taken from the public, which forms a purse, to support\\r\\nthe Captain of the School in his studies at Cambridge.  This collection\\r\\nis made by the Scholars, dressed in fancy dresses, all round the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock, the youths being assembled in their habiliments at\\r\\nthe College, the Royal Family set off from the Castle to see them, and,\\r\\nafter walking round the Courtyard, they proceeded to Salt Hill in the\\r\\nfollowing order:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His Majesty, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and the Earl of\\r\\nUxbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland, Earl Morton,\\r\\nand General Gwynne, all on horseback, dressed in the Windsor uniform,\\r\\nexcept the Prince of Wales, who wore a suit of dark blue, and a brown\\r\\nsurtout over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then followed the Scholars, preceded by the Marechal Serjeant, the\\r\\nMusicians of the Staffordshire Band, and Mr. Ford, Captain of the\\r\\nSeminary, the Serjeant Major, Serjeants, Colonels, Corporals, Musicians,\\r\\nEnsign, Lieutenant, Steward, Salt Bearers, Polemen, and Runners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her amiable daughters in\\r\\ntwo carriages, and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians, all\\r\\neager to behold their Sovereign and his family.  Among the former, Lady\\r\\nLade was foremost in the throng; only two others dared venture their\\r\\npersons on horseback in such a multitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge by Messrs. Young\\r\\nand Mansfield, the Salt Bearers, to whom their Majesties delivered their\\r\\ncustomary donation of fifty guineas each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Salt Hill, his Majesty, with his usual affability, took upon himself\\r\\nto arrange the procession round the Royal carriages; and even when the\\r\\nhorses were taken off, with the assistance of the Duke of Kent, fastened\\r\\nthe traces round the pole of the coaches, to prevent any inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on, the Prince took leave, and\\r\\nwent to the \\'Windmill Inn,\\' till it subsided.  The King and his\\r\\nattendants weathered it out in their great-coats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage, Ensign Vince and\\r\\nthe Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill; but the wind being\\r\\nboisterous, he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag,\\r\\nand the space being too small before the carriages, from the concourse of\\r\\nspectators, the King kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under\\r\\nsuch inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home, the King\\r\\noccasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of Windsor, the Earl of\\r\\nHarrington, and other noblemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the \\'Windmill Inn,\\' and in\\r\\nthe evening walked on Windsor Terrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland, after\\r\\ntaking leave of their Majesties, set off for town, and honoured the Opera\\r\\nHouse with their presence in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The profit arising from the Salt collected, according to account,\\r\\namounted to 8OO pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Stadtholder, the Duke of Gordon, Lord and Lady Melbourne, Viscount\\r\\nBrome, and a numerous train of fashionable nobility, were present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The following is an account of their dresses, made as usual, very\\r\\nhandsomely, by Mrs. Snow, milliner, of Windsor:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Ford, Captain, with eight Gentlemen to attend him as servitors.\\r\\n\"Mr. Sarjeant, Marechal.\\r\\n\"Mr. Bradith, Colonel.\\r\\n\"Mr. Plumtree, Lieutenant.\\r\\n\"Mr. Vince, Ensign.\\r\\n\"Mr. Young, College Salt Bearer; white and gold dress, rich satin bag,\\r\\ncovered with gold netting.\\r\\n\"Mr. Mansfield, Oppidan, white, purple, and orange dress, trimmed with\\r\\nsilver; rich satin bag, purple and silver:  each carrying elegant poles,\\r\\nwith gold and silver cord.\\r\\n\"Mr. Keity, yellow and black velvet; helmet trimmed with silver.\\r\\n\"Mr. Bartelot, plain mantle and sandals, Scotch bonnet, a very Douglas.\\r\\n\"Mr. Knapp, flesh-colour and blue; Spanish hat and feathers.\\r\\n\"Mr. Ripley, rose-colour; helmet.\\r\\n\"Mr. Islip (being in mourning), a scarf; helmet, black velvet; and white\\r\\nsatin.\\r\\n\"Mr. Tomkins, violet and silver; helmet.\\r\\n\"Mr. Thackery, lilac and silver; Roman Cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Drury, mazarin blue; fancy cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Davis, slate-colour and straw.\\r\\n\"Mr. Routh, pink and silver, Spanish hat.\\r\\n\"Mr. Curtis, purple, fancy cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Lloyd, blue; ditto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the conclusion of the ceremony the Royal Family returned to Windsor,\\r\\nand the boys were all sumptuously entertained at the tavern at Salt Hill.\\r\\nAbout six in the evening all the boys returned in the order of\\r\\nprocession, and, marching round the great square of Eton, were dismissed.\\r\\nThe captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family, at the Queen\\'s\\r\\nLodge, Windsor, previously to his departure for King\\'s College,\\r\\nCambridge, to defray which expense the produce of the Montem was\\r\\npresented to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty, rank, and fashion,\\r\\non Windsor Terrace, enlivened by the performance of several bands of\\r\\nmusic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The origin of the procession is from the custom by which the Manor was\\r\\nheld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The custom of hunting the Ram belonged to Eton College, as well as the\\r\\ncustom of Salt; but it was discontinued by Dr. Cook, late Dean of Ely.\\r\\nNow this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the Royal\\r\\nAbbey of Bec, in Normandy, as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great\\r\\nWrotham, in Norfolk, given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec, and was\\r\\nas follows:--When the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half\\r\\nan acre of barley, and a ram let loose; and if they caught him he was\\r\\ntheir own to make merry with; but if he escaped from them he was the\\r\\nLord\\'s.  The Etonians, in order to secure the ram, houghed him in the\\r\\nIrish fashion, and then attacked him with great clubs.  The cruelty of\\r\\nthis proceeding brought it into disuse, and now it exists no longer.--See\\r\\nRegister of the Royal Abbey of Bec, folio 58.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the dissolution of the alien priories, in 1414, by the Parliament\\r\\nof Leicester, they remained in the Crown till Henry VI., who gave Wrotham\\r\\nManor to Eton College; and if the Eton Fellows would search, they would\\r\\nperhaps find the Manor in their possession, that was held by the custom\\r\\nof Salt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlderman Bursal, Father of young Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord John,      )\\r\\nTalbot,         )\\r\\nWheeler,        ) Young Gentlemen of Eton, from 17 to 19 years of age.\\r\\nBursal,         )\\r\\nRory O\\'Ryan     )\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Newington, Landlord of the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\nFarmer Hearty.\\r\\nA Waiter and crowd of Eton Lads.\\r\\n\\r\\nWOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marchioness of Piercefield, Mother of Lord John.\\r\\nLady Violetta--her Daughter, a Child of six or seven years old.\\r\\nMrs. Talbot.\\r\\nLousia Talbot, her Daughter.\\r\\nMiss Bursal, Daughter to the Alderman.\\r\\nMrs. Newington, Landlady of the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\nSally, a Chambermaid.\\r\\nPatty, a Country Girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Pipe and Tabor, and Dance of Peasants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Bar of the \"Windmill Inn\" at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n          MR. and MRS. NEWINGTON, the Landlord and Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  \\'Tis an unpossibility, Mr. Newington; and that\\'s enough.  Say\\r\\nno more about it; \\'tis an unpossibility in the natur of things.  (She\\r\\nranges jellies, etc., in the Bar.)  And pray, do you take your great old\\r\\nfashioned tankard, Mr. Newington, from among my jellies and\\r\\nconfectioneries.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (takes his tankard and drinks).  Anything for a quiet life.  If\\r\\nit is an impossibility, I\\'ve no more to say; only, for the soul of me, I\\r\\ncan\\'t see the great unpossibility, wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Wife, indeed!--wife!--wife! wife every minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Heyday!  Why, what a plague would you have me call you?  The\\r\\nother day you quarrelled with me for calling you Mrs. Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  To be sure I did, and very proper in me I should.  I\\'ve turned\\r\\noff three waiters and five chambermaids already, for screaming after me\\r\\nMrs. Landlady! Mrs. Landlady!  But \\'tis all your ill manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Ill manners!  Why, if I may be so bold, if you are not Mrs.\\r\\nLandlady, in the name of wonder what are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Mrs. Newington, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (drinks).  Mrs. Newington, Mr. Newington drinks your health; for\\r\\nI suppose I must not be landlord any more in my own house (shrugs).\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Oh, as to that, I have no objections nor impediments to your\\r\\nbeing called LANDLORD.  You look it, and become it very proper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, yes, indeed, thank my tankard, I do look it, and become\\r\\nit, and am nowise ashamed of it; but everyone to their mind, as you,\\r\\nwife, don\\'t fancy the being called Mrs. Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  To be sure I don\\'t.  Why, when folks hear the old fashioned\\r\\ncry of Mrs. Landlady! Mrs. Landlady! who do they expect, think you, to\\r\\nsee, but an overgrown, fat, featherbed of a woman, coming waddling along\\r\\nwith her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron, o\\' this fashion?\\r\\nNow, to see me coming, nobody would take me to be a landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Very true, indeed, wife--Mrs. Newington, I mean--I ask pardon;\\r\\nbut now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of\\r\\nletting that old lady, and the civil-spoken young lady there above, have\\r\\nthem there rooms for another day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Now, Mr. Newington, let me hear no more about that old\\r\\ngentlewoman, and that civil-spoken young lady.  Fair words cost nothing;\\r\\nand I\\'ve a notion that\\'s the cause they are so plenty with the young\\r\\nlady.  Neither o\\' them, I take it, by what they\\'ve ordered since their\\r\\ncoming into the house, are such grand folk, that one need be so\\r\\npetticular about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, they came only in a chaise and pair, to be sure; I can\\'t\\r\\ndeny that.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  But, bless my stars! what signifies talking?  Don\\'t you know,\\r\\nas well as I do, Mr. Newington, that to-morrow is Eton Montem, and that\\r\\nif we had twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of\\r\\nthem, it would not be one too many for all the company we\\'ve a right to\\r\\nexpect, and those the highest quality of the land?  Nay, what do I talk\\r\\nof to-morrow? isn\\'t my Lady Piercefield and suite expected? and,\\r\\nmoreover, Mr. and Miss Bursal\\'s to be here, and will call for as much in\\r\\nan hour as your civil-spoken young lady in a twelvemonth, I reckon.  So,\\r\\nMr. Newington, if you don\\'t think proper to go up and inform the ladies\\r\\nabove, that the Dolphin rooms are not for them, I must SPEAK myself,\\r\\nthough \\'tis a thing I never do when I can help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (aside).  She not like to speak!  (Aloud.)  My dear, you can\\r\\nspeak a power better than I can; so take it all upon yourself, if you\\r\\nplease; for, old-fashioned as I and my tankard here be, I can\\'t make a\\r\\nspeech that borders on the uncivil order, to a lady like, for the life\\r\\nand lungs of me.  So, in the name of goodness, do you go up, Mrs.\\r\\nNewington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  And so I will, Mr. Newington.  Help ye!  Civilities and\\r\\nrarities are out o\\' season for them that can\\'t pay for them in this\\r\\nworld; and very proper.  [Exit Landlady.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  And very proper!  Ha! who comes yonder?  The Eton chap who\\r\\nwheedled me into lending him my best hunter last year, and was the\\r\\nruination of him; but that must be paid for, wheedle or no wheedle; and,\\r\\nfor the matter of wheedling, I\\'d stake this here Mr. Wheeler, that is\\r\\nmaking up to me, do you see, against e\\'er a boy, or hobbledehoy, in all\\r\\nEton, London, or Christendom, let the other be who he will.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter WHEELER.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  A fine day, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  A fine day, Mr. Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And I hope, for YOUR sake, we may have as fine a day for the\\r\\nMontem to-morrow.  It will be a pretty penny in your pocket!  Why, all\\r\\nthe world will be here; and (looking round at the jellies, etc.) so much\\r\\nthe better for them; for here are good things enough, and enough for\\r\\nthem.  And here\\'s the best thing of all, the good old tankard still; not\\r\\nempty, I hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Not empty, I hope.  Here\\'s to you, Mr. Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Mr. Wheeler!--CAPTAIN Wheeler, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  YOU, Captain Wheeler!  Why, I thought in former times it was\\r\\nalways the oldest scholar at Eton that was Captain at the Montems; and\\r\\ndidn\\'t Mr. Talbot come afore you?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Not at all; we came on the same day.  Some say I came first; some\\r\\nsay Talbot.  So the choice of which of us is to be captain is to be put\\r\\nto the vote amongst the lads--most votes carry it; and I have most votes,\\r\\nI fancy; so I shall be captain, to-morrow, and a pretty deal of salt* I\\r\\nreckon I shall pocket.  Why, the collection at the last Montem, they say,\\r\\ncame to a plump thousand!  No bad thing for a young fellow to set out\\r\\nwith for Oxford or Cambridge--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\n*Salt, the cant name given by the Eton lads to the money collected at\\r\\nMontem.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  And no bad thing, before he sets out for Cambridge or Oxford,\\r\\n\\'twould be for a young gentleman to pay his debts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Debts!  Oh, time enough for that.  I\\'ve a little account with you\\r\\nin horses, I know; but that\\'s between you and me, you know--mum.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mum me no mums, Mr. Wheeler.  Between you and me, my best\\r\\nhunter has been ruinationed; and I can\\'t afford to be mum.  So you\\'ll\\r\\ntake no offence if I speak; and as you\\'ll set off to-morrow, as soon as\\r\\nthe Montem\\'s over, you\\'ll be pleased to settle with me some way or other\\r\\nto-day, as we\\'ve no other time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No time so proper, certainly.  Where\\'s the little account?--I\\r\\nhave money sent me for my Montem dress, and I can squeeze that much out\\r\\nof it.  I came home from Eton on purpose to settle with you.  But as to\\r\\nthe hunter, you must call upon Talbot--do you understand? to pay for him;\\r\\nfor though Talbot and I had him the same day, \\'twas Talbot did for him,\\r\\nand Talbot must pay.  I spoke to him about it, and charged him to\\r\\nremember you; for I never forget to speak a good word for my friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  So I perceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I\\'ll make bold just to give you my opinion of these jellies\\r\\nwhilst you are getting my account, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\n         (He swallows down a jelly or two--Landlord is going.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter TALBOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot.  Hallo, Landlord! where are making off so fast?  Here, your\\r\\njellies are all going as fast as yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  Talbot!--I wish I was a hundred miles off.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  You are heartily welcome, Mr. Talbot.  A good morning to you,\\r\\nsir; I\\'m glad to see you--very glad to see you, Mr. Talbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Then shake hands, my honest landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Talbot, in shaking hands with him, puts a purse into the landlord\\'s\\r\\nhands.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  What\\'s here?  Guineas?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  The hunter, you know; since Wheeler won\\'t pay, I must--that\\'s all.\\r\\nGood morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (aside).  What a fool!\\r\\n\\r\\n          (Landlord, as Talbot is going, catches hold of his coat.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Hold, Mr. Talbot, this won\\'t do!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Won\\'t it?  Well, then, my watch must go.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Nay, nay! but you are in such a hurry to pay--you won\\'t hear a\\r\\nman.  Half this is enough for your share o\\' the mischief, in all\\r\\nconscience.  Mr. Wheeler, there, had the horse on the same day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  But Bursal\\'s my witness--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, say no more about witnesses; a man\\'s conscience is always his\\r\\nbest witness, or his worst.  Landlord, take your money, and no more\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  This is very genteel of you, Talbot.  I always thought you would\\r\\ndo the genteel thing as I knew you to be so generous and considerate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Don\\'t waste your fine speeches, Wheeler, I advise you, this\\r\\nelection time.  Keep them for Bursal or Lord John, or some of those who\\r\\nlike them.  They won\\'t go down with me.  Good morning to you.  I give you\\r\\nnotice, I\\'m going back to Eton as fast as I can gallop; and who knows\\r\\nwhat plain speaking may do with the Eton lads?  I may be captain yet,\\r\\nWheeler.  Have a care!  Is my horse ready there?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse, there!  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Talbot sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He carries weight--he rides a race--\\r\\n      \\'Tis for a thousand pound!\"                 (Exit Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And, dear me! I shall be left behind.  A horse for me, pray; a\\r\\nhorse for Mr. Wheeler!                            (Exit Wheeler.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (calls very loud).  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse!  Hang the hostler!  I\\'ll\\r\\nsaddle him myself.                           (Exit Landlord.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\n                A Dining room in the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     MRS. TALBOT and LOUISA.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (laughing).  With what an air Mrs. Landlady made her exit!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talbot.  When I was young, they say, I was proud; but I am humble\\r\\nenough now:  these petty mortifications do not vex me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  It is well my brother was gone before Mrs. Landlady made her\\r\\nentree; for if he had heard her rude speech, he would at least have given\\r\\nher the retort courteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Now tell me honestly, my Louisa--You were, a few days ago, at\\r\\nBursal House.  Since you have left it and have felt something of the\\r\\ndifference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour,\\r\\nyou have never regretted that you did not stay there, and that you did\\r\\nnot bear more patiently with Miss Bursal\\'s little airs?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Never for a moment.  At first Miss Bursal paid me a vast deal of\\r\\nattention; but, for what reason I know not, she suddenly changed her\\r\\nmanner, grew first strangely cold, then condescendingly familiar, and at\\r\\nlast downright rude.  I could not guess the cause of these variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb. (aside) I guess the cause too well.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  But as I perceived the lady was out of tune, I was in haste to\\r\\nleave her.  I should make a very bad, and, I am sure, a miserable toad\\r\\neater.  I had much rather, if I were obliged to choose, earn my own\\r\\nbread, than live as toad eater with anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Fine talking, dear Louisa!\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Don\\'t you believe me to be in earnest, mother!  To be sure, you\\r\\ncannot know what I would do, unless I were put to the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Nor you either, my dear.    (She sighs, and is silent.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (takes her mother\\'s hand).  What is the matter, dear mother?  You\\r\\nused to say, that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years\\r\\nyounger; yet even while he was here, you had, in spite of all your\\r\\nefforts to conceal them, those sudden fits of sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  The Montem--is not it to-morrow?  Ay, but my boy is not sure\\r\\nof being captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  No; there is one Wheeler, who, as he says, is most likely to be\\r\\nchosen captain.  He has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over\\r\\nmany to his interest.  My brother does not so much care about it; he is\\r\\nnot avaricious.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I love your generous spirit and his! but, alas! my dear,\\r\\npeople may live to want, and wish for money, without being avaricious.  I\\r\\nwould not say a word to Talbot; full of spirits as he was this morning, I\\r\\nwould not say a word to him, till after the Montem, of what has happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  And what has happened, dear mother?  Sit down,--you tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb. (sits down and puts a letter into Louisa\\'s hand.) Read that,\\r\\nlove.  A messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (reads).  \"By an express from Portsmouth, we hear the Bombay\\r\\nCastle East Indiaman is lost, with all your fortune on board.\"  ALL!  I\\r\\nhope there is something left for you to live upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  About 15O pounds a year for us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  That is enough, is it not, for YOU?\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  For me, love?  I am an old woman, and want but little in this\\r\\nworld, and shall be soon out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (kneels down beside her).  Do not speak so, dearest mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Enough for me, love!  Yes, enough, and too much for me.  I am\\r\\nnot thinking of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Then, as to my brother, he has such abilities, and such\\r\\nindustry, he will make a fortune at the bar for himself, most certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  But his education is not completed.  How shall we provide him\\r\\nwith money at Cambridge?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  This Montem.  The last time the captain had eight hundred, the\\r\\ntime before a thousand, pounds.  Oh, I hope--I fear!  Now, indeed, I know\\r\\nthat, without being avaricious, we may want, and wish for money.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 (Landlady\\'s voice heard behind the scenes.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Waiter!--Miss Bursal\\'s curricle, and Mr. Bursal\\'s vis-a-vis.\\r\\nRun! see that the Dolphin\\'s empty.  I say run!--run!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I will rest for a few moments upon the sofa, in this\\r\\nbedchamber, before we set off.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (goes to open the door).  They have bolted or locked it.  How\\r\\nunlucky!           (She turns the key, and tries to unlock the door.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Enter WAITER.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  Ladies, I\\'m sorry--Miss Bursal and Mr. Bursal are come--just\\r\\ncoming upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Then, will you be so good, sir, as to unlock this door?\\r\\n                                (Waiter tries to unlock the door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  It must be bolted on the inside.  Chambermaid!  Sally!  Are you\\r\\nwithin there?  Unbolt this door.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Mr. Bursal\\'s voice behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs.  Let me have a basin of good soup directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  I\\'ll go round and have the door unbolted immediately, ladies.\\r\\n                                           (Exit Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\n        Enter MISS BURSAL, in a riding dress, and with a long whip.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bursal.  Those creatures, the ponies, have a\\'most pulled my \\'and\\r\\noff.  Who \\'ave we \\'ere?  Ha!  Mrs. Talbot!  Louisa, \\'ow are ye?  I\\'m so\\r\\nvastly glad to see you; but I\\'m so shocked to \\'ear of the loss of the\\r\\nBombay Castle.  Mrs. Talbot, you look but poorly; but this Montem will\\r\\nput everybody in spirits.  I \\'ear everybody\\'s to be \\'ere; and my brother\\r\\ntells me, \\'twill be the finest ever seen at HEton.  Louisa, my dear, I\\'m\\r\\nsorry I\\'ve not a seat for you in my curricle for to-morrow; but I\\'ve\\r\\npromised Lady Betty; so, you know, \\'tis impossible for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Certainly; and it would be impossible for me to leave my mother\\r\\nat present.\\r\\n\\r\\nChambermaid (opens the bedchamber door).  The room\\'s ready now, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Miss Bursal, we intrude upon you no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Nay, why do you decamp, Mrs. Talbot?  I \\'ad a thousand things\\r\\nto say to you, Louisa; but am so tired and so annoyed--\\r\\n\\r\\n         (Seats herself. Exeunt Mrs. Talbot, Louisa and Chambermaid.)\\r\\n\\r\\n          Enter MR. BURSAL, with a basin of soup in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs.  Well, thank my stars the Airly Castle is safe in the Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Mr. Bursal, can you inform me why Joe, my groom, does not\\r\\nmake his appearance?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs. (eating and speaking).  Yes, that I can, child; because he is\\r\\nwith his \\'orses, where he ought to be.  \\'Tis fit they should be looked\\r\\nafter well; for they cost me a pretty penny--more than their heads are\\r\\nworth, and yours into the bargain; but I was resolved, as we were to come\\r\\nto this Montem, to come in style.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  In style, to be sure; for all the world\\'s to be here--the\\r\\nKing, the Prince of WHales, and Duke o\\' York, and all the first people;\\r\\nand we shall cut a dash!  Dash! dash! will be the word to-morrow!--\\r\\n(playing with her whip).\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs. (aside).  Dash! dash! ay, just like her brother.  He\\'ll pay\\r\\naway finely, I warrant, by the time he\\'s her age.  Well, well, he can\\r\\nafford it; and I do love to see my children make a figure for their\\r\\nmoney.  As Jack Bursal says, what\\'s money for, if it e\\'nt to make a\\r\\nfigure.  (Aloud).  There\\'s your, brother Jack, now.  The extravagant dog!\\r\\nhe\\'ll have such a dress as never was seen, I suppose, at this here\\r\\nMontem.  Why, now, Jack Bursal spends more money at Eton, and has more to\\r\\nspend, than my Lord John, though my Lord John\\'s the son of a marchioness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Oh, that makes no difference nowadays.  I wonder whether her\\r\\nladyship is to be at this Montem.  The only good I ever got out of these\\r\\nstupid Talbots was an introduction to their friend Lady Piercefield.\\r\\nWhat she could find to like in the Talbots, heaven knows.  I\\'ve a notion\\r\\nshe\\'ll drop them, when she hears of the loss of the Bombay Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter a WAITER, with a note.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  A note from my Lady Piercefield, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Charming woman!  Is she here, pray, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  Just come.  Yes, ma\\'am.           (Exit Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Well, Mr. Bursal, what is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. B. (reads).  \"Business of importance to communicate--\"  Hum! what can\\r\\nit be?--(going).\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (aside).  Perhaps some match to propose for me!  (Aloud).  Mr.\\r\\nBursal, pray before you go to her ladyship, do send my OOMAN to me to\\r\\nmake me presentable.                (Exit Miss Bursal at one door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. B. (at the opposite door).  \"Business of importance!\"   Hum! I\\'m glad\\r\\nI\\'m prepared with a good basin of soup.  There\\'s no doing business well\\r\\nupon an empty stomach.  Perhaps the business is to lend cash; and I\\'ve no\\r\\ngreat stomach for that.  But it will be an honour, to be sure.\\r\\n                                                    (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Landlady\\'s Parlour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLANDLADY--MR. FINSBURY, a man-milliner, with bandboxes--a fancy cap, or\\r\\nhelmet, with feathers, in the Landlady\\'s hand--a satin bag, covered with\\r\\ngold netting, in the man-milliner\\'s hand--a mantle hanging over his arm.\\r\\nA rough looking Farmer is sitting with his back towards them, eating\\r\\nbread and cheese, and reading a newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Well, this, to be sure, will be the best dressed Montem that\\r\\never was seen at Eton; and you Lon\\'on gentlemen have the most\\r\\nfashionablest notions; and this is the most elegantest fancy cap--\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsbury.  Why, as you observe, ma\\'m, that is the most elegant fancy cap\\r\\nof them all.  That is Mr. Hector Hogmorton\\'s fancy cap, ma\\'m; and here,\\r\\nma\\'m, is Mr. Saul\\'s rich satin bag, covered with gold net.  He is college\\r\\nsalt bearer, I understand, and has a prodigious superb white and gold\\r\\ndress.  But, in my humble opinion, ma\\'m, the marshal\\'s white and purple\\r\\nand orange fancy dress, trimmed with silver, will bear the bell; though,\\r\\nindeed, I shouldn\\'t say that,--for the colonel\\'s and lieutenant\\'s, and\\r\\nensign\\'s, are beautiful in the extreme.  And, to be sure, nothing could\\r\\nbe better imagined than Mr. Marlborough\\'s lilac and silver, with a Roman\\r\\ncap.  And it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better\\r\\neffect than Mr. Drake\\'s flesh-colour and blue, with this Spanish hat,\\r\\nma\\'m, you see.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech,\\r\\nwith contempt.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer (reads the newspaper).  French fleet at sea--Hum!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  O gemini:  Mr. Drake\\'s Spanish hat is the sweetest, tastiest\\r\\nthing!  Mr. Finsbury, I protest--\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  Why, ma\\'m, I knew a lady of your taste couldn\\'t but approve of\\r\\nit.  My own invention entirely, ma\\'m.  But it\\'s nothing to the captain\\'s\\r\\ncap, ma\\'m.  Indeed, ma\\'m, Mr. Wheeler, the captain that is to be, has the\\r\\nprettiest taste in dress.  To be sure, his sandals were my suggestion;\\r\\nbut the mantle he has the entire credit of, to do him justice; and when\\r\\nyou see it, ma\\'m, you will be really surprised; for (for contrast, and\\r\\nelegance, and richness, and lightness, and propriety, and effect, and\\r\\ncostume) you\\'ve never yet seen anything at all to be compared to Captain\\r\\nWheeler\\'s mantle, ma\\'m.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer (to the Landlady).  Why, now, pray, Mrs. Landlady, how long may it\\r\\nhave been the fashion for milliners to go about in men\\'s clothes?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside to Farmer).  Lord, Mr. Hearty, hush!  This is Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, the great man-milliner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  The great man-milliner!  This is a sight I never thought to see in\\r\\nOld England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  (packing up band boxes).  Well, ma\\'m, I\\'m glad I have your\\r\\napprobation.  It has ever been my study to please the ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  (throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat).  And is this the way\\r\\nto please the ladies, Mrs. Landlady, nowadays?\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  (taking off the mantle).  Sir, with your leave--I ask pardon--but\\r\\nthe least thing detriments these tender colours; and as you have just\\r\\nbeen eating cheese with your hands--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  \\'Tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth, man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  MAN!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  I ask pardon--man-milliner, I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter LANDLORD.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, wife!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Wife!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  I ask pardon--Mrs. Newington, I mean.  Do you know who them\\r\\nladies are that you have been and turned out of the Dolphin?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (alarmed).  Not I, indeed.  Who are they, pray?  Why, if they\\r\\nare quality it\\'s no fault of mine.  It is their own fault for coming,\\r\\nlike scrubs, without four horses.  Why, if quality will travel the road\\r\\nthis way, incognito, how can they expect to be known and treated as\\r\\nquality?  \\'Tis no fault of mine.  Why didn\\'t you find out sooner who they\\r\\nwere, Mr. Newington?  What else, in the \\'versal world have you to do, but\\r\\nto go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your\\r\\nhand, from morning till night?  What have you else to ruminate, all day\\r\\nlong, but to find out who\\'s who, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Clapper! clapper! clapper! like my mill in a high wind, landlord.\\r\\nClapper! clapper! clapper!--enough to stun a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  That is not used to it; but use is all, they say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Will you answer me, Mr. Newington?  Who are the grandees that\\r\\nwere in the Dolphin?--and what\\'s become on them?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Grandees was your own word, wife.  They be not to call\\r\\ngrandees; but I reckon you\\'d be sorry not to treat \\'em civil, when I tell\\r\\nyou their name is Talbot, mother and sister to our young Talbot, of Eton;\\r\\nhe that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Mercy! is that all?  What a combustion for nothing in life!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  For nothing in life, as you say, ma\\'m; that is, nothing in high\\r\\nlife, I\\'m sure, ma\\'m; nay, I dare a\\'most venture to swear.  Would you\\r\\nbelieve it, Mr. Talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of Eton that has\\r\\nnot bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand Montem?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  There, Mr. Newington; there\\'s your Talbot for you! and there\\'s\\r\\nyour grandees!  O trust me, I know your scrubs at first sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Scrubs, I don\\'t, nor can\\'t, nor won\\'t call them that pay their\\r\\ndebts honestly.  Scrubs, I don\\'t, nor won\\'t, nor can\\'t, call them that\\r\\nbehave as handsome as young Mr. Talbot did here to me this morning about\\r\\nthe hunter.  A scrub he is not, wife.  Fancy-dress or no fancy-dress, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, this young gentleman is no scrub.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  Dear me!  \\'Twas not I said SCRUB.  Did I say scrub?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No matter if you did.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  No matter, certainly; and yet it is a matter; for I\\'m confident I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t for the world leave it in anyone\\'s power to say that I said--\\r\\nthat I called--any young gentleman of Eton a SCRUB!  Why, you know, sir,\\r\\nit might breed a riot!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  And a pretty figure you\\'d make in a riot!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Nor about scrubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  But I beg leave to explain, gentlemen.  All I ventured to remark\\r\\nor suggest was, that as there was some talk of Mr. Talbot\\'s being captain\\r\\nto-morrow, I didn\\'t conceive how he could well appear without any dress.\\r\\nThat was all, upon my word and honour.  A good morning to you, gentlemen;\\r\\nit is time for me to be off.  Mrs. Newington, you were so obliging as to\\r\\npromise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as Eton.\\r\\n(Finsbury bows and exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  A good day to you and your bandboxes.  There\\'s a fellow for you\\r\\nnow!  Ha! ha! ha!--A man-milliner, forsooth!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mrs. Talbot\\'s coming--stand back.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Lord! why does Bob show them through this way?\\r\\n\\r\\n    Enter MRS. TALBOT, leaning on LOUISA; Waiter showing the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  You are going on, I suppose, ma\\'am?\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter (aside to Landlord).  Not if she could help it; but there\\'s no\\r\\nbeds, since Mr. Bursal and Miss Bursal\\'s come.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  I say nothing, for it is vain to say more.  But isn\\'t it a\\r\\npity she can\\'t stay for the Montem, poor old lady!  Her son--as good and\\r\\nfine a lad as ever you saw--they say, has a chance, too, of being\\r\\ncaptain.  She may never live to see another such a sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n     (As Mrs. Talbot walks slowly on, the Farmer puts himself across her\\r\\nway, so as to stop her short.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No offence, madam, I hope; but I have a good snug farm house, not\\r\\nfar off hand; and if so be you\\'d be so good to take a night\\'s lodging,\\r\\nyou and the young lady with you, you\\'d have a hearty welcome.  That\\'s all\\r\\nI can say and you\\'d make my wife very happy; for she\\'s a good woman, to\\r\\nsay nothing of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  If I may be so bold to put in my word, madam, you\\'d have as\\r\\ngood beds, and be as well lodged, with Farmer Hearty, as in e\\'er a house\\r\\nat Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I am very much obliged--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  O, say nothing o\\' that, madam.  I am sure I shall be as much\\r\\nobliged if you do come.  Do, miss, speak for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Pray, dear mother--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  She will.  (Calls behind the scenes.)  Here, waiter! hostler!\\r\\ndriver! what\\'s your name? drive the chaise up here to the door, smart,\\r\\nclose.  Lean on my arm, madam, and we\\'ll have you in and home in a whiff.\\r\\n(Exeunt Mrs. Talbot, Louisa, Farmer, Landlord and Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (sola).  What a noise and a rout this farmer man makes! and my\\r\\nhusband, with his great broad face, bowing, as great a nincompoop as\\r\\nt\\'other.  The folks are all bewitched with the old woman, I verily\\r\\nbelieve.  (Aloud.) A good morning to you, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          END OF THE FIRST ACT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             ACT THE SECOND.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\nA field near Eton College;--several boys crossing backwards and forwards\\r\\nin the back-ground.  In front, TALBOT, WHEELER, LORD JOHN and BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot.  Fair play, Wheeler!  Have at \\'em, my boy!  There they stand,\\r\\nfair game!  There\\'s Bursal there, with his dead forty-five votes at\\r\\ncommand; and Lord John with his--how many live friends?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord John (coolly).  Sir, I have fifty-six friends, I believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Fifty-six friends, his lordship believes--Wheeler inclusive, no\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  That\\'s as hereafter may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Hereafter! Oh, fie, my LUD!  You know your own Wheeler has,\\r\\nfrom the first minute he ever saw you, been your fast friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Your fast friend from the first minute he ever saw you, my lord!\\r\\nThat\\'s well hit, Wheeler; stick to that; stick fast.  Fifty-six friends,\\r\\nWheeler INclusive, hey, my lord! hey, my LUD!\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Talbot EXclusive, I find, contrary to my expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Ay, contrary to your expectations, you find that Talbot is not a\\r\\ndog that will lick the dust:  but then there\\'s enough of the true spaniel\\r\\nbreed to be had for whistling for; hey, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nBursal (aside to Wheeler).  A pretty electioneerer.  So much the better\\r\\nfor you, Wheeler.  Why, unless he bought a vote, he\\'d never win one, if\\r\\nhe talked from this to the day of judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler (aside to Bursal).  And as he has no money to buy votes--he! he!\\r\\nhe!--we are safe enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  That\\'s well done, Wheeler; fight the by-battle there with Bursal.\\r\\nNow you are sure of the main with Lord John.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Sure! I never made Mr. Wheeler any promise yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  O; I ask no promise from his lordship; we are upon honour:  I\\r\\ntrust entirely to his lordship\\'s good nature and generosity, and to his\\r\\nregard for his own family; I having the honour, though distantly, to be\\r\\nrelated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Related!  How, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Connected, I mean, which is next door, as I may say, to being\\r\\nrelated.  Related slipped out by mistake; I beg pardon, my Lord John.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Related!--a strange mistake, Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Overshot yourself, Wheeler; overshot yourself, by all that\\'s\\r\\nawkward.  And yet, till now, I always took you for \"a dead-shot at a\\r\\nyellow-hammer.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Young noblemen at Oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps.\\r\\nHence their flatterers are said to be dead-shots at yellow-hammers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (taking Bursal by the arm).  Bursal, a word with you.  (Aside to\\r\\nBursal.)  What a lump of family pride that Lord John is.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Keep out of my hearing, Wheeler, lest I should spoil sport.  But\\r\\nnever fear:  you\\'ll please Bursal sooner than I shall.  I can\\'t, for the\\r\\nsoul of me, bring myself to say that Bursal\\'s not purse-proud, and you\\r\\ncan.  Give you joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  A choice electioneerer!--ha! ha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (faintly).  He! he! he!--a choice electioneerer, as you say.\\r\\n          (Exeunt Wheeler and Bursal; manent Lord J. and Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  There was a time, Talbot--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  There was a time, my lord--to save trouble and a long explanation-\\r\\n-there was a time when you liked Talbots better than spaniels; you\\r\\nunderstand me?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have found it very difficult to understand you of late, Mr.\\r\\nTalbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Yes, because you have used other people\\'s understandings instead\\r\\nof your own.  Be yourself, my lord.  See with your own eyes, and hear\\r\\nwith your own ears, and then you\\'ll find me still, what I\\'ve been these\\r\\nseven years; not your understrapper, your hanger-on, your flatterer, but\\r\\nyour friend!  If you choose to have me for a friend, here\\'s my hand.  I\\r\\nam your friend, and you\\'ll not find a better.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (giving his hand).  You are a strange fellow, Talbot; I thought I\\r\\nnever could have forgiven you for what you said last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  What? for I don\\'t keep a register of my sayings.  Oh, it was\\r\\nsomething about gaming--Wheeler was flattering your taste for it, and he\\r\\nput me into a passion--I forget what I said.  But, whatever it was, I\\'m\\r\\nsure it was well meant, and I believe it was well said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But you laugh at me sometimes to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Would you rather I should laugh at you behind your back?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord. J.  But of all things in the world I hate to be laughed at.  Listen\\r\\nto me, and don\\'t fumble in your pockets while I\\'m talking to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I\\'m fumbling for--oh, here it is.  Now, Lord John, I once did\\r\\nlaugh at you behind your back, and what\\'s droll enough, it was at your\\r\\nback I laughed.  Here\\'s a caricature I drew of you--I really am sorry I\\r\\ndid it; but \\'tis best to show it to you myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  It is all I can do to forgive this.  (After a pause, he\\r\\ntears the paper.)  I have heard of this caricature before; but I did not\\r\\nexpect, Talbot, that you would come and show it to me, yourself, Talbot,\\r\\nso handsomely, especially at such a time as this.  Wheeler might well say\\r\\nyou are a bad electioneerer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, hang it!  I forgot my election, and your fifty-six friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (claps Talbot on the back).  Fifty-six friends, have you, Talbot?\\r\\nSay seven--fifty-seven, I mean; for I\\'ll lay you a wager, you\\'ve forget\\r\\nme; and that\\'s a shame for you, too; for out of the whole posse-comitatus\\r\\nentirely now, you have not a stauncher friend than Poor little Rory\\r\\nO\\'Ryan.  And a good right he has to befriend you; for you stood by him\\r\\nwhen many who ought to have known better were hunting him down for a wild\\r\\nIrishman.  Now that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as\\r\\nany tame Englishman of them all.  But don\\'t let\\'s be talking sintimint;\\r\\nfor, for my share I\\'d not give a bogberry a bushel for sintimint, when I\\r\\ncould get anything better.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  And pray, sir, what may a bogberry be?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Phoo! don\\'t be playing the innocent, now.  Where have you lived\\r\\nall your life (I ask pardon, my LARD) not to know a bogberry when you see\\r\\nor hear of it?  (Turns to Talbot.)  But what are ye standing idling here\\r\\nfor?  Sure, there\\'s Wheeler, and Bursal along with him, canvassing out\\r\\nyonder at a terrible fine rate.  And haven\\'t I been huzzaing for you\\r\\nthere till I\\'m hoarse?  So I am, and just stepped away to suck an orange\\r\\nfor my voice--(sucks an orange.)  I am a THOROUGH GOING friend, at\\r\\nanyrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Now, Rory, you are the best fellow in the world, and a THOROUGH\\r\\nGOING friend; but have a care, or you\\'ll get yourself and me into some\\r\\nscrape, before you have done with this violent THOROUGH GOING work.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Never fear! never fear, man!--a warm frind and a bitter enemy,\\r\\nthat\\'s my maxim.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Yes, but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, never fear me!  I\\'m as cool as a cucumber all the time; and\\r\\nwhilst they tink I\\'m tinking of nothing in life but making a noise, I\\r\\nmake my own snug little remarks in prose and verse, as--now my voice is\\r\\nafter coming back to me, you shall hear, if you plase.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I do please.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  I call it Rory\\'s song.  Now, mind, I have a verse for everybody--\\r\\no\\' the leading lads, I mean; and I shall put \\'em in or lave \\'em out,\\r\\naccording to their inclinations and deserts, wise-a-wee to you, my little\\r\\nfrind.  So you comprehend it will be Rory\\'s song, with variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot and Lord John.  Let\\'s have it; let\\'s have it without further\\r\\npreface.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I\\'m true game to the last, and no WHEELER for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  There\\'s a stroke, in the first place, for Wheeler,--you take it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  O yes, yes, we take it; go on.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I\\'m true game to the last, and no Wheeler for me.\\r\\n      Of all birds, beasts, or fishes, that swim in the sea,\\r\\n      Webb\\'d or finn\\'d, black or white, man or child, Whig or Tory,\\r\\n      None but Talbot, O, Talbot\\'s the dog for Rory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. \"Talbot the dog\" is much obliged to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But if I have any ear, one of your lines is a foot too long, Mr.\\r\\nO\\'Ryan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Phoo, put the best foot foremost for a frind.  Slur it in the\\r\\nsinging, and don\\'t be quarrelling, anyhow, for a foot more or less.  The\\r\\nmore feet the better it will stand, you know.  Only let me go on, and\\r\\nyou\\'ll come to something that will plase you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  That\\'s Bursal, mind now, whom I mean to allude to in this verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  If the allusion\\'s good, we shall probably find out your meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  On with you, Rory, and don\\'t read us notes on a song.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Go on, and let us hear what you say of Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm;\\r\\n      His father\\'s a tanner,--but then where\\'s the harm?\\r\\n      Heir to houses, and hunters, and horseponds in fee,\\r\\n      Won\\'t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Encore! encore!  Why, Rory, I did not think you could make so\\r\\ngood a song.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Sure \\'twas none of I made it--\\'twas Talbot here.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory. (aside).  Not a word:  I\\'ll make you a present of it:  sure, then,\\r\\nit\\'s your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I never wrote a word of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory. (to Lord J.).  Phoo, Phoo! he\\'s only denying it out of false\\r\\nmodesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord. J.  Well, no matter who wrote it,--sing it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Be easy; so I will, and as many more verses as you will to the\\r\\nback of it.  (Winking at Talbot aside.)  You shall have the credit of\\r\\nall.  (Aloud.)  Put me in when I\\'m out, Talbot, and you (to Lord John)\\r\\njoin--join.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Rory sings, and Lord John sings with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm;\\r\\n      His father\\'s a tanner,--but then where\\'s the harm?\\r\\n      Heir to houses, and hunters, and horseponds in fee,\\r\\n      Won\\'t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree?\\r\\n      There\\'s my lord with the back that never was bent--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lord John stops singing; Talbot makes signs to Rory to stop; but Rory\\r\\ndoes not see him, and sings on.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"There\\'s my lord with the back that never was bent;\\r\\n      Let him live with his ancestors, I am content.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                 (Rory pushes Lord J. and Talbot with his elbows.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Join, join, both of ye--why don\\'t you join?  (Sings.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Who\\'ll buy my Lord John? the arch fishwoman cried,\\r\\n      A nice oyster shut up in a choice shell of pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But join or ye spoil all.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  You have spoiled all, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (making a formal low bow).  Mr. Talbot, Lord John thanks you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Lord John! blood and thunder!  I forgot you were by--quite and\\r\\nclean.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (puts him aside and continues speaking to Talbot).  Lord John\\r\\nthanks you, Mr. Talbot:  this is the second part of the caricature.  Lord\\r\\nJohn thanks you for these proofs of friendship--Lord John has reason to\\r\\nthank you, Mr. Talbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  No reason in life now.  Don\\'t be thanking so much for nothing in\\r\\nlife; or if you must be thanking of somebody, it\\'s me you ought to thank.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I ought and do, sir, for unmasking one who--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. (warmly).  Unmasking, my lord--\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (holding them asunder).  Phoo! phoo! phoo! be easy, can\\'t ye?--\\r\\nthere\\'s no unmasking at all in the case.  My Lord John, Talbot\\'s writing\\r\\nthe song was all a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  As much a mistake as your singing it, sir, I presume--\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Just as much.  \\'Twas all a mistake.  So now don\\'t you go and make\\r\\na mistake into a misunderstanding.  It was I made every word of the song\\r\\nout o\\' the face*--that about the back that never was bent, and the\\r\\nancestors of the oyster, and all.  He did not waste a word of it; upon my\\r\\nconscience, I wrote it all--though I\\'ll engage you didn\\'t think I could\\r\\nwrite a good thing.  (Lord John turns away.)  I\\'m telling you the truth,\\r\\nand not a word of a lie, and yet you won\\'t believe me.\\r\\n\\r\\n*From beginning to end.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You will excuse me, sir, if I cannot believe two contradictory\\r\\nassertions within two minutes.  Mr. Talbot, I thank you (going).\\r\\n\\r\\n(Rory tries to stop Lord John from going, but cannot.--Exit Lord John.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Well, if he WILL go, let him go then, and much good may it do him.\\r\\nNay, but don\\'t you go too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  O Rory, what have you done?--(Talbot runs after Lord J.)  Hear me,\\r\\nmy lord.                                 (Exit Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Hear him! hear him! hear him!--Well, I\\'m point blank mad with\\r\\nmyself for making this blunder; but how could I help it?  As sure as ever\\r\\nI am meaning to do the best thing on earth, it turns out the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter a party of lads, huzzaing.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (joins.)  Huzza! huzza!--Who, pray, are ye huzzaing for?\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Boy.  Wheeler! Wheeler for ever! huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza!  Captain Talbot for ever! huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Boy.  CAPTAIN he\\'ll never be,--at least not to-morrow; for Lord John\\r\\nhas just declared for Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nlst Boy.  And that turns the scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, the scale may turn back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd Boy.  Impossible!  Lord John has just given his promise to Wheeler.\\r\\nI heard him with my own ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Several speak at once.)  And I heard him; and I! and I! and I!--Huzza!\\r\\nWheeler for ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, murder! murder! murder!  (Aside.)  This goes to my heart! it\\'s\\r\\nall my doing.  O, my poor Talbot!-- murder! murder! murder!  But I won\\'t\\r\\nlet them see me cast down, and it is good to be huzzaing at all events.\\r\\nHuzza for Talbot!  Talbot for ever! huzza!      (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter WHEELER and BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Who was that huzzaing for Talbot?\\r\\n\\r\\n(Rory behind the scenes, \"Huzza for Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Pooh, it is only Rory O\\'Ryan, or the roaring lion as I call him.\\r\\nHa! ha! ha!  Rory O\\'Ryan, alias O\\'Ryan, the roaring lion; that\\'s a good\\r\\none; put it about--Rory O\\'Ryan, the roaring lion, ha! ha! ha! but you\\r\\ndon\\'t take it--you don\\'t laugh, Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Ha! ha! ha!  O, upon my honour I do laugh; ha! ha! ha!\\r\\n(Aside).  It is the hardest work to laugh at his wit.  (Aloud.)  Rory\\r\\nO\\'Ryan, the roaring lion--ha! ha! ha!  You know I always laugh, Bursal,\\r\\nat your jokes--he! he! he!--ready to kill myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (sullenly).  You are easily killed, then, if that much laughing\\r\\nwill do the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (coughing).  Just then--something stuck in my throat; I beg your\\r\\npardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (still sullen).  Oh, you need not beg my pardon about the matter.\\r\\nI don\\'t care whether you laugh or no--not I.  Now you have got Lord John\\r\\nto declare for you, you are above laughing at my jokes, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No, upon my word and honour, I DID laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  A fig for your word and honour.  (Aloud.)  I know I\\'m of\\r\\nno consequence now;  but you\\'ll remember, that if his lordship has the\\r\\nhonour of making you captain, he must have the honour to pay for your\\r\\ncaptain\\'s accoutrements; for I sha\\'n\\'t pay the piper, I promise you,\\r\\nsince I\\'m of no consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Of no consequence!  But, my dear Bursal, what could put that into\\r\\nyour head? that\\'s the strangest, oddest fancy.  Of no consequence!\\r\\nBursal, of no consequence!  Why, everybody that knows anything--everybody\\r\\nthat has seen Bursal House--knows that you are of the greatest\\r\\nconsequence, my dear Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (taking out his watch, and opening it, looks at it).  No, I\\'m of no\\r\\nconsequence.  I wonder that rascal Finsbury is not come yet with the\\r\\ndresses (still looking at his watch).\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  If Bursal takes it into his head not to lend me the\\r\\nmoney to pay for my captain\\'s dress, what will become of me? for I have\\r\\nnot a shilling--and Lord John won\\'t pay for me--and Finsbury has orders\\r\\nnot to leave the house till he is paid by everybody.  What will become of\\r\\nme?--(bites his nails).\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  How I love to make him bite his nails!  (Aloud.)  I know\\r\\nI\\'m of no consequence.  (Strikes his repeater.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  What a fine repeater that is of yours, Bursal!  It is the best I\\r\\never heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  So it well may be; for it cost a mint of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No matter to you what anything costs.  Happy dog as you are!  You\\r\\nroll in money; and yet you talk of being of no consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  But I am not of half so much consequence as Lord John--am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Are you?  Why, aren\\'t you twice as rich as he!\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Very true, but I\\'m not purse-proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  You purse-proud!  I should never have thought of such a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Nor I, if Talbot had not used the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  But Talbot thinks everybody purse-proud that has a purse.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  Well, this Wheeler does put one into a good humour with\\r\\none\\'s self in spite of one\\'s teeth.  (Aloud.)  Talbot says blunt things;\\r\\nbut I don\\'t think he\\'s what you can call clever--hey, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Clever?  Oh, not he.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  I think I could walk round him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  To be sure you could.  Why, do you know, I\\'ve quizzed him\\r\\nfamously myself within this quarter of an hour!\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Indeed! I wish I had been by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  So do I, \\'faith!  It was the best thing.  I wanted, you see, to\\r\\nget him out of my way, that I might have the field clear for\\r\\nelectioneering to-day.  So I bowls up to him with a long face--such a\\r\\nface as this.  Mr. Talbot, do you know--I\\'m sorry to tell you, here\\'s\\r\\nJack Smith has just brought the news from Salt Hill.  Your mother, in\\r\\ngetting into the carriage, slipped, and has BROKE her leg, and there\\r\\nshe\\'s lying at a farmhouse, two miles off.  Is not it true, Jack? said I.\\r\\nI saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes, cries Jack.  Off goes\\r\\nTalbot like an arrow.  Quizzed him, quizzed him! said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Ha! ha! ha! quizzed him indeed, with all his cleverness; that was\\r\\nfamously done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Ha! ha! ha!  With all his cleverness he will be all the evening\\r\\nhunting for the farmhouse and the mother that has broke her leg; so he is\\r\\nout of our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  But what need have you to want him out of your way, now Lord John\\r\\nhas come over to your side?  You have the thing at a dead beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Not so dead either; for there\\'s a great independent party, you\\r\\nknow; and if YOU don\\'t help me, Bursal, to canvass them, I shall be no\\r\\ncaptain.  It is you I depend upon after all.  Will you come and canvass\\r\\nthem with me?  Dear Bursal, pray--all depends upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                (Pulls him by the arm--Bursal follows.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Well, if all depends upon me, I\\'ll see what I can do for you.\\r\\n(Aside.)  Then I am of some consequence!  Money makes a man of some\\r\\nconsequence, I see; at least with some folks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the back scene a flock of sheep are seen penned.  In front, a party of\\r\\ncountry lads and lasses, gaily dressed, as in sheep-shearing time, with\\r\\nribands and garlands of flowers, etc., are dancing and singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter PATTY, dressed as the Queen of the Festival, with a lamb in her\\r\\narms.  The dancers break off when she comes in, and direct their\\r\\nattention towards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Peasant.  Oh, here comes Patty!  Here comes the Queen o\\' the day.\\r\\nWhat has kept you from us so long, Patty?\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Peasant.  \"Please your Majesty,\" you should say.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatty.  This poor little lamb of mine was what kept me so long.  It\\r\\nstrayed away from the rest; and I should have lost him, so I should, for\\r\\never, if it had not been for a good young gentleman.  Yonder he is,\\r\\ntalking to Farmer Hearty.  That\\'s the young gentleman who pulled my lamb\\r\\nout of the ditch for me, into which he had fallen--pretty creature!\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Peasant.  Pretty creature--or, your Majesty, whichever you choose to\\r\\nbe called--come and dance with them, and I\\'ll carry your lamb.\\r\\n                                (Exeunt, singing and dancing.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter FARMER HEARTY and TALBOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer.  Why, young gentleman, I\\'m glad I happened to light upon you\\r\\nhere, and so to hinder you from going farther astray, and set your heart\\r\\nat ease like.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Thanks, good farmer, you have set my heart at ease, indeed.  But\\r\\nthe truth is, they did frighten me confoundedly--more fool I.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No fool at all, to my notion.  I should, at your age, ay, or at my\\r\\nage, just the self-same way have been frightened myself, if so be that\\r\\nmention had been made to me, that way, of my own mother\\'s having broke\\r\\nher leg or so.  And greater, by a great deal, the shame for them that\\r\\nfrighted you, than for you to be frighted.  How young gentlemen, now, can\\r\\nbring themselves for to tell such lies, is to me, now, a matter of\\r\\namazement, like, that I can\\'t noways get over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, farmer, such lies are very witty, though you and I don\\'t just\\r\\nnow like the wit of them.  This is fun, this is quizzing; but you don\\'t\\r\\nknow what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, but I do though, to my cost, ever since last year.  Look you,\\r\\nnow, at yon fine field of wheat.  Well, it was just as fine, and finer,\\r\\nlast year, till a young Eton jackanapes--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Take care what you say, farmer; for I am a young Eton jackanapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No; but you be not the young Eton jackanapes that I\\'m a-thinking\\r\\non.  I tell you it was this time last year, man; he was a-horseback, I\\r\\ntell ye, mounted upon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting, like.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I tell you it was this time last year, man, that I was mounted\\r\\nupon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Zooks! would you argufy a man out of his wits?  You won\\'t go for\\r\\nto tell me that you are that impertinent little jackanapes!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  No! no!  I\\'ll not tell you that I am an impertinent little\\r\\njackanapes!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm (wiping his forehead).  Well, don\\'t then, for I can\\'t believe it;\\r\\nand you put me out.  Where was I?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Mounted upon a fine bay hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, so he was.  \"Here, YOU,\" says he, meaning me--\"open this gate\\r\\nfor me.\"  Now, if he had but a-spoke me fair, I would not have gainsaid\\r\\nhim:  but he falls to swearing, so I bid him open the gate for himself.\\r\\n\"There\\'s a bull behind you, farmer,\" says he.  I turns.  \"Quizzed him!\"\\r\\ncries my jackanapes, and off he gallops him, through the very thick of my\\r\\ncorn; but he got a fall, leaping the ditch out yonder, which pacified me,\\r\\nlike, at the minute.  So I goes up to see whether he was killed; but he\\r\\nwas not a whit the worse for his tumble.  So I should ha\\' fell into a\\r\\npassion with him then, to be sure, about my corn; but his horse had got\\r\\nsuch a terrible sprain, I couldn\\'t say anything to him; for I was a-\\r\\npitying the poor animal.  As fine a hunter as ever you saw!  I am sartain\\r\\nsure he could never come to good after.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. (aside).  I do think, from the description, that this was Wheeler;\\r\\nand I have paid for the horse which he spoiled!  (Aloud.) Should you know\\r\\neither the man or the horse again, if you were to see them?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I should, to my dying day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Will you come with me, then, and you\\'ll do me some guineas\\' worth\\r\\nof service?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I will, with a deal of pleasure; for you be a civil\\r\\nspoken young gentleman; and, besides, I don\\'t think the worse on you for\\r\\nbeing FRIGHTED a little about your mother; being what I might ha\\' been,\\r\\nat your age, myself; for I had a mother myself once.  So lead on, master.\\r\\n(Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         END OF THE SECOND ACT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              ACT THE THIRD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\n             The garden of the \"Windmill Inn,\" at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n           MISS BURSAL, MRS. NEWINGTON, SALLY, the Chambermaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Miss Bursal, in a fainting state, is sitting on a garden stool, and\\r\\nleaning her head against the Landlady.  Sally is holding a glass of water\\r\\nand a smelling bottle.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bursal.  Where am I?  Where am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  At the \"Windmill,\" at Salt Hill, young lady; and ill or well,\\r\\nyou can\\'t be better.\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  Do you find yourself better since coming into the air, miss?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Better!  Oh, I shall never be better!\\r\\n (Leans her head on hand, and rocks herself backwards and forwards.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  My dear young lady, don\\'t take on so.  (Aside.)  Now would I\\r\\ngive something to know what it was my Lady Piercefield said to the\\r\\nfather, and what the father said to this one, and what\\'s the matter at\\r\\nthe bottom of affairs.  Sally, did you hear anything at the doors?\\r\\n\\r\\nSally (aside).  No, indeed, ma\\'am; I never BE\\'S at the doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside).  Simpleton!  (Aloud.)  But, my dear Miss Bursal, if I\\r\\nmay be so bold--if you\\'d only disembosom your mind of what\\'s on it--\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Disembosom my mind!  Nonsense!  I\\'ve nothing on my mind.  Pray\\r\\nleave me, madam.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside).  Madam, indeed! madam, forsooth!  Oh, I\\'ll make her pay\\r\\nfor that!  That MADAM shall go down in the bill, as sure as my name\\'s\\r\\nNewington.  (Landlady, in a higher tone.)  Well, I wish you better,\\r\\nma\\'am.  I suppose I\\'d best send your own servant?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (sullenly).  Yes, I suppose so.  (To Sally.)  You need not wait,\\r\\nchild, nor look so curious.\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  CUR\\'OUS!  Indeed, miss, if I look a little CUR\\'OUS, or so\\r\\n(looking at her dress), \\'tis only because I was FRIGHTED to see you take\\r\\non, which made me forget my clean apron, when I came out; and this apron-\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Hush!  Hush! child.  Don\\'t tell me about clean aprons, nor run\\r\\non with your vulgar talk.  Is there ever a seat one can set on in that\\r\\n_H_arbour yonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  O dear \\'ART, yes, miss; \\'tis the pleasantest _H_arbour on\\r\\n_H_earth.  Be pleased to lean on my _H_arm, and you\\'ll soon be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (going).  Then tell my woman she need not come to me, and let\\r\\nnobody INTERUDE on me--do you \\'EAR?  (Aside.)  Oh, what will become of\\r\\nme? and the Talbots will soon know it!  And the ponies, and the curricle,\\r\\nand the vis-a-vis--what will become of them? and how shall I make my\\r\\nappearance at the Montem, or any WARE else?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\n                LORD JOHN--WHEELER--BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Well, but my lord--Well, but Bursal--though my Lady\\r\\nPiercefield--though Miss Bursal is come to Salt Hill, you won\\'t leave us\\r\\nall at sixes and sevens.  What can we do without you?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You can do very well without me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBursal.  You can do very well without me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (to Burs.).  Impossible!--impossible! You know Mr. Finsbury will\\r\\nbe here just now, with the dresses; and we have to try them on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  And to pay for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And to settle about the procession.  And then, my lord, the\\r\\nelection is to come on this evening.  You won\\'t go till that\\'s over, as\\r\\nyour lordship has PROMISED me your lordship\\'s vote and interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  My vote I promised you, Mr. Wheeler; but I said not a syllable\\r\\nabout my INTEREST.  My friends, perhaps, have not been offended, though I\\r\\nhave, by Mr. Talbot.  I shall leave them to their own inclinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  (whistling).  Wheugh! wheugh! wheugh!  Wheeler, the principal\\'s\\r\\nnothing without the interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Oh, the interest will go along with the principal, of course; for\\r\\nI\\'m persuaded, if my lord leaves his friends to their inclinations, it\\r\\nwill be the inclination of my lord\\'s friends to vote as he does, if he\\r\\nsays nothing to them to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I told you, Mr. Wheeler, that I should leave them to themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (still whistling).  Well, I\\'ll do my best to make that father of\\r\\nmine send me off to Oxford.  I\\'m sure I\\'m fit to go--along with Wheeler.\\r\\nWhy, you\\'d best be my tutor, Wheeler!--a devilish good thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  An excellent thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  And a cursed fine dust we should kick up at Oxford, with your\\r\\nMontem money and all!--Money\\'s THE GO after all.  I wish it was come to\\r\\nmy making you my last bow, \"ye distant spires, ye ANTIC towers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (aside to Lord J.).  Ye ANTIC towers!--fit for Oxford, my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Antique towers, I suppose Mr. Bursal means.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Antique, to be sure!--I said antique, did not I, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  O, yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  What a mean animal is this!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Why, now, what\\'s become of Talbot, I want to know?  There he is\\r\\nnot to be found anywhere in the wide world; and there\\'s a hullabaloo\\r\\namongst his friends for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                (Wheeler and Bursal wink at one another.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  We know nothing of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have not the honour, sir, to be one of Mr. Talbot\\'s friends.\\r\\nIt is his own fault, and I am sorry for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, so am I, especially as it is mine--fault I mean; and\\r\\nespecially as the election is just going to come on.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a party of boys, who cry, Finsbury\\'s come!--Finsbury\\'s come with\\r\\nthe dresses!\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Finsbury\\'s come?  Oh, let us see the dresses, and let us try \\'em\\r\\non to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (pushing the crowd).  On with ye--on with ye, there!--Let\\'s try \\'em\\r\\non!--Try \\'em on--I\\'m to be colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\nlst Boy.  And I lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Boy.  And I ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd Boy.  And I college salt-bearer.\\r\\n\\r\\n4th Boy.  And I oppidan.\\r\\n\\r\\n5th Boy.  Oh, what a pity I\\'m in mourning.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Several speak at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are servitors.  We are to be the eight servitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And I am to be your Captain, I hope.  Come on, my Colonel.  (To\\r\\nBursal).  My lord, you are coming?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  By-and-by--I\\'ve a word in his ear, by your LAVE and his.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Why, what the devil stops the way, there?--Push on--on with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n6th Boy.  I\\'m marshal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  On with you--on with you--who cares what you are?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (to Bursal, aside).  You\\'ll pay Finsbury for me, you rich Jew?\\r\\n(To Lord John.)  Your lordship will remember your lordship\\'s promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I do not usually forget my promises, sir; and therefore need not\\r\\nto be reminded of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I beg pardon--I beg ten thousand pardons, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (taking him by the arm).  Come on, man, and don\\'t stand begging\\r\\npardon there, or I\\'ll leave you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (to Burs.) I beg pardon, Bursal--I beg pardon, ten thousand times.\\r\\n(Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n               Manent LORD JOHN and RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Wheugh!--Now put the case.  If I was going to be hanged, for the\\r\\nlife of me I couldn\\'t be after begging so many pardons for nothing at\\r\\nall.  But many men, many minds--(Hums.)  True game to the last!  No\\r\\nWheeler for me.  Oh, murder! I forgot, I was nigh letting the cat out o\\'\\r\\nthe bag again.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You had something to say to me, sir?  I wait till your\\r\\nrecollection returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, and that\\'s very kind of you; and if you had always done\\r\\nso, you would never have been offended with me, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You are mistaken, Mr. O\\'Ryan, if you think that you did or could\\r\\noffend me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Mistaken was I, then, sure enough; but we are all liable to\\r\\nmistakes, and should forget and forgive one another; that\\'s the way to go\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You will go through the world your own way, Mr. O\\'Ryan, and\\r\\nallow me to go through it my way.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Very fair--fair enough--then we shan\\'t cross.  But now, to come to\\r\\nthe point.  I don\\'t like to be making disagreeable retrospects, if I\\r\\ncould any way avoid it; nor to be going about the bush, especially at\\r\\nthis time o\\' day; when, as Mr. Finsbury\\'s come, we\\'ve not so much time to\\r\\nlose as we had.  Is there any truth, then, my lord, in the report that is\\r\\ngoing about this hour past, that you have gone in a huff, and given your\\r\\npromise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him now?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  In answer to your question, sir, I am to inform you that I HAVE\\r\\npromised Mr. Wheeler to vote for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  In a huff?--Ay, now, there it is!--Well, when a man\\'s MAD, to be\\r\\nsure, he\\'s mad--and that\\'s all that can be said about it.  And I know, if\\r\\nI had been MAD myself, I might have done a foolish thing as well as\\r\\nanother.  But now, my lord, that you are not mad--\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I protest, sir, I cannot understand you.  In one word, sir, I\\'m\\r\\nneither mad nor a fool!--Your most obedient (going, angrily).\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (holding him).  Take care now; you are going mad with me again.  But\\r\\nphoo! I like you the better for being mad.  I\\'m very often mad myself,\\r\\nand I would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  He\\'ll not be quiet, till he makes me knock him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Agh! agh! agh!--I begin to guess whereabouts I am at last.  MAD,\\r\\nin your country, I take it, means fit for Bedlam; but with us in Ireland,\\r\\nnow, \\'tis no such thing; it mean\\'s nothing in life but the being in a\\r\\npassion.  Well, one comfort is, my lord, as you\\'re a bit of a scholar, we\\r\\nhave the Latin proverb in our favour--\"Ira furor brevis est\"  (Anger is\\r\\nshort madness).  The shorter the better, I think.  So, my lord, to put an\\r\\nend to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor Talbot, I\\'ll\\r\\nassure you he\\'s as innocent o\\' that unfortunate song as the babe unborn.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  It is rather late for Mr. Talbot to make apologies to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  He make apologies!  Not he, \\'faith; he\\'d send me to Coventry, or,\\r\\nmaybe, to a worse place, did he but know I was condescending to make this\\r\\nbit of explanation, unknown to him.  But, upon my conscience, I\\'ve a\\r\\nregard for you both, and don\\'t like to see you go together by the ears.\\r\\nNow, look you, my lord.  By this book, and all the books that were ever\\r\\nshut and opened, he never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till\\r\\nI came out with it this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  For that I take shame to myself, as it turned out; but it was only\\r\\na WHITE lie to SARVE a friend, and make him cut a dash with a new song at\\r\\nelection time.  But I\\'ve done for ever with white lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (walking about as if agitated).  I wish you had never begun with\\r\\nthem, Mr. O\\'Ryan.  This may be a good joke to you; but it is none to me\\r\\nor Talbot.  So Talbot never wrote a word of the song?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Not a word or syllable, good or bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  And I have given my promise to vote against him.  He\\'ll lose his\\r\\nelection.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Not if you\\'ll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have promised to leave them to themselves; and Wheeler, I am\\r\\nsure, has engaged them by this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Bless my body!  I\\'ll not stay prating here then.\\r\\n                                               (Exit Rory.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (follows).  But what can have become of Talbot?  I have been too\\r\\nhasty for once in my life.  Well, I shall suffer for it more than anybody\\r\\nelse; for I love Talbot, since he did not make the song, of which I hate\\r\\nto think.                        (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large hall in Eton College--A staircase at the end--Eton lads, dressed\\r\\nin their Montem Dresses in the Scene--In front, WHEELER (dressed as\\r\\nCaptain), BURSAL and FINSBURY.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  I give you infinite credit, Mr. Wheeler, for this dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  INFINITE CREDIT!  Why, he\\'ll have no objection to that--hey,\\r\\nWheeler?  But I thought Finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  You are pleased to be pleasant, sir.  Mr. Wheeler knows, in that\\r\\nsense of the word, it is out of my power to give him credit, and I\\'m sure\\r\\nhe would not ask it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  O, Bursal, pay him, and I\\'ll pay you tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Now, if you weren\\'t to be captain after all, Wheeler, what a\\r\\npretty figure you\\'d cut.  Ha! ha! ha!--Hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Oh, I am as sure of being captain as of being alive.  (Aside.) Do\\r\\npay for me, now, there\\'s a good, dear fellow, before THEY (looking back)\\r\\ncome up.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  I love to make him lick the dust.  (Aloud.)  Hollo!\\r\\nhere\\'s Finsbury waiting to be paid, lads.  (To the lads who are in the\\r\\nback scene.)  Who has paid, and who has not paid, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\n(The lads come forward, and several exclaim at once,) I\\'ve paid!  I\\'ve\\r\\npaid!\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter LORD JOHN and RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, King of Fashion, how fine we are!  Why, now, to look at ye all\\r\\none might fancy one\\'s self at the playhouse at once, or at a fancy ball\\r\\nin dear little Dublin.  Come, strike up a dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Pshaw!  Wherever you come, Rory O\\'Ryan, no one else can be heard.\\r\\nWho has paid, and who has not paid, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Boys exclaim.  We\\'ve all paid.\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Boy.  I\\'ve not paid, but here\\'s my money.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Boys.  We have not paid, but here\\'s our money.\\r\\n\\r\\n6th Boy.  Order there, I am marshal.  All that have paid march off to the\\r\\nstaircase, and take your seats there, one by one.  March!\\r\\n\\r\\n(As they march by, one by one, so as to display their dresses, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury bows, and says,)\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand thanks, gentlemen.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thanks, gentlemen.\\r\\nThe finest sight ever I saw out of Lon\\'on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory, as each lad passes, catches his arm, Are you a TalbotITE or a\\r\\nWheelerITE?  To each who answers \"A Wheelerite,\" Rory replies, \"Phoo!\\r\\ndance off, then.  Go to the devil and shake yourself.\"*   Each who\\r\\nanswers \"A Talbotite,\" Rory shakes by the hand violently, singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Talbot, oh, Talbot\\'s the dog for Rory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is the name of a country dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they have almost all passed, Lord John says, But where can Mr.\\r\\nTalbot be all this time?\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Who knows?  Who cares?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  A pretty electioneerer!  (Aside to Bursal.)  Finsbury\\'s waiting\\r\\nto be paid.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You don\\'t wait for me, Mr. Finsbury.  You know, I have settled\\r\\nwith you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  Yes, my lord--yes.  Many thanks:  and I have left your lordship\\'s\\r\\ndress here, and everybody\\'s dress, I believe, as bespoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Here, Finsbury, is the money for Wheeler, who, between you and me,\\r\\nis as poor as a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler (affecting to laugh.).  Well, I hope I shall be as rich as a Jew\\r\\nto-morrow.  (Bursal counts money, in an ostentatious manner, into\\r\\nFinsbury\\'s hand.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  A thousand thanks for all favours.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  You will be kind enough to LAVE Mr. Talbot\\'s dress with me, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, for I\\'m a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  Indubitably, sir:  but the misfortune is--he! he! he!--Mr. Talbot,\\r\\nsir, has bespoke no dress.  Your servant, gentlemen.\\r\\n                                           (Exit Finsbury.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  So your friend Mr. Talbot could not afford to bespeak a dress--\\r\\n(Bursal and Wheeler laugh insolently.)  How comes that, I wonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  If I\\'m not mistaken, here comes Talbot to answer for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But who, in the name of St. Patrick, has he along with him?\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter TALBOT and LANDLORD.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Come in along with us, Farmer Hearty--come in.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Whilst the Farmer comes in, the boys who were sitting on the stairs,\\r\\nrise and exclaim,)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom have we here?  What now?  Come down, lads; here\\'s more fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  What\\'s here, Talbot?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  An honest farmer, and a good natured landlord, who would come here\\r\\nalong with me to speak--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm. (interrupting).  To speak the truth--(strikes his stick on the\\r\\nground).\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (unbuttoning his waistcoat).  But I am so hot--so short-winded,\\r\\nthat (panting and puffing)--that for the soul and body of me, I cannot\\r\\nsay what I have got for to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, now, the more short winded a story, the better, to my\\r\\nfancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Wheeler, what\\'s the matter, man? you look as if your under jaw was\\r\\nbroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  The matter is, young gentlemen, that there was once upon a time a\\r\\nfine, bay hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (squeezing up to Talbot, aside).  Don\\'t expose me, don\\'t let him\\r\\ntell.  (To the Farmer.)  I\\'ll pay for the corn I spoiled.  (To the\\r\\nLandlord.)  I\\'ll pay for the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  I does not want to be paid for my corn.  The short of it is, young\\r\\ngentlemen, this \\'un here, in the fine thing-em-bobs (pointing to\\r\\nWheeler), is a shabby fellow; he went and spoiled Master Newington\\'s best\\r\\nhunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (panting).  Ruinationed him! ruinationed him!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But was that all the shabbiness?  Now I might, or any of us might,\\r\\nhave had such an accident as that.  I suppose he paid the gentleman for\\r\\nthe horse, or will do so, in good time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (holding his sides).  Oh, that I had but a little breath in this\\r\\nbody o\\' mine to speak all--speak on, Farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm. (striking his stick on the floor).  Oons, sir, when a man\\'s put\\r\\nout, he can\\'t go on with his story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmnes.  Be quiet, Rory--hush!     (Rory puts his finger on his lips.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Why, sir, I was a-going to tell you the shabbiness--why, sir, he\\r\\ndid not pay the landlord, here, for the horse; but he goes and says to\\r\\nthe landlord, here--\"Mr. Talbot had your horse on the self-same day;\\r\\n\\'twas he did the damage; \\'tis from he you must get your money.\"  So Mr.\\r\\nTalbot, here, who is another sort of a gentleman (though he has not so\\r\\nfine a coat) would not see a man at a loss, that could not afford it; and\\r\\nnot knowing which of \\'em it was that spoiled the horse, goes, when he\\r\\nfinds the other would not pay a farthing, and pays all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (rubbing his hands).  There\\'s Talbot for ye.  And, now, gentlemen\\r\\n(to Wheeler and Bursal), you guess the RASON, as I do, I suppose, why he\\r\\nbespoke no dress; he had not money enough to be fine--and honest, too.\\r\\nYou are very fine, Mr. Wheeler, to do you justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Pray, Mr. O\\'Ryan, let the farmer go on; he has more to say.  How\\r\\ndid you find out, pray, my good friend, that it was not Talbot who\\r\\nspoiled the horse!  Speak loud enough to be heard by everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I will--I say (very loudly) I say I saw him there\\r\\n(pointing to Wheeler) take the jump which strained the horse; and I\\'m\\r\\nready to swear to it.  Yet he let another pay; there\\'s the shabbiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n(A general groan from all the lads.  \"Oh, shabby Wheeler, shabby!  I\\'ll\\r\\nnot vote for shabby Wheeler!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  Alas! I must vote for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"True game to the last; no Wheeler for me;\\r\\n      Talbot, oh, Talbot\\'s the dog for me.\"\\r\\n                               (Several voices join the chorus.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Wheeler, if you are not chosen Captain, you must see and pay me\\r\\nfor the dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I am as poor as a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, yes! oh yes! hear ye! hear ye, all manner of men--the election\\r\\nis now going to begin forthwith in the big field, and Rory O\\'Ryan holds\\r\\nthe poll for Talbot.  Talbot for ever!--huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Exit Rory, followed by the Boys, who exclaim \"Talbot for ever!--huzza!\"\\r\\nThe Landlord and Farmer join them.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Talbot, I am glad you are what I always thought you--I\\'m glad\\r\\nyou did not write that odious song.  I would not lose such a friend for\\r\\nall the songs in the world.  Forgive me for my hastiness this morning.\\r\\nI\\'ve punished myself--I\\'ve promised to vote for Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, no matter whom you vote for, my lord, if you are still my\\r\\nfriend, and if you know me to be yours.      (They shake hands.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I must not say, \"Huzza for Talbot!\"        (Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         WINDSOR TERRACE.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY PIERCEFIELD, MRS. TALBOT, LOUISA, and a little girl of six years\\r\\nold, LADY VIOLETTA, daughter to LADY PIERCEFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nVioletta (looking at a paper which Louisa holds).  I like it VERY much.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  What is it that you like VERY much, Violetta?\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  You are not to know yet, mamma; it is--I may tell her that--it\\r\\nis a little drawing that Louisa is doing for me.  Louisa, I wish you\\r\\nwould let me show it to mamma.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  And welcome, my dear; it is only a sketch of \"The Little\\r\\nMerchants,\" a story which Violetta was reading, and she asked me to try\\r\\nto draw the pictures of the little merchants for her.  (Whilst Lady P.\\r\\nlooks at the drawing, Violetta says to Louisa)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut are you in earnest, Louisa, about what you were saying to me just\\r\\nnow,--quite in earnest?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Yes, in earnest,--quite in earnest, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  And may I ask mamma, NOW?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  If you please, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (runs to her mother).  Stoop down to me, mamma ; I\\'ve something\\r\\nto whisper to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lady Piercefield stoops down; Violetta throws her arms round her\\r\\nmother\\'s neck.)\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aside to her mother).  Mamma, do you know--you know you want a\\r\\ngoverness for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Yes, if I could find a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aloud).  Stoop again, mamma, I\\'ve more to whisper.  (Aside to\\r\\nher mother).  SHE says she will be my governess, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  SHE!--who is SHE?\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  Louisa.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P. (patting Violetta\\'s cheek).  You are a little fool.  Miss Talbot\\r\\nis only playing with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  No, indeed, mamma; she is in earnest; are not you, Louisa?--Oh,\\r\\nsay yes!\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (claps her hands).  YES, mamma; do you hear YES?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  If Lady Piercefield will trust you to my care, I am persuaded\\r\\nthat I should be much happier as your governess, my good little Violetta,\\r\\nthan as an humble dependent of Miss Bursal\\'s.  (Aside to her mother.)\\r\\nYou see that, now I am put to the trial, I keep to my resolution, dear\\r\\nmother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Your ladyship would not be surprised at this offer of my Louisa,\\r\\nif you had heard, as we have done within these few hours, of the loss of\\r\\nthe East India ship in which almost our whole property was embarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  The Bombay Castle is wrecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  The Bombay Castle!  I have the pleasure to tell you that you are\\r\\nmisinformed--it was the Airly Castle that was wrecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa and Mrs. T.  Indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Yes; you may depend upon it--it was the Airly Castle that was\\r\\nlost.  You know I am just come from Portsmouth, where I went to meet my\\r\\nbrother, Governor Morton, who came home with the last India fleet, and\\r\\nfrom whom I had the intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Here Violetta interrupts, to ask her mother for her nosegay--Lady P.\\r\\ngives it to her, then goes on speaking.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  They were in such haste, foolish people! to carry their news to\\r\\nLondon, that they mistook one castle for another.  But do you know that\\r\\nMr. Bursal loses fifty thousand pounds, it is said, by the Airly Castle!\\r\\nWhen I told him she was lost, I thought he would have dropped down.\\r\\nHowever, I found he comforted himself afterwards with a bottle of\\r\\nBurgundy:  but poor Miss Bursal has been in hysterics ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Poor girl!  My Louisa, YOU did not fall into hysterics, when I\\r\\ntold you of the loss of our whole fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Violetta, during this dialogue, has been seated on the ground making up\\r\\na nosegay.)\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aside).  Fall into hysterics!  What are hysterics, I wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Miss Bursal is much to be pitied; for the loss of wealth will be\\r\\nthe loss of happiness to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  It is to be hoped that the loss may at least check the foolish\\r\\npride and extravagance of young Bursal, who, as my son tells me--\\r\\n\\r\\n               (A cry of \"Huzza! huzza!\" behind the scenes.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter LORD JOHN.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  (hastily).  How d\\'ye do, mother!  Miss Talbot, I give you joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Take breath--take breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  It is my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Here he is!--Hark! hark!\\r\\n\\r\\n      (A cry behind the scenes of \"Talbot and truth for ever! Huzza!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  They are chairing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Yes, they are chairing him; and he has been chosen for his\\r\\nhonourable conduct, not for his electioneering skill; for, to do him\\r\\njustice, Coriolanus himself was not a worse electioneerer.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter RORY O\\'RYAN and another Eton lad, carrying TALBOT in a chair,\\r\\nfollowed by a crowd of Eton lads.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  By your LAVE, my lord--by your LAVE, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmnes.  Huzza!  Talbot and truth for ever!  Huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Set me down!  There\\'s my mother!  There\\'s my sister!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Easy, easy.  Set him down?  No such TING! give him t\\'other huzza!\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing like a good loud huzza in this world.  Yes, there is!\\r\\nfor, as my Lord John said just now, out of some book, or out of his own\\r\\nhead,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"One self-approving hour whole years outweighs,\\r\\n      Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           CURTAIN FALLS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFORGIVE AND FORGET.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of England, there\\r\\nlived a gardener, who had one son, called Maurice, to whom he was very\\r\\npartial.  One day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to\\r\\npurchase some garden seeds for him.  When Maurice got to the seed-shop,\\r\\nit was full of people, who were all impatient to be served:  first a\\r\\ngreat tall man, and next a great fat woman pushed before him; and he\\r\\nstood quietly beside the counter, waiting till somebody should be at\\r\\nleisure to attend to him.  At length, when all the other people who were\\r\\nin the shop had got what they wanted, the shopman turned to Maurice--\"And\\r\\nwhat do you want, my patient little fellow?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want all these seeds for my father,\" said Maurice, putting a list of\\r\\nseeds into the shopman\\'s hand; \"and I have brought money to pay for them\\r\\nall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seedsman looked out all the seeds that Maurice wanted, and packed\\r\\nthem up in paper:  he was folding up some painted lady-peas, when, from a\\r\\ndoor at the back of the shop, there came in a square, rough-faced man,\\r\\nwho exclaimed, the moment he came in, \"Are the seeds I ordered ready?--\\r\\nThe wind\\'s fair--they ought to have been aboard yesterday.  And my china\\r\\njar, is it packed up and directed? where is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is up there on the shelf over your head, sir,\" answered the seedsman.\\r\\n\"It is very safe, you see; but we have not had time to pack it yet.  It\\r\\nshall be done to-day; and we will get the seeds ready for you, sir,\\r\\nimmediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immediately! then stir about it.  The seeds will not pack themselves up.\\r\\nMake haste, pray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immediately, sir, as soon as I have done up the parcel for this little\\r\\nboy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What signifies the parcel for this little boy?  He can wait, and I\\r\\ncannot--wind and tide wait for no man.  Here, my good lad, take your\\r\\nparcel, and sheer off,\" said the impatient man; and, as he spoke, he took\\r\\nup the parcel of seeds from the counter, as the shopman stooped to look\\r\\nfor a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parcel was but loosely folded up, and as the impatient man lifted it,\\r\\nthe weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper, and\\r\\nall the seeds fell out upon the floor, whilst Maurice in vain held his\\r\\nhands to catch them.  The peas rolled to all parts of the shop; the\\r\\nimpatient man swore at them, but Maurice, without being out of humour,\\r\\nset about collecting them as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the boy was busied in this manner, the man got what seeds he\\r\\nwanted; and as he was talking about them, a sailor came into the shop,\\r\\nand said, \"Captain, the wind has changed within these five minutes, and\\r\\nit looks as if we should have ugly weather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad of it,\" replied the rough faced man, who was the captain\\r\\nof a ship.  \"I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore, and I\\'ve\\r\\nbusiness enough on my hands.\"  The captain pushed forward towards the\\r\\nshop door.  Maurice, who was kneeling on the floor, picking up his seeds,\\r\\nsaw that the captain\\'s foot was entangled in some packthread which hung\\r\\ndown from the shelf on which the china jar stood.  Maurice saw that, if\\r\\nthe captain took one more step forward, he must pull the string, so that\\r\\nit would throw down the jar, round the bottom of which the packthread was\\r\\nentangled.  He immediately caught hold of the captain\\'s leg, and stopped\\r\\nhim.  \"Stay!  Stand still, sir!\" said he, \"or you will break your china\\r\\njar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood still, looked, and saw how the packthread had caught in his\\r\\nshoe buckle, and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar.\\r\\n\"I am really very much obliged to you, my little fellow,\" said he.  \"You\\r\\nhave saved my jar, which I would not have broken for ten guineas, for it\\r\\nis for my wife, and I\\'ve brought it safe from abroad many a league.  It\\r\\nwould have been a pity if I had broken it just when it was safe landed.\\r\\nI am really much obliged to you, my little fellow, this was returning\\r\\ngood for evil.  I am sorry I threw down your seeds, as you are such a\\r\\ngood natured, forgiving boy.  Be so kind,\" continued he, turning to the\\r\\nshopman, \"as to reach down that china jar for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopman lifted down the jar very carefully, and the captain took off\\r\\nthe cover, and pulled out some tulip roots.  \"You seem, by the quantity\\r\\nof seeds you have got, to belong to a gardener.  Are you fond of\\r\\ngardening?\" said he to Maurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Maurice, \"very fond of it; for my father is a\\r\\ngardener, and he lets me help him at his work, and he has given me a\\r\\nlittle garden of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then here are a couple of tulip-roots for you; and if you take care of\\r\\nthem, I\\'ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in\\r\\nyour little garden.  These tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant,\\r\\nwho told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland.\\r\\nThey will prosper with you, I\\'m sure, wind and weather permitting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice thanked the gentleman, and returned home, eager to show his\\r\\nprecious tulip-roots to his father, and to a companion of his, the son of\\r\\na nurseryman, who lived near him.  Arthur was the name of the\\r\\nnurseryman\\'s son.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing Maurice did, after showing his tulip-roots to his father,\\r\\nwas to run to Arthur\\'s garden in search of him.  Their gardens were\\r\\nseparated only by a low wall of loose stones:  \"Arthur! Arthur! where are\\r\\nyou?  Are you in your garden!  I want you.\"  But Arthur made no answer,\\r\\nand did not, as usual, come running to meet his friend.  \"I know where\\r\\nyou are,\" continued Maurice, \"and I\\'m coming to you as fast as the\\r\\nraspberry-bushes will let me.  I have good news for you--something you\\'ll\\r\\nbe delighted to see, Arthur!--Ha!--but here is something that I am not\\r\\ndelighted to see, I am sure,\" said poor Maurice, who, when he had got\\r\\nthrough the raspberry-bushes, and had come in sight of his own garden,\\r\\nbeheld his bell-glass--his beloved bell-glass, under which his cucumbers\\r\\nwere grown so finely--his only bell-glass, broken to pieces!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry for it,\" said Arthur, who stood leaning upon his spade in his\\r\\nown garden; \"I am afraid you will be very angry with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, was it you, Arthur, broke my bell-glass!  Oh, how could you do so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall, and by accident a great\\r\\nlump of couch-grass, with stones hanging to the roots, fell upon your\\r\\nbell-glass, and broke it, as you see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice lifted up the lump of couch-grass, which had fallen through the\\r\\nbroken glass upon his cucumbers, and he looked at his cucumbers for a\\r\\nmoment in silence--\"Oh, my poor cucumbers! you must all die now.  I shall\\r\\nsee all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow; but it is done, and it\\r\\ncannot be helped; so, Arthur, let us say no more about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good; I thought you would have been angry.  I am sure I\\r\\nshould have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass, if it had\\r\\nbeen mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, forgive and forget, as my father always says; that\\'s the best way.\\r\\nLook what I have got for you.\"  Then he told Arthur the story of the\\r\\ncaptain of the ship, and the china jar; the seeds having been thrown\\r\\ndown, and of the fine tulip-roots which had been given to him; and\\r\\nMaurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to Arthur, who\\r\\nthanked him with great joy, and repeatedly said, \"How good you were not\\r\\nto be angry with me for breaking your bell-glass!  I am much more sorry\\r\\nfor it than if you had been in a passion with me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur now went to plant his tulip-root:  and Maurice looked at the beds\\r\\nwhich his companion had been digging, and at all the things which were\\r\\ncoming up in his garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know how it is,\" said Arthur, \"but you always seem as glad to\\r\\nsee the things in my garden coming up, and doing well, as if they were\\r\\nall your own.  I am much happier since my father came to live here, and\\r\\nsince you and I have been allowed to work and to play together, than I\\r\\never was before; for you must know, before we came to live here, I had a\\r\\ncousin in the house with me, who used to plague me.  He was not nearly so\\r\\ngood-natured as you are.  He never took pleasure in looking at my garden,\\r\\nor at anything that I did that was well done; and he never gave me a\\r\\nshare of anything that he had; and so I did not like him; how could I?\\r\\nBut, I believe that hating people makes us unhappy; for I know I never\\r\\nwas happy when I was quarrelling with him; and I am always happy with\\r\\nyou, Maurice.  You know we never quarrel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be well for all the world if they could be convinced, like\\r\\nArthur, that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel.  It would\\r\\nbe well for all the world if they followed Maurice\\'s maxim of \"Forgive\\r\\nand Forget,\" when they receive, or when they imagine that they receive,\\r\\nan injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur\\'s father, Mr. Oakly, the nurseryman, was apt to take offence at\\r\\ntrifles; and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him,\\r\\nhe was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct; therefore he was\\r\\noften mistaken in his judgment of them.  He thought that it showed\\r\\nSPIRIT, to remember and to resent an injury; and, therefore, though he\\r\\nwas not an ill-natured man, he was sometimes led, by this mistaken idea\\r\\nof SPIRIT, to do ill-natured things:  \"A warm friend and a bitter enemy,\"\\r\\nwas one of his maxims, and he had many more enemies than friends.  He was\\r\\nnot very rich, but he was proud; and his favourite proverb was, \"Better\\r\\nlive in spite than in pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first he settled near Mr. Grant, the gardener, he felt inclined to\\r\\ndislike him, because he was told that Mr. Grant was a Scotchman, and he\\r\\nhad a prejudice against Scotchmen; all of whom he believed to be cunning\\r\\nand avaricious, because he had once been over-reached by a Scotch\\r\\npeddler.  Grant\\'s friendly manners in some degree conquered this\\r\\nprepossession but still he secretly suspected that THIS CIVILITY, as he\\r\\nsaid, \"was all show, and that he was not, nor could not, being a\\r\\nScotchman, be such a hearty friend as a true-born Englishman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant had some remarkably fine raspberries.  The fruit was so large, as\\r\\nto be quite a curiosity.  When it was in season, many strangers came from\\r\\nthe neighbouring town, which was a sea-bathing place, to look at these\\r\\nraspberries, which obtained the name of Brobdingnag raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How came you, pray, neighbour Grant, if a man may ask, by these\\r\\nwonderful fine raspberries?\" said Mr. Oakly, one evening, to the\\r\\ngardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a secret,\" replied Grant, with an arch smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, in case it\\'s a secret, I\\'ve no more to say; for I never meddle with\\r\\nany man\\'s secrets that he does not choose to trust me with.  But I wish,\\r\\nneighbour Grant, you would put down that book.  You are always poring\\r\\nover some book or another when a man comes to see you, which is not,\\r\\naccording to my notions (being a plain, UNLARNED Englishman bred and\\r\\nborn), so civil and neighbourly as might be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Grant hastily shut his book, but remarked, with a shrewd glance at\\r\\nhis son, that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as\\r\\nbook-LARNED as yourself, Mr. Grant; but I take it, being only a plain\\r\\nspoken Englishman, as I observed afore, that one is to the full as like\\r\\nto find a raspberry in one\\'s garden as in one\\'s book, Mr. Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant, observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone, did not\\r\\ncontradict him; being well versed in the Bible, he knew that \"A soft word\\r\\nturneth away wrath,\" and he answered, in a good humoured voice, \"I hear,\\r\\nneighbour Oakly, you are likely to make a great deal of money of your\\r\\nnursery this year.  Here\\'s to the health of you and yours, not forgetting\\r\\nthe seedling larches, which I see are coming on finely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank ye, neighbour, kindly; the larches are coming on tolerably well,\\r\\nthat\\'s certain; and here\\'s to your good health, Mr. Grant--you and yours,\\r\\nnot forgetting your, what dye call \\'em raspberries\"--(drinks)--and, after\\r\\na pause, resumes, \"I\\'m not apt to be a beggar, neighbour, but if you\\r\\ncould give me--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers, and he\\r\\ndid finish making his request--Mr. Oakly was not, as he said of himself,\\r\\napt to ask favours, and nothing but Grant\\'s cordiality could have\\r\\nconquered his prejudices, so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a\\r\\nScotchman.  He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberry-plants.  The next day the thought of the raspberry-plants\\r\\nrecurred to his memory, but being a bashful man, he did not like to go\\r\\nhimself on purpose to make his request, and he desired his wife, who was\\r\\njust setting out to market, to call at Grant\\'s gate, and, if he was at\\r\\nwork in his garden, to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer which Oakly\\'s wife brought to him was that Mr. Grant had not a\\r\\nraspberry-plant in the world to give him, and that if he had ever so\\r\\nmany, he would not give one away, except to his own son.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly flew into a passion when he received such a message, declared it\\r\\nwas just such a mean, shabby trick as might have been expected from a\\r\\nScotchman--called himself a booby, a dupe, and a blockhead, for ever\\r\\nhaving trusted to the civil speeches of a Scotchman--swore that he would\\r\\ndie in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour, be\\r\\nit ever so small, from a Scotchman; related to his wife, for the\\r\\nhundredth time, the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch\\r\\npeddler ten years ago, and concluded by forswearing all further\\r\\nintercourse with Mr. Grant, and all belonging to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Son Arthur,\" said he, addressing himself to the boy, who just then came\\r\\nin from work--\"Son Arthur, do you hear me? let me never again see you\\r\\nwith Grant\\'s son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With Maurice, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With Maurice Grant, I say; I forbid you from this day and hour forward\\r\\nto have anything to do with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, why, dear father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask no questions but do as I bid you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur burst out a crying, and only said, \"Yes, father, I\\'ll do as you\\r\\nbid me, to be sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why now, what does the boy cry for?  Is there no other boy, simpleton,\\r\\nthink you, to play with, but this Scotchman\\'s son!  I\\'ll find out another\\r\\nplay-fellow for ye, child, if that be all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not all, father,\" said Arthur, trying to stop himself from\\r\\nsobbing; \"but the thing is, I shall never have such another play-fellow,-\\r\\n-I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like father like son--you may think yourself well off to have done with\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done with him!  Oh, father, and shall I never go again to work in his\\r\\ngarden, and may not he come to mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Oakly, sturdily; \"his father has used me uncivil, and no\\r\\nman shall use me uncivil twice.  I say no.  Wife, sweep up this hearth.\\r\\nBoy, don\\'t take on like a fool; but eat thy bacon and greens, and let\\'s\\r\\nhear no more of Maurice Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur promised to obey his father.  He only begged that he might once\\r\\nmore speak to Maurice, and tell him that it was by his father\\'s orders he\\r\\nacted.  This request was granted; but when Arthur further begged to know\\r\\nwhat reason he might give for this separation, his father refused to tell\\r\\nhis reasons.  The two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Grant, when he heard of all this, endeavoured to discover what could\\r\\nhave offended his neighbour; but all explanation was prevented by the\\r\\nobstinate silence of Oakly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr. Oakly received.\\r\\nThe message was, that the raspberries were not Mr. Grant\\'s; that\\r\\ntherefore he had no right to give them away; that they belonged to his\\r\\nson Maurice, and that this was not the right time of year for planting\\r\\nthem.  This message had been unluckily misunderstood.  Grant gave his\\r\\nanswer to his wife; she to a Welsh servant-girl, who did not perfectly\\r\\ncomprehend her mistress\\' broad Scotch; and she in her turn could not make\\r\\nherself intelligible to Mrs. Oakly, who hated the Welsh accent, and whose\\r\\nattention, when the servant-girl delivered the message, was principally\\r\\nengrossed by the management of her own horse.  The horse, on which Mrs.\\r\\nOakly rode this day being ill-broken, would not stand still quietly at\\r\\nthe gate, and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer, and to\\r\\nride on to market.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly, when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour Grant, could\\r\\nnot long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint.  There was\\r\\nin Grant\\'s garden a plum-tree, which was planted close to the loose stone\\r\\nwall that divided the garden from the nursery.  The soil in which the\\r\\nplum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was\\r\\non the opposite side of the wall, and the plum-tree had forced its way\\r\\nthrough the wall, and gradually had taken possession of the ground which\\r\\nit liked best.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly thought the plum-tree, as it belonged to Mr. Grant, had no right to\\r\\nmake its appearance on his ground:  an attorney told him that he might\\r\\noblige Grant to cut it down; but Mr. Grant refused to cut down his plum-\\r\\ntree at the attorney\\'s desire, and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to\\r\\nlaw about the business, and the lawsuit went on for some months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney, at the end of this time, came to Oakly with a demand for\\r\\nmoney to carry on his suit, assuring him that, in a short time, it would\\r\\nbe determined in his favour.  Oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas,\\r\\nremarked that it was a great sum for him to pay, and that nothing but the\\r\\nlove of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of\\r\\nground, \"which, after all,\" said he, \"is not worth twopence.  The plum-\\r\\ntree does me little or no damage, but I don\\'t like to be imposed upon by\\r\\na Scotchman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly\\'s prejudice against the\\r\\nnatives of Scotland; and he persuaded him, that to show the SPIRIT of a\\r\\ntrue-born Englishman it was necessary, whatever it might cost him, to\\r\\npersist in this law suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon after this conversation with the attorney that Mr. Oakly\\r\\nwalked, with resolute steps, towards the plum-tree, saying to himself,\\r\\n\"If it cost me a hundred pounds I will not let this cunning Scotchman get\\r\\nthe better of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur interrupted his father\\'s reverie, by pointing to a book and some\\r\\nyoung plants which lay upon the wall.  \"I fancy, father,\" said he, \"those\\r\\nthings are for you, for there is a little note directed to you, in\\r\\nMaurice\\'s handwriting.  Shall I bring it to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, let me read it, child, since I must.\"  It contained these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MR. OAKLY,--I don\\'t know why you have quarrelled with us; I am very\\r\\nsorry for it.  But though you are angry with me, I am not angry with you.\\r\\nI hope you will not refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, which\\r\\nyou asked for a great while ago, when we were all good friends.  It was\\r\\nnot the right time of the year to plant them, which was the reason they\\r\\nwere not sent to you; but it is just the right time to plant them now;\\r\\nand I send you the book, in which you will find the reason why we always\\r\\nput seaweed ashes about their roots; and I have got some seaweed ashes\\r\\nfor you.  You will find the ashes in the flower-pot upon the wall.  I\\r\\nhave never spoken to Arthur, nor he to me, since you bid us not.  So,\\r\\nwishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours, and\\r\\nlonging to be all friends again, I am, with love to dear Arthur and self,\\r\\n                     \"Your affectionate neighbour\\'s son,\\r\\n                                              \"MAURICE GRANT.\\r\\n\"P.S.--It is now about four months since the quarrel began, and that is a\\r\\nvery long while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly, because he\\r\\nwas not very expert in reading writing, and it cost him much trouble to\\r\\nspell it and put it together.  However, he seemed affected by it, and\\r\\nsaid, \"I believe this Maurice loves you well enough, Arthur, and he seems\\r\\na good sort of boy; but as to the raspberries, I believe all that he says\\r\\nabout them is but an excuse; and, at anyrate, as I could not get \\'em when\\r\\nI asked for them, I\\'ll not have \\'em now.  Do you hear me, I say, Arthur?\\r\\nWhat are you reading there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book, which\\r\\nMaurice had left along with the raspberry-plants upon the wall.  Arthur\\r\\nread aloud as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n               (Monthly Magazine, Dec. \\'98, p. 421.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey, which is almost\\r\\ncovered with seaweed in the winter, in like manner as many plants in\\r\\nEngland are with litter from the stable.  These strawberries are usually\\r\\nof the largeness of a middle-sized apricot, and the flavour is\\r\\nparticularly grateful.  In Jersey and Guernsey, situate scarcely one\\r\\ndegree farther south than Cornwall, all kinds of fruit, pulse, and\\r\\nvegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks\\r\\nsooner than in England, even on the southern shores; and snow will\\r\\nscarcely remain twenty-four hours on the earth.  Although this may be\\r\\nattributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt, and\\r\\nconsequently a moist atmosphere, yet the ashes (seaweed ashes) made use\\r\\nof as manure, may also have their portion of influence.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually\\r\\ntried upon raspberry-plants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here,\" continued Arthur, \"is something written with a pencil, on a\\r\\nslip of paper, and it is Maurice\\'s writing.  I will read it to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as\\r\\nlarge as apricots, after they had been covered over with seaweed, I\\r\\nthought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father\\'s\\r\\nraspberries; and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them.  He\\r\\ngave me leave, and I went directly and gathered together some seaweed\\r\\nthat had been cast on shore; and I dried it, and burned it, and then I\\r\\nmanured the raspberries with it, and the year afterwards the raspberries\\r\\ngrew to the size that you have seen.  Now, the reason I tell you this is,\\r\\nfirst, that you may know how to manage your raspberries, and next,\\r\\nbecause I remember you looked very grave, as if you were not pleased with\\r\\nmy father, Mr. Grant, when he told you that the way by which he came by\\r\\nhis Brobdingnag raspberries was a secret.  Perhaps this was the thing\\r\\nthat has made you so angry with us all; for you never have come to see\\r\\nfather since that evening.  Now I have told you all I know; and so I hope\\r\\nyou will not be angry with us any longer.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Oakly was much pleased by this openness, and said, \"Why now, Arthur,\\r\\nthis is something like, this is telling one the thing one wants to know,\\r\\nwithout fine speeches.  This is like an Englishman more than a Scotchman.\\r\\nPray, Arthur, do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in England\\r\\nor in Scotland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, sir, I don\\'t know--I never asked--I did not think it\\r\\nsignified.  All I know is, that wherever he was born, he is VERY good.\\r\\nLook, papa, my tulip is blowing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said his father, \"this will be a beautiful tulip!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was given to me by Maurice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you give him nothing for it?\" was the father\\'s inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing in the world; and he gave it to me just at the time when he had\\r\\ngood cause to be angry with me, just when I had broken his bell-glass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a great mind to let you play together again,\" said Arthur\\'s\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if you would,\" cried Arthur, clapping his hands, \"how happy we\\r\\nshould be!  Do you know, father, I have often sat for an hour at a time\\r\\nup in that crab-tree, looking at Maurice at work in his garden, and\\r\\nwishing that I was at work with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Arthur was interrupted by the attorney, who came to ask Mr. Oakly\\r\\nsome question about the lawsuit concerning the plum-tree.  Oakly showed\\r\\nhim Maurice\\'s letter; and to Arthur\\'s extreme astonishment, the attorney\\r\\nhad no sooner read it, than he exclaimed, \"What an artful little\\r\\ngentleman this is!  I never, in the course of all my practice, met with\\r\\nanything better.  Why, this is the most cunning letter I ever read.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s the cunning?\" said Oakly, and he put on his spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good sir, don\\'t you see, that all this stuff about Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum-tree?  They know--\\r\\nthat is, Mr. Grant, who is sharp enough, knows--that he will be worsted\\r\\nin that suit; that he must, in short, pay you a good round sum for\\r\\ndamages, if it goes on--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damages!\" said Oakly, staring round him at the plum-tree; \"but I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what you mean.  I mean nothing but what\\'s honest.  I don\\'t mean to\\r\\nask for any good round sum; for the plum-tree has done me no great harm\\r\\nby coming into my garden; but only I don\\'t choose it should come there\\r\\nwithout my leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said the attorney, \"I understand all that; but what I want\\r\\nto make you, Mr. Oakly, understand, is, that this Grant and his son only\\r\\nwant to make up matters with you, and prevent the thing\\'s coming to a\\r\\nfair trial, by sending on, in this underhand sort of way, a bribe of a\\r\\nfew raspberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bribe!\" exclaimed Oakly, \"I never took a bribe, and I never will\";\\r\\nand, with sudden indignation, he pulled the raspberry plants from the\\r\\nground in which Arthur was planting them; and he threw them over the wall\\r\\ninto Grant\\'s garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice had put his tulip, which was beginning to blow, in a flower-pot,\\r\\non the top of the wall, in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from\\r\\nday to day.  Alas! he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had\\r\\nplaced it.  One of his own Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, swung by the\\r\\nangry arm of Oakly, struck off the head of his precious tulip!  Arthur,\\r\\nwho was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney\\r\\nwas mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice, did not observe the fall of\\r\\nthe tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, when Maurice saw his raspberry-plants scattered upon the\\r\\nground, and his favourite tulip broken, he was in much astonishment, and,\\r\\nfor some moments, angry; but anger, with him, never lasted long.  He was\\r\\nconvinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake.  He\\r\\ncould not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on\\r\\npurpose--\"And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"the best thing I can do, is, not to let it vex me.  Forgive and\\r\\nforget.\"  This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he\\r\\ncould have been made, without it, by the possession of all the tulips in\\r\\nHolland.\\r\\n\\r\\nTulips were, at this time, things of great consequence in the estimation\\r\\nof the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived.  There\\r\\nwas a florist\\'s feast to be held at the neighbouring town, at which a\\r\\nprize of a handsome set of gardening-tools was to be given to the person\\r\\nwho could produce the finest flower of its kind.  A tulip was the flower\\r\\nwhich was thought the finest the preceding year, and consequently numbers\\r\\nof people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip-roots, in hopes of\\r\\nobtaining the prize this year.  Arthur\\'s tulip was beautiful.  As he\\r\\nexamined it from day to day, and every day thought it improving, he\\r\\nlonged to thank his friend Maurice for it; and he often mounted into his\\r\\ncrab-tree, to look into Maurice\\'s garden, in hopes of seeing his tulip\\r\\nalso in full bloom and beauty.  He never could see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of the florist\\'s feast arrived, and Oakly went with his son and\\r\\nthe fine tulip to the place of meeting.  It was on a spacious bowling-\\r\\ngreen.  All the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at\\r\\nthe upper end of the bowling-green; and, amongst all this gay variety,\\r\\nthe tulip which Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously\\r\\nbeautiful.  To the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged; and, as\\r\\nthe handsome garden-tools were delivered to Arthur, he heard a well known\\r\\nvoice wish him joy.  He turned, looked about him, and saw his friend\\r\\nMaurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Maurice, where is your own tulip?\" said Mr. Oakly; \"I thought,\\r\\nArthur, you told me that he kept one for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did,\" said Maurice; \"but somebody (I suppose by accident) broke\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Somebody! who?\" cried Arthur and Mr. Oakly at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Somebody who threw the raspberry-plants back again over the wall,\"\\r\\nreplied Maurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was me--that somebody was me,\" said Oakly.  \"I scorn to deny it;\\r\\nbut I did not intend to break your tulip, Maurice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Maurice,\" said Arthur--\"you know I may call him dear Maurice--now\\r\\nyou are by, papa; here are all the garden-tools; take them, and welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one of them,\" said Maurice, drawing back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Offer them to the father--offer them to Mr. Grant,\" whispered Oakly;\\r\\n\"he\\'ll take them, I\\'ll answer for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Oakly was mistaken:  the father would not accept of the tools.  Mr.\\r\\nOakly stood surprised--\"Certainly,\" said he to himself, \"this cannot be\\r\\nsuch a miser as I took him for\"; and he walked immediately up to Grant,\\r\\nand bluntly said to him, \"Mr. Grant, your son has behaved very handsomely\\r\\nto my son; and you seem to be glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I am,\" said Grant\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which,\" continued Oakly, \"gives me a better opinion of you than ever I\\r\\nhad before--I mean, than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby\\r\\nanswer about those foolish, what d\\'ye call em, cursed raspberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shabby answer?\" said Grant, with surprise; and Oakly repeated\\r\\nexactly the message which he received; and Grant declared that he never\\r\\nsent any such message.  He repeated exactly the answer which he really\\r\\nsent, and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him, saying \"I\\r\\nbelieve you:  no more need be said.  I\\'m only sorry I did not ask you\\r\\nabout this four months ago; and so I should have done if you had not been\\r\\na Scotchman.  Till now, I never rightly liked a Scotchman.  We may thank\\r\\nthis good little fellow,\" continued he, turning to Maurice, \"for our\\r\\ncoming at last to a right understanding.  There was no holding out\\r\\nagainst his good nature.  I\\'m sure, from the bottom of my heart, I\\'m\\r\\nsorry I broke his tulip.  Shake hands, boys; I\\'m glad to see you, Arthur,\\r\\nlook so happy again, and hope Mr. Grant will forgive--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, forgive and forget,\" said Grant and his son at the same moment.  And\\r\\nfrom this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly laughed at his own folly, in having been persuaded to go to law\\r\\nabout the plum-tree; and he, in process of time, so completely conquered\\r\\nhis early prejudice against Scotchmen, that he and Grant became partners\\r\\nin business.  Mr. Grant\\'s book-LARNING and knowledge of arithmetic he\\r\\nfound highly useful to him; and he, on his side, possessed a great many\\r\\nactive, good qualities, which became serviceable to his partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boys rejoiced in this family union; and Arthur often declared\\r\\nthat they owed all their happiness to Maurice\\'s favourite maxim, \"Forgive\\r\\nand Forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWASTE NOT, WANT NOT; or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham, a Bristol merchant, who had, by honourable industry and\\r\\neconomy, accumulated a considerable fortune, retired from business to a\\r\\nnew house which he had built upon the Downs, near Clifton.  Mr. Gresham,\\r\\nhowever, did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy.  He\\r\\ndid not propose to live in idleness and extravagance; for such a life\\r\\nwould have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles.\\r\\nHe was fond of children; and as he had no sons, he determined to adopt\\r\\none of his relations.  He had two nephews, and he invited both of them to\\r\\nhis house, that he might have an opportunity of judging of their\\r\\ndispositions, and of the habits which they had acquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal and Benjamin, Mr. Gresham\\'s nephews, were about ten years old.  They\\r\\nhad been educated very differently.  Hal was the son of the elder branch\\r\\nof the family.  His father was a gentleman, who spent rather more than he\\r\\ncould afford; and Hal, from the example of the servants in his father\\'s\\r\\nfamily, with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood, learned\\r\\nto waste more of everything than he used.  He had been told that\\r\\n\"gentlemen should be above being careful and saving\":  and he had\\r\\nunfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a\\r\\ngenerous disposition, and economy of an avaricious one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin, on the contrary, had been taught habits of care and foresight.\\r\\nHis father had but a very small fortune, and was anxious that his son\\r\\nshould early learn that economy ensures independence, and sometimes puts\\r\\nit in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle\\'s they were eager\\r\\nto see all the rooms in the house.  Mr. Gresham accompanied them, and\\r\\nattended to their remarks and exclamations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! what an excellent motto!\" exclaimed Ben, when he read the following\\r\\nwords, which were written in large characters over the chimney-piece, in\\r\\nhis uncle\\'s spacious kitchen--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"WASTE NOT, WANT NOT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Waste not, want not!\\'\" repeated his cousin Hal, in rather a\\r\\ncontemptuous tone; \"I think it looks stingy to servants; and no\\r\\ngentleman\\'s servants, cooks especially, would like to have such a mean\\r\\nmotto always staring them in the face.\"  Ben, who was not so conversant\\r\\nas his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemen\\'s servants, made no\\r\\nreply to these observations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other\\r\\nrooms in the house.  Some time afterwards, he heard their voices in the\\r\\nhall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"what are you doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Hal; \"you were called away from us and we did not\\r\\nknow which way to go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you nothing to do?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, nothing,\" answered Hal, in a careless tone, like one who was\\r\\nwell content with the state of habitual idleness.  \"No, sir, nothing!\"\\r\\nreplied Ben, in a voice of lamentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"if you have nothing to do, lads, will you\\r\\nunpack those two parcels for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good\\r\\nwhip cord.  Ben took his parcel to a table, and, after breaking off the\\r\\nsealing wax, began carefully to examine the knot, and then to untie it.\\r\\nHal stood still, exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his\\r\\nhands, and tried first at one corner, and then at another, to pull the\\r\\nstring off by force.  \"I wish these people wouldn\\'t tie up their parcels\\r\\nso tight, as if they were never to be undone,\" cried he, as he tugged at\\r\\nthe cord; and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben! why, how did you get yours undone, man? what\\'s in your parcel?--I\\r\\nwonder what is in mine!  I wish I could get this string off--I must cut\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ben, who now had undone the last knot of his parcel, and\\r\\nwho drew out the length of string with exultation, \"don\\'t cut it, Hal,--\\r\\nlook what a nice cord this is, and yours is the same:  it\\'s a pity to cut\\r\\nit; \\'WASTE NOT, WANT NOT!\\' you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!\" said Hal, \"what signifies a bit of packthread?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is whip cord,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, whip cord! what signifies a bit of whip cord! you can get a bit of\\r\\nwhip cord twice as long as that for twopence; and who cares for twopence!\\r\\nNot I, for one! so here it goes,\" cried Hal, drawing out his knife; and\\r\\nhe cut the cord, precipitately, in sundry places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lads! have you undone the parcels for me?\" said Mr. Gresham, opening the\\r\\nparlour door as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" cried Hal; and he dragged off his half cut, half entangled\\r\\nstring--\"here\\'s the parcel.\"  \"And here\\'s my parcel, uncle; and here\\'s\\r\\nthe string,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may keep the string for your pains,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben:  \"what an excellent whip cord it is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Hal,\" continued Mr. Gresham, \"you may keep your string too, if\\r\\nit will be of any use to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir,\" said Hal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I am afraid not, if this be it,\" said his uncle, taking up the\\r\\njagged knotted remains of Hal\\'s cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after this, Mr. Gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how\\'s this?\" said Hal; \"these tops have no strings; what shall we do\\r\\nfor strings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a string that will do very well for mine,\" said Ben; and he\\r\\npulled out of his pocket the fine, long, smooth string, which had tied up\\r\\nthe parcel.  With this he soon set up his top, which spun admirably well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, how I wish I had but a string,\" said Hal.  \"What shall I do for a\\r\\nstring?  I\\'ll tell you what, I can use the string that goes round my\\r\\nhat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then,\" said Ben, \"what will you do for a hat-band?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll manage to do without one,\" said Hal, and he took the string of his\\r\\nhat for his top.  It soon was worn through, and he split his top by\\r\\ndriving the pea too tightly into it.  His cousin Ben let him set up his\\r\\nthe next day; but Hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he\\r\\nmeddled with other people\\'s things than when he managed his own.  He had\\r\\nscarcely played half an hour before he split it, by driving the peg too\\r\\nviolently.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen bore this misfortune with good humour.  \"Come,\" said he, \"it can\\'t be\\r\\nhelped; but give me the string because THAT may still be of use for\\r\\nsomething else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened some time afterwards that a lady, who had been intimately\\r\\nacquainted with Hal\\'s mother at Bath--that is to say, who had frequently\\r\\nmet her at the card-table during the winter--now arrived at Clifton.  She\\r\\nwas informed by his mother that Hal was at Mr. Gresham\\'s, and her sons,\\r\\nwho were FRIENDS of his, came to see him, and invited him to spend the\\r\\nnext day with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal joyfully accepted the invitation.  He was always glad to go out to\\r\\ndine, because it gave him something to do, something to think of, or at\\r\\nleast something to say.  Besides this, he had been educated to think it\\r\\nwas a fine thing to visit fine people; and Lady Diana Sweepstakes (for\\r\\nthat was the name of his mother\\'s acquaintance) was a very fine lady, and\\r\\nher two sons intended to be very great gentlemen.  He was in a prodigious\\r\\nhurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle\\'s door the next\\r\\nday; but just as he got to the hall door, little Patty called to him from\\r\\nthe top of the stairs, and told him that he had dropped his pocket-\\r\\nhandkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pick it up, then, and bring it to me, quick, can\\'t you, child,\" cried\\r\\nHal, \"for Lady Di\\'s sons are waiting for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Patty did not know anything about Lady Di\\'s sons; but as she was\\r\\nvery good-natured, and saw that her cousin Hal was, for some reason or\\r\\nother, in a desperate hurry, she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly\\r\\ncould towards the landing-place, where the handkerchief lay; but, alas!\\r\\nbefore she reached the handkerchief, she fell, rolling down a whole\\r\\nflight of stairs, and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing-\\r\\nplace, she did not cry out, she writhed, as if she was in great pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you hurt, my love?\" said Mr. Gresham, who came instantly, on\\r\\nhearing the noise of someone falling downstairs.  \"Where are you hurt, my\\r\\ndear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, papa,\" said the little girl, touching her ankle, which she had\\r\\ndecently covered with her gown.  \"I believe I am hurt here, but not\\r\\nmuch,\" added she, trying to rise; \"only it hurts me when I move.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll carry you; don\\'t move then,\" said her father, and he took her up in\\r\\nhis arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My shoe!  I\\'ve lost one of my shoes,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen looked for it upon the stairs, and he found it sticking in a loop of\\r\\nwhip cord, which was entangled round one of the bannisters.  When this\\r\\ncord was drawn forth, it appeared that it was the very same jagged,\\r\\nentangled piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel.  He had diverted\\r\\nhimself with running up and downstairs, whipping the bannisters with it,\\r\\nas he thought he could convert it to no better use; and, with his usual\\r\\ncarelessness, he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw\\r\\nit when the dinner bell rang.  Poor little Patty\\'s ankle was terribly\\r\\nstrained, and Hal reproached himself for his folly, and would have\\r\\nreproached himself longer, perhaps, if Lady Di Sweepstakes\\' sons had not\\r\\nhurried him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, Patty could not run about as she used to do; but she sat\\r\\nupon the sofa, and she said, that she did not feel the pain of her ankle\\r\\nSO MUCH, whilst Ben was so good as to play at JACK STRAWS with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Ben; never be ashamed of being good-natured to those who\\r\\nare younger and weaker than yourself,\" said his uncle, smiling at seeing\\r\\nhim produce his whip cord, to indulge his little cousin with a game at\\r\\nher favourite cat\\'s cradle.  \"I shall not think you one bit less manly,\\r\\nbecause I see you playing at cat\\'s cradle with a little child of six\\r\\nyears old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, however, was not precisely of his uncle\\'s opinion:  for when he\\r\\nreturned in the evening, and saw Ben playing with his little cousin, he\\r\\ncould not help smiling contemptuously, and asked if he had been playing\\r\\nat cat\\'s cradle all night.  In a heedless manner he made some inquiries\\r\\nafter Patty\\'s sprained ankle, and then he ran on to tell all the news he\\r\\nhad heard at Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\'--news which he thought would make\\r\\nhim appear a person of vast importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, uncle--do you know, Ben,\" said he--\"there\\'s to be the most\\r\\nFAMOUS doings that ever were heard of upon the Downs here, the first day\\r\\nof next month, which will be in a fortnight, thank my stars!  I wish the\\r\\nfortnight was over; I shall think of nothing else, I know, till that\\r\\nhappy day comes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham inquired why the first of September was to be so much happier\\r\\nthan any other day in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" replied Hal, \"Lady Diana Sweepstakes, you know, is a famous rider,\\r\\nand archer, and ALL THAT--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely,\" said Mr. Gresham, soberly; \"but what then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear uncle!\" cried Hal, \"but you shall hear.  There\\'s to be a race upon\\r\\nthe Downs on the first of September, and after the race, there\\'s to be an\\r\\narchery meeting for the ladies, and Lady Diana Sweepstakes is to be one\\r\\nof THEM.  And after the ladies have done shooting--now, Ben, comes the\\r\\nbest part of it! we boys are to have our turn, and Lady Di is to give a\\r\\nprize to the best marksman amongst us, of a very handsome bow and arrow!\\r\\nDo you know, I\\'ve been practising already, and I\\'ll show you, to-morrow,\\r\\nas soon as it comes home, the FAMOUS bow and arrow that Lady Diana has\\r\\ngiven me; but, perhaps,\" added he, with a scornful laugh, \"you like a\\r\\ncat\\'s cradle better than a bow and arrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen made no reply to this taunt at the moment; but the next day, when\\r\\nHal\\'s new bow and arrow came home, he convinced him that he knew how to\\r\\nuse it very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben,\" said his uncle, \"you seem to be a good marksman, though you have\\r\\nnot boasted of yourself.  I\\'ll give you a bow and arrow, and, perhaps, if\\r\\nyou practise, you may make yourself an archer before the first of\\r\\nSeptember; and, in the meantime, you will not wish the fortnight to be\\r\\nover, for you will have something to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir,\" interrupted Hal, \"but if you mean that Ben should put in for\\r\\nthe prize, he must have a uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why MUST he?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir, because everybody has--I mean everybody that\\'s anybody; and\\r\\nLady Diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time, and it\\'s\\r\\nsettled, all about it, except the buttons:  the young Sweepstakes are to\\r\\nget theirs made first for patterns--they are to be white, faced with\\r\\ngreen, and they\\'ll look very handsome, I\\'m sure; and I shall write to\\r\\nmamma to-night, as Lady Diana bid me, about mine; and I shall tell her to\\r\\nbe sure to answer my letter, without fail, by return of post; and then,\\r\\nif mamma makes no objection, which I know she won\\'t, because she never\\r\\nthinks much about expense, and ALL THAT--then I shall bespeak my uniform,\\r\\nand get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady Diana and the\\r\\nyoung Sweepstakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mercy upon us!\" said Mr. Gresham, who was almost stunned by the rapid\\r\\nvociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t pretend to understand these things,\" added he, with an air of\\r\\nsimplicity; \"but we will inquire, Ben, into the necessity of the case;\\r\\nand if it is necessary--or, if you think it necessary, that you shall\\r\\nhave a uniform--why, I\\'ll give you one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU, uncle?  Will you, INDEED?\" exclaimed Hal, with amazement painted in\\r\\nhis countenance.  \"Well, that\\'s the last thing in the world I should have\\r\\nexpected!  You are not at all the sort of person I should have thought\\r\\nwould care about a uniform; and now I should have supposed you\\'d have\\r\\nthought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day; and\\r\\nI\\'m sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes thought as I do; for when I told her of\\r\\nthat motto over your kitchen chimney, \\'WASTE NOT, WANT NOT,\\' she laughed,\\r\\nand said that I had better not talk to you about uniforms, and that my\\r\\nmother was the proper person to write to about my uniform:  but I\\'ll tell\\r\\nLady Diana, uncle, how good you are, and how much she was mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care how you do that,\" said Mr. Gresham:  \"for perhaps the lady was\\r\\nnot mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, did not you say, just now, you would give poor Ben a uniform?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said I would, if he thought it necessary to have one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll answer for it, he\\'ll think it necessary, \" said Hal, laughing,\\r\\n\"because it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Allow him, at least, to judge for himself,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear uncle, but I assure you,\" said Hal, earnestly, \"there\\'s no\\r\\njudging about the matter, because really, upon my word, Lady Diana said\\r\\ndistinctly, that her sons were to have uniforms, white faced with green,\\r\\nand a green and white cockade in their hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be so,\" said Mr. Gresham, still with the same look of calm\\r\\nsimplicity; \"put on your hats, boys, and come with me.  I know a\\r\\ngentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting, and we will\\r\\ninquire into all the particulars from him.  Then, after we have seen him\\r\\n(it is not eleven o\\'clock yet) we shall have time enough to walk on to\\r\\nBristol, and choose the cloth for Ben\\'s uniform, if it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot tell what to make of all he says,\" whispered Hal, as he reached\\r\\ndown his hat; \"do you think, Ben, he means to give you this uniform, or\\r\\nnot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Ben, \"that he means to give me one, if it is necessary;\\r\\nor, as he said, if I think it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that to be sure you will; won\\'t you? or else you\\'ll be a great fool,\\r\\nI know, after all I\\'ve told you.  How can anyone in the world know so\\r\\nmuch about the matter as I, who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\r\\nbut yesterday, and heard all about it from beginning to end?  And as for\\r\\nthis gentleman that we are going to, I\\'m sure, if he knows anything about\\r\\nthe matter, he\\'ll say exactly the same as I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall hear,\" said Ben, with a degree of composure which Hal could by\\r\\nno means comprehend when a uniform was in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman upon whom Mr. Gresham called had three sons, who were all\\r\\nto be at this archery meeting; and they unanimously assured him, in the\\r\\npresence of Hal and Ben, that they had never thought of buying uniforms\\r\\nfor this grand occasion, and that, amongst the number of their\\r\\nacquaintance, they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at\\r\\nsuch an UNNECESSARY expense.  Hal stood amazed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Gresham, looking at his nephews.  \"What amongst one set of\\r\\npeople you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary, you will hear from\\r\\nanother set of people is quite unnecessary.  All that can be done, my\\r\\ndear boys, in these difficult cases, is to judge for yourselves, which\\r\\nopinions, and which people, are the most reasonable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable, than\\r\\nof what was reasonable, without at all considering the good sense of what\\r\\nhis uncle said to him, replied, with childish petulance, \"Indeed, sir, I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what other people think; but I only know what Lady Diana\\r\\nSweepstakes said.\"  The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes, Hal thought, must\\r\\nimpress all present with respect; he was highly astonished, when, as he\\r\\nlooked round, he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone\\'s countenance:\\r\\nand he was yet further bewildered, when he heard her spoken of as a very\\r\\nsilly, extravagant, ridiculous woman, whose opinion no prudent person\\r\\nwould ask upon any subject, and whose example was to be shunned, instead\\r\\nof being imitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, my dear Hal,\" said his uncle, smiling at his look of amazement,\\r\\n\"these are some of the things that young people must learn from\\r\\nexperience.  All the world do not agree in opinion about characters:  you\\r\\nwill hear the same person admired in one company, and blamed in another;\\r\\nso that we must still come round to the same point, \\'Judge for\\r\\nyourself.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal\\'s thoughts were, however, at present too full of the uniform to allow\\r\\nhis judgment to act with perfect impartiality.  As soon as their visit\\r\\nwas over, and all the time they walked down the hill from Prince\\'s\\r\\nBuilding\\'s towards Bristol, he continued to repeat nearly the same\\r\\narguments, which he had formerly used, respecting necessity, the uniform,\\r\\nand Lady Diana Sweepstakes.  To all this Mr. Gresham made no reply, and\\r\\nlonger had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject, which had so\\r\\nstrongly seized upon his imagination, had not his senses been forcibly\\r\\nassailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of\\r\\ncertain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook\\'s shop.  \"Oh, uncle,\" said he,\\r\\nas his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol,\\r\\n\"look at those jellies!\" pointing to a confectioner\\'s shop.  \"I must buy\\r\\nsome of those good things, for I have got some halfpence in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Gresham, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I really am hungry,\" said Hal; \"you know, uncle, it is a good while\\r\\nsince breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis uncle, who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint,\\r\\nthat he might judge their characters, bid them do as they pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then, Ben, if you\\'ve any halfpence in your pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not hungry,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose THAT means that you\\'ve no halfpence,\" said Hal, laughing, with\\r\\nthe look of superiority which he had been taught to think the RICH might\\r\\nassume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waste not, want not,\" said Ben to himself.  Contrary to his cousin\\'s\\r\\nsurmise, he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his\\r\\npocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very moment Hal stepped into the pastrycook\\'s shop, a poor,\\r\\nindustrious man, with a wooden leg, who usually sweeps the dirty corner\\r\\nof the walk which turns at this spot to the Wells, held his hat to Ben,\\r\\nwho, after glancing his eye at the petitioner\\'s well worn broom,\\r\\ninstantly produced his twopence.  \"I wish I had more halfpence for you,\\r\\nmy good man,\" said he; \"but I\\'ve only twopence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal came out of Mr. Millar\\'s, the confectioner\\'s shop, with a hatful of\\r\\ncakes in his hand.  Mr. Millar\\'s dog was sitting on the flags before the\\r\\ndoor, and he looked up with a wistful, begging eye at Hal, who was eating\\r\\na queen cake.  Hal, who was wasteful even in his good-nature, threw a\\r\\nwhole queen cake to the dog, who swallowed it for a single mouthful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There goes twopence in the form of a queen cake,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin; but they\\r\\nthanked him, and refused to eat any, because, they said, they were not\\r\\nhungry; so he ate and ate as he walked along, till at last he stopped,\\r\\nand said, \"This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes, I can\\'t bear\\r\\nit!\" and he was going to fling it from him into the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is a pity to waste that good bun; we may be glad of it yet,\" said\\r\\nBen; \"give it me rather than throw it away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I thought you said you were not hungry,\" said Hal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, I am not hungry now; but that is no reason why I should never be\\r\\nhungry again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there is the cake for you.  Take it; for it has made me sick, and\\r\\nI don\\'t care what becomes of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen folded the refuse bit of his cousin\\'s bun in a piece of paper, and\\r\\nput it into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something,\" said Hal;\\r\\n\"and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts, had not we\\r\\nbetter take a coach, instead of walking all the way to Bristol?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a stout archer,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"you are more easily tired than\\r\\none might have expected.  However, with all my heart, let us take a\\r\\ncoach, for Ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday; and I\\r\\nbelieve I should find it rather too much for me to walk so far, though I\\r\\nam not sick with eating good things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE CATHEDRAL!\" said Hal, after he had been seated in the coach about a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, and had somewhat recovered from his sickness--\"the\\r\\ncathedral!  Why, are we only going to Bristol to see the cathedral?  I\\r\\nthought we came out to see about a uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in Hal\\'s countenance\\r\\nas he pronounced these words, like one wakening from a dream, which made\\r\\nboth his uncle and his cousin burst out a-laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Hal, who was now piqued, \"I\\'m sure you did say, uncle, you\\r\\nwould go to Mr. Hall\\'s to choose the cloth for the uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, and so I will,\" said Mr. Gresham; \"but we need not make a\\r\\nwhole morning\\'s work, need we, of looking at a piece of cloth?  Cannot we\\r\\nsee a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went first to the cathedral.  Hal\\'s head was too full of the uniform\\r\\nto take any notice of the painted window, which immediately caught Ben\\'s\\r\\nembarrassed attention.  He looked at the large stained figures on the\\r\\nGothic window, and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham, who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain\\r\\ninformation, took this opportunity of telling him several things about\\r\\nthe lost art of painting on glass, Gothic arches, etc., which Hal thought\\r\\nextremely tiresome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come! come! we shall be late indeed,\" said Hal; \"surely you\\'ve looked\\r\\nlong enough, Ben, at this blue and red window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m only thinking about these coloured shadows,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can show you when we go home, Ben,\" said his uncle, \"an entertaining\\r\\npaper upon such shadows.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Vide \"Priestley\\'s History of Vision,\" chapter on coloured shadows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hark!\" cried Ben, \"did you hear that noise?\"  They all listened; and\\r\\nthey heard a bird singing in the cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s our old robin, sir,\" said the lad who had opened the cathedral door\\r\\nfor them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"there he is, boys--look--perched upon the\\r\\norgan; he often sits there, and sings, whilst the organ is playing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" continued the lad who showed the cathedral, \"he has lived here\\r\\nthese many, many winters.  They say he is fifteen years old; and he is so\\r\\ntame, poor fellow! that if I had a bit of bread he\\'d come down and feed\\r\\nin my hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve a bit of bun here,\" cried Ben, joyfully, producing the remains of\\r\\nthe bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away.  \"Pray, let\\r\\nus see the poor robin eat out of your hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lad crumbled the bun, and called to the robin, who fluttered and\\r\\nchirped, and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread; but yet he did\\r\\nnot come down from his pinnacle on the organ.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is afraid of US,\" said Ben; \"he is not used to eat before strangers,\\r\\nI suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, no, sir,\" said the young man, with a deep sigh, \"that is not the\\r\\nthing.  He is used enough to eat afore company.  Time was he\\'d have come\\r\\ndown for me before ever so many fine folks, and have eat his crumbs out\\r\\nof my hand, at my first call; but, poor fellow! it\\'s not his fault now.\\r\\nHe does not know me now, sir, since my accident, because of this great\\r\\nblack patch.\"  The young man put his hand to his right eye, which was\\r\\ncovered with a huge black patch.  Ben asked what ACCIDENT he meant; and\\r\\nthe lad told him that, but a few weeks ago, he had lost the sight of his\\r\\neye by the stroke of a stone, which reached him as he was passing under\\r\\nthe rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting.  \"I don\\'t\\r\\nmind so much for myself, sir,\" said the lad; \"but I can\\'t work so well\\r\\nnow, as I used to do before my accident, for my old mother, who has had a\\r\\nSTROKE of the palsy; and I\\'ve a many little brothers and sisters not well\\r\\nable yet to get their own livelihood, though they be as willing as\\r\\nwilling can be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does your mother live?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hard by, sir, just close to the church here:  it was HER that always had\\r\\nthe showing of it to strangers, till she lost the use of her poor limbs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we, may we, uncle, go that way?  This is the house; is not it?\"\\r\\nsaid Ben, when they went out of the cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went into the house; it was rather a hovel than a house; but, poor\\r\\nas it was, it was as neat as misery could make it.  The old woman was\\r\\nsitting up in her wretched bed, winding worsted; four meagre, ill-\\r\\nclothed, pale children were all busy, some of them sticking pins in paper\\r\\nfor the pin-maker, and others sorting rags for the paper-maker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a horrid place it is!\" said Hal, sighing; \"I did not know there\\r\\nwere such shocking places in the world.  I\\'ve often seen terrible-\\r\\nlooking, tumble-down places, as we drove through the town in mamma\\'s\\r\\ncarriage; but then I did not know who lived in them; and I never saw the\\r\\ninside of any of them.  It is very dreadful, indeed, to think that people\\r\\nare forced to live in this way.  I wish mamma would send me some more\\r\\npocket-money, that I might do something for them.  I had half a crown;\\r\\nbut,\" continued he, feeling in his pockets, \"I\\'m afraid I spent the last\\r\\nshilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick.  I wish I\\r\\nhad my shilling now, I\\'d give it to these poor people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen, though he was all this time silent, was as sorry as his talkative\\r\\ncousin for all these poor people.  But there was some difference between\\r\\nthe sorrow of these two boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, after he was again seated in the hackney-coach, and had rattled\\r\\nthrough the busy streets of Bristol, for a few minutes quite forgot the\\r\\nspectacle of misery which he had seen; and the gay shops in Wine Street\\r\\nand the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for our uniforms!\" cried he, as he jumped eagerly out of the coach,\\r\\nwhen his uncle stopped at the woollen-draper\\'s door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle,\" said Ben, stopping Mr. Gresham before he got out of the\\r\\ncarriage, \"I don\\'t think a uniform is at all necessary for me.  I\\'m very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you; but I would rather not have one.  I have a very good\\r\\ncoat, and I think it would be waste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let me get out of the carriage, and we will see about it,\" said\\r\\nMr. Gresham; \"perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth,\\r\\nand the epaulettes (have you ever considered the epaulettes?) may tempt\\r\\nyou to change your mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ben, laughing; \"I shall not change my mind,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green cloth, and the white cloth, and the epaulettes were produced,\\r\\nto Hal\\'s infinite satisfaction.  His uncle took up a pen, and calculated\\r\\nfor a few minutes; then, showing the back of the letter, upon which he\\r\\nwas writing, to his nephews, \"Cast up these sums, boys,\" said he, \"and\\r\\ntell me whether I am right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben, do you do it,\" said Hal, a little embarrassed; \"I am not quick at\\r\\nfigures.\"  Ben WAS, and he went over his uncle\\'s calculation very\\r\\nexpeditiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is right, is it?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, quite right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, by this calculation, I find I could, for less than half the money\\r\\nyour uniforms would cost, purchase for each of you boys a warm great-\\r\\ncoat, which you will want, I have a notion, this winter upon the Downs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir,\" said Hal, with an alarmed look; \"but it is not winter YET; it\\r\\nis not cold weather YET.  We sha\\'n\\'t want greatcoats YET.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you remember how cold we were, Hal, the day before yesterday, in\\r\\nthat sharp wind, when we were flying our kite upon the Downs? and winter\\r\\nwill come, though it is not come yet--I am sure, I should like to have a\\r\\ngood warm great-coat very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them\\r\\nbefore Hal, and three before Ben.  \"Young gentlemen,\" said he, \"I believe\\r\\nyour uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece.  Now I will lay\\r\\nout this money for you just as you please.  Hal, what say you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said Hal, \"a great-coat is a good thing, to be sure; and\\r\\nthen, after the great-coat, as you said it would only cost half as much\\r\\nas the uniform, there would be some money to spare, would not there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my dear, about five-and-twenty shillings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Five-and-twenty shillings?--I could buy and do a great many things, to\\r\\nbe sure, with five-and-twenty shillings; but then, THE THING IS, I must\\r\\ngo without the uniform, if I have the great-coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said his uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Hal, sighing, as he looked at the epaulettes, \"uncle, if you\\r\\nwould not be displeased, if I choose the uniform--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best,\" said\\r\\nMr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, thank you, sir,\" said Hal; \"I think I had better have the\\r\\nuniform, because, if I have not the uniform, now, directly, it will be of\\r\\nno use to me, as the archery meeting is the week after next, you know;\\r\\nand, as to the great-coat, perhaps between this time and the VERY cold\\r\\nweather, which, perhaps, won\\'t be till Christmas, papa will buy a great-\\r\\ncoat for me; and I\\'ll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give\\r\\naway, and she will, perhaps.\"  To all this conclusive, conditional\\r\\nreasoning, which depended upon the word PERHAPS, three times repeated,\\r\\nMr. Gresham made no reply; but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal,\\r\\nand desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\' son\\'s\\r\\ntailor, to be made up.  The measure of Hal\\'s happiness was now complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you, Ben?\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham; \"speak, what do you wish for first?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great-coat, uncle, if you please.\"  Gresham bought the coat; and,\\r\\nafter it was paid for, five-and-twenty shillings of Ben\\'s three guineas\\r\\nremained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What next, my boy?\" said his uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arrows, uncle, if you please; three arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, I promised you a bow and arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, uncle, you only said a bow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I meant a bow and arrows.  I\\'m glad you are so exact, however.  It\\r\\nis better to claim less than more than what is promised.  The three\\r\\narrows you shall have.  But go on; how shall I dispose of these five-and-\\r\\ntwenty shillings for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In clothes, if you will be so good, uncle, for that poor boy who has the\\r\\ngreat black patch on his eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always believed,\" said Mr. Gresham, shaking hands with Ben, \"that\\r\\neconomy and generosity were the best friends, instead of being enemies,\\r\\nas some silly, extravagant people would have us think them.  Choose the\\r\\npoor, blind boy\\'s coat, my dear nephew, and pay for it.  There\\'s no\\r\\noccasion for my praising you about the matter.  Your best reward is in\\r\\nyour own mind, child; and you want no other, or I\\'m mistaken.  Now, jump\\r\\ninto the coach, boys, and let\\'s be off.  We shall be late, I\\'m afraid,\"\\r\\ncontinued he, as the coach drove on:  \"but I must let you stop, Ben, with\\r\\nyour goods, at the poor boy\\'s door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the house, Mr. Gresham opened the coach door, and Ben\\r\\njumped out with his parcel under his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay, stay! you must take me with you,\" said his pleased uncle; \"I like\\r\\nto see people made happy, as well as you do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I, too,\" said Hal; \"let me come with you.  I almost wish my\\r\\nuniform was not gone to the tailor\\'s, so I do.\"  And when he saw the look\\r\\nof delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes\\r\\nwhich Ben gave him; and when he heard the mother and children thank him,\\r\\nhe sighed, and said, \"Well, I hope mamma will give me some more pocket\\r\\nmoney soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his return home, however, the sight of the FAMOUS bow and arrow,\\r\\nwhich Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent him, recalled to his imagination\\r\\nall the joys of his green and white uniform; and he no longer wished that\\r\\nit had not been sent to the tailor\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t understand, Cousin Hal,\" said little Patty, \"why you call\\r\\nthis bow a FAMOUS bow.  You say famous very often; and I don\\'t know\\r\\nexactly what it means; a famous uniform--famous doings.  I remember you\\r\\nsaid there are to be famous doings, the first of September, upon the\\r\\nDowns.  What does famous mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, why, famous means--now, don\\'t you know what famous means?  It means-\\r\\n-it is a word that people say--it is the fashion to say it--it means--it\\r\\nmeans famous.\"  Patty laughed, and said, \"This does not explain it to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hal, \"nor can it be explained:  if you don\\'t understand it,\\r\\nthat\\'s not my fault.  Everybody but little children, I suppose,\\r\\nunderstands it; but there\\'s no explaining THOSE SORT of words, if you\\r\\ndon\\'t TAKE THEM at once.  There\\'s to be famous doings upon the Downs, the\\r\\nfirst of September; that is grand, fine.  In short, what does it signify\\r\\ntalking any longer, Patty, about the matter?  Give me my bow, for I must\\r\\ngo out upon the Downs and practise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had\\r\\nnow given to him; and, every day, these two boys went out upon the Downs\\r\\nand practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance.  Where equal\\r\\npains are taken, success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal.  Our\\r\\ntwo archers, by constant practice, became expert marksmen; and before the\\r\\nday of trial, they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity, that it\\r\\nwas scarcely possible to decide which was superior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long expected lst of September at length arrived.  \"What sort of a\\r\\nday is it?\" was the first question that was asked by Hal and Ben the\\r\\nmoment that they wakened.  The sun shone bright, but there was a sharp\\r\\nand high wind.  \"Ha!\" said Ben, \"I shall be glad of my good great-coat\\r\\nto-day; for I\\'ve a notion it will be rather cold upon the Downs,\\r\\nespecially when we are standing still, as we must, whilst all the people\\r\\nare shooting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never mind!  I don\\'t think I shall feel it cold at all,\" said Hal,\\r\\nas he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform; and he viewed\\r\\nhimself with much complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning to you, uncle; how do you do?\" said he, in a voice of\\r\\nexultation, when he entered the breakfast-room.  How do you do? seemed\\r\\nrather to mean, \"How do you like me in my uniform?\"  And his uncle\\'s\\r\\ncool, \"Very well, I thank you, Hal,\" disappointed him, as it seemed only\\r\\nto say, \"Your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven little Patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual, and talked\\r\\nof the pleasure of walking with her father to the Downs, and of all the\\r\\nlittle things which interested her; so that Hal\\'s epaulettes were not the\\r\\nprincipal object in anyone\\'s imagination but his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa,\" said Patty, \"as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud,\\r\\nI must take care to pick my way nicely; and I must hold up my frock, as\\r\\nyou desired me, and, perhaps, you will be so good, if I am not\\r\\ntroublesome, to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping-\\r\\nstones.  My ankle is entirely well, and I\\'m glad of that, or else I\\r\\nshould not be able to walk so far as the Downs.  How good you were to me,\\r\\nBen, when I was in pain the day I sprained my ankle!  You played at jack\\r\\nstraws and at cat\\'s-cradle with me.  Oh, that puts me in mind--here are\\r\\nyour gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend.  I\\'ve been a\\r\\ngreat while about them; but are not they not very neatly mended, papa?\\r\\nLook at the sewing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not a very good judge of sewing, my dear little girl,\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham, examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye; \"but, in my\\r\\nopinion, here is one stitch that is rather too long.  The white teeth are\\r\\nnot quite even.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, I\\'ll take out that long tooth in a minute,\" said Patty,\\r\\nlaughing; \"I did not think that you would observe it so soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not have you trust to my blindness,\" said her father, stroking\\r\\nher head, fondly; \"I observe everything.  I observe, for instance, that\\r\\nyou are a grateful little girl, and that you are glad to be of use to\\r\\nthose who have been kind to you; and for this I forgive you the long\\r\\nstitch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it\\'s out, it\\'s out, papa,\" said Patty; \"and the next time your\\r\\ngloves want mending, Ben, I\\'ll mend them better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are very nice, I think,\" said Ben, drawing them on; \"and I am much\\r\\nobliged to you.  I was just wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my\\r\\nfingers warm to-day, for I never can shoot well when my hands are\\r\\nbenumbed.  Look, Hal; you know how ragged these gloves were; you said\\r\\nthey were good for nothing but to throw away; now look, there\\'s not a\\r\\nhole in them,\" said he, spreading his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, is it not very extraordinary,\" said Hal to himself, \"that they\\r\\nshould go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves, without saying\\r\\nscarcely a word about my new uniform?  Well, the young Sweepstakes and\\r\\nLady Diana will talk enough about it; that\\'s one comfort.  Is not it time\\r\\nto think of setting out, sir?\" said Hal to his uncle.  \"The company, you\\r\\nknow, are to meet at the Ostrich at twelve, and the race to begin at one,\\r\\nand Lady Diana\\'s horses, I know were ordered to be at the door at ten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Stephen, the butler, here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in\\r\\nhis calculations.  \"There\\'s a poor lad, sir, below, with a great black\\r\\npatch on his right eye, who is come from Bristol, and wants to speak a\\r\\nword with the young gentlemen, if you please.  I told him they were just\\r\\ngoing out with you; but he says he won\\'t detain them more than half a\\r\\nminute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Show him up, show him up,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, I suppose,\" said Hal, with a sigh, \"that Stephen mistook, when he\\r\\nsaid the young GENTLEMEN; he only wants to see Ben, I daresay; I\\'m sure\\r\\nhe has no reason to want to see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here he comes--Oh, Ben, he is dressed in the new coat you gave him,\"\\r\\nwhispered Hal, who was really a good-natured boy, though extravagant.\\r\\n\"How much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat!  Ah! he looked\\r\\nat you first, Ben--and well he may!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy bowed, without any cringing servility, but with an open, decent\\r\\nfreedom in his manner, which expressed that he had been obliged, but that\\r\\nhe knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation.  He made\\r\\nas little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I was sent with a message, by the clerk of our parish, to Redland\\r\\nchapel out on the Downs, to-day, sir,\" said he to Mr. Gresham, \"knowing\\r\\nyour house lay in my way, my mother, sir, bid me call, and make bold to\\r\\noffer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked\\r\\nfor them,\" continued the lad, pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls\\r\\nworked in green and orange-coloured stripes.  \"They are but poor things,\\r\\nsir, she bid me say, to look at; but, considering she has but one hand to\\r\\nwork with, and that her left hand, you\\'ll not despise \\'em, we hopes.\"  He\\r\\nheld the balls to Ben and Hal.  \"They are both alike, gentlemen,\" said\\r\\nhe.  \"If you\\'ll be pleased to take \\'em they\\'re better than they look, for\\r\\nthey bound higher than your head.  I cut the cork round for the inside\\r\\nmyself, which was all I could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are nice balls, indeed:  we are much obliged to you,\" said the boys\\r\\nas they received them, and they proved them immediately.  The balls\\r\\nstruck the floor with a delightful sound, and rebounded higher than Mr.\\r\\nGresham\\'s head.  Little Patty clapped her hands joyfully.  But now a\\r\\nthundering double rap at the door was heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Master Sweepstakes, sir,\" said Stephen, \"are come for Master Hal.\\r\\nThey say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to\\r\\nwalk together, in a body, I think they say, sir; and they are to parade\\r\\nalong the Well Walk, they desired me to say, sir, with a drum and fife,\\r\\nand so up the hill by Prince\\'s Place, and all to go upon the Downs\\r\\ntogether, to the place of meeting.  I am not sure I\\'m right, sir; for\\r\\nboth the young gentlemen spoke at once, and the wind is very high at the\\r\\nstreet door; so that I could not well make out all they said; but I\\r\\nbelieve this is the sense of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Hal, eagerly, \"it\\'s all right.  I know that is just what\\r\\nwas settled the day I dined at Lady Diana\\'s; and Lady Diana and a great\\r\\nparty of gentlemen are to ride--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that is nothing to the purpose,\" interrupted Mr. Gresham.  \"Don\\'t\\r\\nkeep these Master Sweepstakes waiting.  Decide--do you choose to go with\\r\\nthem or with us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir--uncle--sir, you know, since all the UNIFORMS agreed to go together-\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you, then, Mr. Uniform, if you mean to go,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows.\\r\\nBen discovered this when he went to fetch his own; and the lad from\\r\\nBristol, who had been ordered by Mr. Gresham to eat his breakfast before\\r\\nhe proceeded to Redland Chapel, heard Ben talking about his cousin\\'s bow\\r\\nand arrows.  \"I know,\" said Ben, \"he will be sorry not to have his bow\\r\\nwith him, because here are the green knots tied to it, to match his\\r\\ncockade:  and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows, as part\\r\\nof the show.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'ll give me leave, sir,\" said the poor Bristol lad, \"I shall have\\r\\nplenty of time; and I\\'ll run down to the Well Walk after the young\\r\\ngentleman, and take him his bow and arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you?  I shall be much obliged to you,\" said Ben; and away went the\\r\\nboy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public walk leading to the Wells was full of company.  The windows of\\r\\nall the houses in St. Vincent\\'s Parade were crowded with well dressed\\r\\nladies, who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession.\\r\\nParties of gentlemen and ladies, and a motley crowd of spectators, were\\r\\nseen moving backwards and forwards, under the rocks, on the opposite side\\r\\nof the water.  A barge, with coloured streamers flying, was waiting to\\r\\ntake up a party who were going upon the water.  The bargemen rested upon\\r\\ntheir oars, and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene\\r\\nthat appeared upon the public walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the\\r\\nsemicircular piazza just before Mrs. Yearsley\\'s library.  A little band\\r\\nof children, who had been mustered by Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\' SPIRITED\\r\\nEXERTIONS, closed the procession.  They were now all in readiness.  The\\r\\ndrummer only waited for her ladyship\\'s signal; and the archers\\' corps\\r\\nonly waited for her ladyship\\'s word of command to march.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are your bow and arrows, my little man?\" said her ladyship to Hal,\\r\\nas she reviewed her Lilliputian regiment.  \"You can\\'t march, man, without\\r\\nyour arms?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow, but the messenger\\r\\nreturned not.  He looked from side to side in great distress--\"Oh,\\r\\nthere\\'s my bow coming, I declare!\" cried he; \"look, I see the bow and the\\r\\nribands.  Look now, between the trees, Charles Sweepstakes, on the\\r\\nHotwell Walk; it is coming!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ve kept us all waiting a confounded time,\" said his impatient\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is that good-natured poor fellow from Bristol, I protest, that has\\r\\nbrought it me; I\\'m sure I don\\'t deserve it from him,\" said Hal, to\\r\\nhimself, when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running,\\r\\nquite out of breath, towards him, with his bow and arrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fall back, my good friend--fall back,\" said the military lady, as soon\\r\\nas he had delivered the bow to Hal; \"I mean, stand out of the way, for\\r\\nyour great patch cuts no figure amongst us.  Don\\'t follow so close, now,\\r\\nas if you belonged to us, pray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph; he FELL BACK as soon\\r\\nas he understood the meaning of the lady\\'s words.  The drum beat, the\\r\\nfife played, the archers marched, the spectators admired.  Hal stepped\\r\\nproudly, and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his\\r\\nepaulettes, or upon the facings of his uniform; whilst all the time he\\r\\nwas considered only as part of a show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walk appeared much shorter than usual, and he was extremely sorry\\r\\nthat Lady Diana, when they were half-way up the hill leading to Prince\\'s\\r\\nPlace, mounted her horse, because the road was dirty, and all the\\r\\ngentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can leave the children to walk, you know,\" said she to the gentleman\\r\\nwho helped her to mount her horse.  \"I must call to some of them, though,\\r\\nand leave orders where they are to join.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe beckoned:  and Hal, who was foremost, and proud to show his alacrity,\\r\\nran on to receive her ladyship\\'s orders.  Now, as we have before\\r\\nobserved, it was a sharp and windy day; and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\r\\nwas actually speaking to him, and looking at him, he could not prevent\\r\\nhis nose from wanting to be blowed:  he pulled out his handkerchief and\\r\\nout rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left\\r\\nhome, and which, according to his usual careless habits, he had stuffed\\r\\ninto his pockets in his hurry.  \"Oh, my new ball!\" cried he, as he ran\\r\\nafter it.  As he stopped to pick it up, he let go his hat, which he had\\r\\nhitherto held on with anxious care; for the hat, though it had a fine\\r\\ngreen and white cockade, had no band or string round it.  The string, as\\r\\nwe may recollect, our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top.  The\\r\\nhat was too large for his head without this band; a sudden gust of wind\\r\\nblew it off.  Lady Diana\\'s horse started and reared.  She was a FAMOUS\\r\\nhorse woman, and sat him to the admiration of all beholders; but there\\r\\nwas a puddle of red clay and water in this spot, and her ladyship\\'s\\r\\nuniform habit was a sufferer by the accident.  \"Careless brat!\" said she,\\r\\n\"why can\\'t he keep his hat upon his head?\"  In the meantime, the wind\\r\\nblew the hat down the hill, and Hal ran after it amidst the laughter of\\r\\nhis kind friends, the young Sweepstakes, and the rest of the little\\r\\nregiment.  The hat was lodged, at length, upon a bank.  Hal pursued it:\\r\\nhe thought this bank was hard, but, alas! the moment he set his foot upon\\r\\nit the foot sank.  He tried to draw it back; his other foot slipped, and\\r\\nhe fell prostrate, in his green and white uniform, into the treacherous\\r\\nbed of red mud.  His companions, who had halted upon the top of the hill,\\r\\nstood laughing, spectators of his misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye, who had\\r\\nbeen ordered by Lady Diana to \"fall back\" and to \"keep at a distance,\"\\r\\nwas now coming up the hill; and the moment he saw our fallen hero, he\\r\\nhastened to his assistance.  He dragged poor Hal, who was a deplorable\\r\\nspectacle, out of the red mud.  The obliging mistress of a lodging house,\\r\\nas soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to Mr.\\r\\nGresham, to whom she had formerly let her house, received Hal, covered as\\r\\nhe was with dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr. Gresham\\'s for clean stockings and\\r\\nshoes for Hal.  He was unwilling to give up his uniform:  it was rubbed\\r\\nand rubbed, and a spot here and there was washed out; and he kept\\r\\ncontinually repeating,--\"When it\\'s dry it will all brush off--when it\\'s\\r\\ndry it will all brush off, won\\'t it?\"  But soon the fear of being too\\r\\nlate at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in\\r\\nhis stained habiliments; and he now as anxiously repeated, whilst the\\r\\nwoman held the wet coat to the fire, \"Oh, I shall be too late; indeed, I\\r\\nshall be too late; make haste; it will never dry; hold it nearer--nearer\\r\\nto the fire.  I shall lose my turn to shoot; oh, give me the coat; I\\r\\ndon\\'t mind how it is, if I can but get it on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly, to be sure;\\r\\nbut it shrunk it also, so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on\\r\\nagain.  However, Hal, who did not see the red splashes, which, in spite\\r\\nof all these operations, were too visible upon his shoulders, and upon\\r\\nthe skirts of his white coat behind, was pretty well satisfied to observe\\r\\nthat there was not one spot upon the facings.  \"Nobody,\" said he, \"will\\r\\ntake notice of my coat behind, I daresay.  I think it looks as smart\\r\\nalmost as ever!\"--and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his\\r\\nbow--his bow with green ribands, now no more!--and he pursued his way to\\r\\nthe Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll his companions were far out of sight.  \"I suppose,\" said he to his\\r\\nfriend with the black patch--\"I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home\\r\\nbefore you went for the shoes and stockings for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, sir; the butler said they had been gone to the Downs a matter\\r\\nof a good half-hour or more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal trudged on as fast as he possibly could.  When he got upon the Downs,\\r\\nhe saw numbers of carriages, and crowds of people, all going towards the\\r\\nplace of meeting at the Ostrich.  He pressed forwards.  He was at first\\r\\nso much afraid of being late, that he did not take notice of the mirth\\r\\nhis motley appearance excited in all beholders.  At length he reached the\\r\\nappointed spot.  There was a great crowd of people.  In the midst he\\r\\nheard Lady Diana\\'s loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to\\r\\nshoot at the mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So then the shooting is begun, is it?\" said Hal.  \"Oh, let me in! pray\\r\\nlet me into the circle!  I\\'m one of the archers--I am, indeed; don\\'t you\\r\\nsee my green and white uniform?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your red and white uniform, you mean,\" said the man to whom he addressed\\r\\nhimself; and the people, as they opened a passage for him, could not\\r\\nrefrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited.\\r\\nIn vain, when he got into the midst of the formidable circle, he looked\\r\\nto his friends, the young Sweepstakes, for their countenance and support.\\r\\nThey were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers.  Lady Diana also\\r\\nseemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why could you not keep your hat upon your head, man?\" said she, in her\\r\\nmasculine tone.  \"You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit;\\r\\nbut I\\'ve escaped rather better than you have.  Don\\'t stand there, in the\\r\\nmiddle of the circle, or you\\'ll have an arrow in your eyes just now, I\\'ve\\r\\na notion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal looked round in search of better friends.  \"Oh, where\\'s my uncle?--\\r\\nwhere\\'s Ben?\" said he.  He was in such confusion, that, amongst the\\r\\nnumber of faces, he could scarcely distinguish one from another; but he\\r\\nfelt somebody at this moment pull his elbow, and, to his great relief, he\\r\\nheard the friendly voice, and saw the good natured face of his Cousin\\r\\nBen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come back; come behind these people,\" said Ben, \"and put on my great-\\r\\ncoat; here it is for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRight glad was Hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great-\\r\\ncoat which he had formerly despised.  He pulled the stained, drooping\\r\\ncockade out of his unfortunate hat; and he was now sufficiently recovered\\r\\nfrom his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his\\r\\nuncle and Patty, who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long,\\r\\nand what had been the matter.  In the midst of the history of his\\r\\ndisaster, he was just proving to Patty that his taking the hatband to\\r\\nspin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time endeavouring to refute his uncle\\'s opinion that the waste of\\r\\nthe whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his\\r\\nevils, when he was summoned to try his skill with his FAMOUS bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hands are benumbed; I can scarcely feel,\" said he, rubbing them, and\\r\\nblowing upon the ends of his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come,\" cried young Sweepstakes, \"I\\'m within one inch of the mark;\\r\\nwho\\'ll go nearer? I shall like to see.  Shoot away, Hal; but first\\r\\nunderstand our laws; we settled them before you came upon the green.  You\\r\\nare to have three shots, with your own bow and your own arrows; and\\r\\nnobody\\'s to borrow or lend under pretence of other\\'s bows being better or\\r\\nworse, or under any pretence.  Do you hear, Hal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws,\\r\\nas he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow\\r\\nas he had provided for himself.  Some of the boys had forgotten to bring\\r\\nmore than one arrow with them, and by his cunning regulation that each\\r\\nperson should shoot with their own arrows, many had lost one or two of\\r\\ntheir shots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a lucky fellow; you have your three arrows,\" said young\\r\\nSweepstakes.  \"Come, we can\\'t wait whilst you rub your fingers, man--\\r\\nshoot away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke.  He\\r\\nlittle knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can\\r\\nchange when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition\\r\\nwith their friendship.  Hurried by his impatient rival, and with his\\r\\nhands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow\\r\\nin the string, he drew the bow.  The arrow was within a quarter of an\\r\\ninch of Master Sweepstakes\\' mark, which was the nearest that had yet been\\r\\nhit.  Hal seized his second arrow.  \"If I have any luck--\" said he.  But\\r\\njust as he pronounced the word LUCK, and as he bent his bow, the string\\r\\nbroke in two, and the bow fell from his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, it\\'s all over with you!\" cried Master Sweepstakes, with a\\r\\ntriumphant laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s my bow for him, and welcome,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, sir,\" said Master Sweepstakes, \"that is not fair; that\\'s against\\r\\nthe regulation.  You may shoot with your own bow, if you choose it, or\\r\\nyou may not, just as you think proper; but you must not lend it, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now Ben\\'s turn to make his trial.  His first arrow was not\\r\\nsuccessful.  His second was exactly as near as Hal\\'s first.  \"You have\\r\\nbut one more,\" said Master Sweepstakes--\"now for it!\"  Ben, before he\\r\\nventured his last arrow, prudently examined the string of his bow; and,\\r\\nas he pulled it to try its strength, it cracked.  Master Sweepstakes\\r\\nclapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter.  But his\\r\\nlaughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an\\r\\nexcellent piece of whip cord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The everlasting whip cord, I declare!\" exclaimed Hal, when he saw that\\r\\nit was the very same that had tied up the parcel.  \"Yes,\" said Ben, as he\\r\\nfastened it to his bow, \"I put it into my pocket, to-day, on purpose,\\r\\nbecause I thought I might happen to want it.\"  He drew his bow the third\\r\\nand last time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa!\" cried little Patty, as his arrow hit the mark, \"it\\'s the\\r\\nnearest; is it not the nearest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaster Sweepstakes, with anxiety, examined the hit.  There could be no\\r\\ndoubt.  Ben was victorious!  The bow, the prize bow, was now delivered to\\r\\nhim; and Hal, as he looked at the whip-cord exclaimed, \"How LUCKY this\\r\\nwhip-cord has been to you, Ben!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is LUCKY, perhaps you mean, that he took care of it,\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" said Hal, \"very true; he might well say, \\'Waste not, want not.\\'  It\\r\\nis a good thing to have two strings to one\\'s bow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD POZ.\\r\\n\\r\\n          LUCY, daughter to the Justice.\\r\\n          MRS.

You can\\'t see him, so go about your\\r\\nbusiness, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  To whom are you speaking, William?  Who\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Only an old man, miss, with a complaint for my master.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, then, don\\'t send him away--don\\'t send him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  But master has not had his chocolate, ma\\'am.  He won\\'t ever see\\r\\nanybody before he drinks his chocolate, you know, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But let the old man, then, come in here.  Perhaps he can wait a\\r\\nlittle while.  Call him.                (Exit Servant.)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy sings, and goes on watering her myrtles; the servant shows in the\\r\\nOld Man.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  You can\\'t see my master this hour; but miss will let you stay\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (aside).  Poor old man! how he trembles as he walks.  (Aloud.) Sit\\r\\ndown, sit down.  My father will see you soon; pray sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\n(He hesitates; she pushes a chair towards him.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Pray sit down.                     (He sits down.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Man.  You are very good, miss; very good.  (Lucy goes to her myrtles\\r\\nagain.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ah! I\\'m afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead--quite dead.\\r\\n(The Old Man sighs, and she turns round.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (aside).  I wonder what can make him sigh so!  (Aloud.)  My father\\r\\nwon\\'t make you wait long.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, ma\\'am, as long as he pleases.  I\\'m in no haste--no haste.\\r\\nIt\\'s only a small matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But does a small matter make you sigh so?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Ah, miss; because, though it is a small matter in itself, it is\\r\\nnot a small matter to me (sighing again); it was my all, and I\\'ve lost\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  What do you mean?  What have you lost?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Why, miss--but I won\\'t trouble you about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But it won\\'t trouble me at all--I mean, I wish to hear it; so tell\\r\\nit me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Why, miss, I slept last night at the inn here, in town--the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (interrupts him).  Hark! there is my father coming downstairs;\\r\\nfollow me.  You may tell me your story as we go along.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  I slept at the \"Saracen\\'s Head,\" miss, and--\\r\\n                                          (Exit, talking.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustice Headstrong\\'s Study.\\r\\n\\r\\n(He appears in his nightgown and cap, with his gouty foot upon a stool--a\\r\\ntable and chocolate beside him--Lucy is leaning on the arm of his chair.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, well, my darling, presently; I\\'ll see him presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Whilst you are drinking your chocolate, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, no, no--I never see anybody till I have done my chocolate,\\r\\ndarling.  (He tastes his chocolate.)  There\\'s no sugar in this, child.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Yes, indeed, papa.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, child--there\\'s NO sugar, I tell you; that poz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, but, papa, I assure you I put in two lumps myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  There\\'s NO sugar, I say; why will you contradict me, child, for\\r\\never?  There\\'s no sugar, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy leans over him playfully, and with his teaspoon pulls out two lumps\\r\\nof sugar.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  What\\'s this, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Pshaw! pshaw! pshaw!--it is not melted, child--it is the same as\\r\\nno sugar!.--Oh, my foot, girl, my foot!--you kill me.  Go, go, I\\'m busy.\\r\\nI\\'ve business to do.  Go and send William to me; do you hear, love?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  And the old man, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What old man?  I tell you what, I\\'ve been plagued ever since I was\\r\\nawake, and before I was awake, about that old man.  If he can\\'t wait, let\\r\\nhim go about his business.  Don\\'t you know, child, I never see anybody\\r\\ntill I\\'ve drunk my chocolate; and I never will, if it were a duke--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!  Why, it has but just struck twelve; if he can\\'t wait, he can go\\r\\nabout his business, can\\'t he?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, sir, he can wait.  It was not he who was impatient.  (She\\r\\ncomes back playfully.)  It was only I, papa; don\\'t be angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, well, well (finishing his cup of chocolate, and pushing his\\r\\ndish away); and at anyrate there was not sugar enough.  Send William,\\r\\nsend William, child; and I\\'ll finish my own business, and then--\\r\\n                (Exit Lucy, dancing, \"And then!--and then!\")\\r\\n\\r\\n                        JUSTICE, alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, this foot of mine!--(twinges)--Oh, this foot!  Ay, if Dr.\\r\\nSparerib could cure one of the gout, then, indeed, I should think\\r\\nsomething of him; but, as to my leaving off my bottle of port, it\\'s\\r\\nnonsense; it\\'s all nonsense; I can\\'t do it; I can\\'t, and won\\'t, for all\\r\\nthe Dr. Spareribs in Christendom; that\\'s poz!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter WILLIAM.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  William--oh! ay! hey! what answer, pray, did you bring from the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"?  Did you see Mrs. Bustle herself, as I bid you?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Yes, sir, I saw the landlady herself; she said she would come up\\r\\nimmediately, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ah, that\\'s well--immediately?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Yes, sir, and I hear her voice below now.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, show her up; show Mrs. Bustle in.\\r\\n\\r\\n         Enter Mrs. BUSTLE, the landlady of the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Good morrow to your worship!  I\\'m glad to see your worship look so\\r\\npurely.  I came up with all speed (taking breath).  Our pie is in the\\r\\noven; that was what you sent for me about, I take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  True; true; sit down, good Mrs. Bustle, pray--\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, your worship\\'s always very good (settling her apron).  I came\\r\\nup just as I was--only threw my shawl over me.  I thought your worship\\r\\nwould excuse--I\\'m quite, as it were, rejoiced to see your worship look so\\r\\npurely, and to find you up so hearty--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, I\\'m very hearty (coughing), always hearty, and thankful for\\r\\nit.  I hope to see many Christmas doings yet, Mrs. Bustle.  And so our\\r\\npie is in the oven, I think you say?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  In the oven it is.  I put it in with my own hands; and if we have\\r\\nbut good luck in the baking, it will be as pretty a goose-pie--though I\\r\\nsay it that should not say it--as pretty a goose-pie as ever your worship\\r\\nset your eyes upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Will you take a glass of anything this morning, Mrs. Bustle?--I\\r\\nhave some nice usquebaugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, no, your worship!--I thank your worship, though, as much as if\\r\\nI took it; but I just took my luncheon before I came up; or more proper,\\r\\nMY SANDWICH, I should say, for the fashion\\'s sake, to be sure.  A\\r\\nLUNCHEON won\\'t go down with nobody nowadays (laughs).  I expect hostler\\r\\nand boots will be calling for their sandwiches just now (laughs again).\\r\\nI\\'m sure I beg your worship\\'s pardon for mentioning a LUNCHEON.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, Mrs. Bustle, the word\\'s a good word, for it means a good\\r\\nthing--ha! ha! ha! (pulls out his watch); but pray, is it luncheon time.\\r\\nWhy, it\\'s past one, I declare; and I thought I was up in remarkably good\\r\\ntime, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Well, and to be sure so it was, remarkably good time for your\\r\\nworship; but folks in our way must be up betimes, you know.  I\\'ve been up\\r\\nand about these seven hours!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (stretching).  Seven hours!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, indeed--eight, I might say, for I am an early little body;\\r\\nthough I say it that should not say it--I AM an early little body.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  An early little body, as you say, Mrs. Bustle; so I shall have my\\r\\ngoose-pie for dinner, hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  For dinner, as sure as the clock strikes four--but I mustn\\'t stay\\r\\nprating, for it may be spoiling if I\\'m away; so I must wish your worship\\r\\na good morning.  (She curtsies.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No ceremony--no ceremony; good Mrs. Bustle, your servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter William, to take away the chocolate.  The Landlady is putting on\\r\\nher shawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  You may let that man know, William, that I have dispatched my OWN\\r\\nbusiness, and am at leisure for his now (taking a pinch of snuff).  Hum!\\r\\npray, William (Justice leans back gravely), what sort of a looking fellow\\r\\nis he, pray?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Most like a sort of travelling man, in my opinion, sir--or\\r\\nsomething that way, I take it,\\r\\n\\r\\n(At these words the landlady turns round inquisitively, and delays, that\\r\\nshe may listen, while she is putting on and pinning her shawl.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hum! a sort of a travelling man.  Hum! lay my books out open at\\r\\nthe title Vagrant; and, William, tell the cook that Mrs. Bustle promises\\r\\nme the goose-pie for dinner.  Four o\\'clock, do you hear?  And show the\\r\\nold man in now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The Landlady looks eagerly towards the door, as it opens, and exclaims,)\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  My old gentleman, as I hope to breathe!\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter the OLD MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy follows the Old Man on tiptoe--The Justice leans back and looks\\r\\nconsequential--The Landlady sets her arms akimbo--The Old Man starts as\\r\\nhe sees her.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What stops you, friend?  Come forward, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (advancing).  So, sir, is it you, sir?  Ay, you little thought, I\\r\\nwarrant ye, to meet me here with his worship; but there you reckoned\\r\\nwithout your host--Out of the frying-pan into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What is all this?  What is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (running on).  None of your flummery stuff will go down with his\\r\\nworship no more than with me, I give you warning; so you may go further\\r\\nand fare worse, and spare your breath to cool your porridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (waves his hand with dignity).  Mrs. Bustle, good Mrs. Bustle,\\r\\nremember where you are.  Silence! silence!  Come forward, sir, and let me\\r\\nhear what you have to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The Old Man comes forward.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Who and what may you be, friend, and what is your business with\\r\\nme?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Sir, if your worship will give me leave--\\r\\n\\r\\n                        (Justice makes a sign to her to be silent).\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, I am an old soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (interrupting).  An old hypocrite, say.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Mrs. Bustle, pray, I desire, let the man speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  For these two years past--ever since, please your worship--I\\r\\nwasn\\'t able to work any longer; for in my youth I did work as well as the\\r\\nbest of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (eager to interrupt).  You work--you--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Let him finish his story, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ay, do, do, papa, speak for him.  Pray, Mrs. Bustle--\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (turning suddenly round to Lucy).  Miss, a good morrow to you,\\r\\nma\\'am.  I humbly beg your apologies for not seeing you sooner, Miss Lucy.\\r\\n            (Justice nods to the Old Man, who goes on.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Man.  But please your worship, it pleased God to take away the use of\\r\\nmy left arm; and since that I have never been able to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Flummery! flummery!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (angrily).  Mrs. Bustle, I have desired silence, and I will have\\r\\nit, that\\'s poz!  You shall have your turn presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  For these two years past (for why should I be ashamed to tell the\\r\\ntruth?) I have lived upon charity, and I scraped together a guinea and a\\r\\nhalf and upwards, and I was travelling with it to my grandson, in the\\r\\nnorth, with him to end my days--but (sighing)--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  But what?  Proceed, pray, to the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  But last night I slept here in town, please your worship, at the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (in a rage).  At the \"Saracen\\'s Head\"!  Yes, forsooth! none such\\r\\never slept at the \"Saracen\\'s Head\" afore, or shall afterwards, as long as\\r\\nmy name\\'s Bustle, and the \"Saracen\\'s Head\" is the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Again! again!  Mrs. Landlady, this is downright--I have said you\\r\\nshould speak presently.  He SHALL speak first, since I\\'ve said it--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!  Speak on, friend.  You slept last night at the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Yes, please your worship, and I accuse nobody; but at night I had\\r\\nmy little money safe, and in the morning it was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Gone!--gone, indeed, in my house! and this is the way I\\'m to be\\r\\ntreated!  Is it so?  I couldn\\'t but speak, your worship, to such an\\r\\ninhuman like, out o\\' the way, scandalous charge, if King George and all\\r\\nthe Royal Family were sitting in your worship\\'s chair, beside you, to\\r\\nsilence me (turning to the Old Man).  And this is your gratitude,\\r\\nforsooth!  Didn\\'t you tell me that any hole in my house was good enough\\r\\nfor you, wheedling hypocrite?  And the thanks I receive is to call me and\\r\\nmine a pack of thieves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, no, no, no, NO--a pack of thieves, by no means.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, I thought when _I_ came to speak we should have you upon your\\r\\nmarrow-bones in--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (imperiously).  Silence!  Five times have I commanded silence, and\\r\\nfive times in vain; and I won\\'t command anything five times in vain--\\r\\nTHAT\\'S POZ!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (in a pet, aside).  Old Poz! (aloud).  Then, your worship, I don\\'t\\r\\nsee any business I have to be waiting here; the folks want me at home\\r\\n(returning and whispering).  Shall I send the goose-pie up, your worship,\\r\\nif it\\'s ready?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (with magnanimity).  I care not for the goose-pie, Mrs. Bustle.\\r\\nDo not talk to me of goose-pies; this is no place to talk of pies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, for that matter, your worship knows best, to be sure.\\r\\n                                      (Exit Landlady, angry.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  JUSTICE HEADSTRONG, OLD MAN and LUCY.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ah, now, I\\'m glad he can speak; now tell papa; and you need not be\\r\\nafraid to speak to him, for he is very good-natured.  Don\\'t contradict\\r\\nhim, though, because he told ME not.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, darling, YOU shall contradict me as often as you please--only\\r\\nnot before I\\'ve drunk my chocolate, child--hey!  Go on, my good friend;\\r\\nyou see what it is to live in Old England, where, thank Heaven, the\\r\\npoorest of His Majesty\\'s subjects may have justice, and speak his mind\\r\\nbefore the first in the land.  Now speak on; and you hear she tells you\\r\\nthat you need not be afraid of me.  Speak on.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  I thank your worship, I\\'m sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Thank me! for what, sir?  I won\\'t be thanked for doing justice,\\r\\nsir; so--but explain this matter.  You lost your money, hey, at the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"?  You had it safe last night, hey?--and you missed it\\r\\nthis morning?  Are you sure you had it safe at night?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, please your worship, quite sure; for I took it out and looked\\r\\nat it just before I said my prayers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  You did--did ye so?--hum!  Pray, my good friend, where might you\\r\\nput your money when you went to bed?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, where I always put it--always--in my\\r\\ntobacco-box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Your tobacco-box!  I never heard of such a thing--to make a STRONG\\r\\nBOX of a tobacco-box.  Ha! ha! ha! hum!--and you say the box and all were\\r\\ngone in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  No, please your worship, no; not the box--the box was never\\r\\nstirred from the place where I put it.  They left me the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Tut, tut, tut, man!--took the money and left the box?  I\\'ll never\\r\\nbelieve THAT!  I\\'ll never believe that anyone could be such a fool.  Tut,\\r\\ntut! the thing\\'s impossible!  It\\'s well you are not upon oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  If I were, please your worship, I should say the same; for it is\\r\\nthe truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Don\\'t tell me, don\\'t tell me; I say the thing is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, here\\'s the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (goes on without looking at it).  Nonsense! nonsense! it\\'s no such\\r\\nthing; it\\'s no such thing, I say--no man would take the money and leave\\r\\nthe tobacco-box.  I won\\'t believe it.  Nothing shall make me believe it\\r\\never--that\\'s poz.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (takes the box, and holds it up before her father\\'s eyes).  You did\\r\\nnot see the box, did you, papa!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Yes, yes, yes, child--nonsense! it\\'s all a lie from beginning to\\r\\nend.  A man who tells one lie will tell a hundred.  All a lie! all a lie!\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  If your worship would give me leave--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Sir, it does not signify--it does not signify!  I\\'ve said it, I\\'ve\\r\\nsaid it, and that\\'s enough to convince me, and I\\'ll tell you more; if my\\r\\nLord Chief Justice of England told it to me, I would not believe it--\\r\\nthat\\'s poz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (still playing with the box).  But how comes the box here, I wonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Pshaw! pshaw! pshaw! darling.  Go to your dolls, darling, and\\r\\ndon\\'t be positive--go to your dolls, and don\\'t talk of what you don\\'t\\r\\nunderstand.  What can you understand, I want to know, of the law?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  No, papa, I didn\\'t mean about the law, but about the box; because,\\r\\nif the man had taken it, how could it be here, you know, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hey, hey, what?  Why, what I say is this, that I don\\'t dispute\\r\\nthat that box, that you hold in your hands, is a box; nay, for aught I\\r\\nknow, it may be a tobacco-box--but it\\'s clear to me that if they left the\\r\\nbox they did not take the money; and how do you dare, sir, to come before\\r\\nJustice Headstrong with a lie in your mouth; recollect yourself--I\\'ll\\r\\ngive you time to recollect yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              (A pause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, sir;, and what do you say now about the box?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, with submission, I CAN say nothing but what\\r\\nI said before.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What, contradict me again, after I gave you time to recollect\\r\\nyourself!  I\\'ve done with you; I have done.  Contradict me as often as\\r\\nyou please, but you cannot impose upon me; I defy you to impose upon me!\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Impose!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  I know the law!--I know the law!--and I\\'ll make you know it, too.\\r\\nOne hour I\\'ll give you to recollect yourself, and if you don\\'t give up\\r\\nthis idle story, I\\'ll--I\\'ll commit you as a vagrant--that\\'s poz!  Go, go,\\r\\nfor the present.  William, take him into the servants\\' hall, do you\\r\\nhear?--What, take the money and leave the box?  I\\'ll never do it--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy speaks to the Old Man as he is going off.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Don\\'t be frightened! don\\'t be frightened!--I mean, you tell the\\r\\ntruth, never be frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  IF I tell the truth--(turning up his eyes).\\r\\n                   (Old Man is still held back by the young lady.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  One moment--answer me one question--because of something that just\\r\\ncame into my head.  Was the box shut fast when you left it?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  No, miss, no!--open--it was open; for I could not find the lid in\\r\\nthe dark--my candle went out.  IF I tell the truth--oh!\\r\\n                                             (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Justice\\'s Study--the Justice is writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Well!--I shall have but few days\\' more misery in this world!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (looks up).  Why! why--why then, why will you be so positive to\\r\\npersist in a lie?  Take the money and leave the box!  Obstinate\\r\\nblockhead!  Here, William (showing the committal), take this old\\r\\ngentleman to Holdfast, the constable, and give him this warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter Lucy, running, out of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  I\\'ve found it!  I\\'ve found it!  Here, old man; here\\'s your money--\\r\\nhere it is all--a guinea and a half, and a shilling and a sixpence, just\\r\\nas he said, papa.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter LANDLADY.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh la! your worship, did you ever hear the like?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  I\\'ve heard nothing yet that I can understand.  First, have you\\r\\nsecured the thief, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (makes signs to the landlady to be silent).  Yes, yes, yes!--we have\\r\\nhim safe--we have him prisoner.  Shall he come in, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Yes, child, by all means; and now I shall hear what possessed him\\r\\nto leave the box.  I don\\'t understand--there\\'s something deep in all\\r\\nthis; I don\\'t understand it.  Now I do desire, Mrs. Landlady, nobody may\\r\\nspeak a single word whilst I am cross-examining the thief.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Landlady puts her finger upon her lips--Everybody looks eagerly towards\\r\\nthe door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-enter Lucy, with a huge wicker cage in her hand, containing a magpie--\\r\\nThe Justice drops the committal out of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hey!--what, Mrs. Landlady--the old magpie? hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, your worship, my old magpie.  Who\\'d have thought it?  Miss was\\r\\nvery clever; it was she caught the thief.  Miss was very clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Very good! very good!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ay, darling, her father\\'s own child!  How was it, child?  Caught\\r\\nthe thief, WITH THE MAINOUR, hey?  Tell us all; I will hear all--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh! then first I must tell you how I came to suspect Mr. Magpie.\\r\\nDo you remember, papa, that day last summer, when I went with you to the\\r\\nbowling-green, at the \"Saracen\\'s Head\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, of all days in the year! but I ask pardon, miss.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Well, that day I heard my uncle and another gentleman telling\\r\\nstories of magpies hiding money; and they laid a wager about this old\\r\\nmagpie and they tried him--they put a shilling upon the table, and he ran\\r\\naway with it, and hid it; so I thought that he might do so again, you\\r\\nknow, this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Right, right.  It\\'s a pity, child, you are not upon the Bench; ha!\\r\\nha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  And when I went to his old hiding place, there it was; but you\\r\\nsee, papa, he did not take the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, no, no! because the thief was a magpie.  No MAN would have\\r\\ntaken the money and left the box.  You see I was right; no MAN would have\\r\\nleft the box, hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Certainly not, I suppose; but I\\'m so very glad, old man, that you\\r\\nhave obtained your money.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well then, child, here--take my purse, and add that to it.  We\\r\\nwere a little too hasty with the committal--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, and I fear I was, too; but when one is touched about the\\r\\ncredit of one\\'s house, one\\'s apt to speak warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, I\\'m the happiest old man alive!  You are all convinced that I\\r\\ntold you no lies.  Say no more--say no more.  I am the happiest man!\\r\\nMiss, you have made me the happiest man alive!  Bless you for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Well now, I\\'ll tell you what.  I know what I think--you must keep\\r\\nthat there magpie, and make a show of him, and I warrant he\\'ll bring you\\r\\nmany an honest penny; for it\\'s a TRUE STORY, and folks would like to hear\\r\\nit, I hopes--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (eagerly).  And, friend, do you hear? you\\'ll dine here today,\\r\\nyou\\'ll dine here.  We have some excellent ale.  I will have you drink my\\r\\nhealth--that\\'s poz!--hey?  You\\'ll drink my health, won\\'t you--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  (bows).  Oh! and the young lady\\'s, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ay, ay, drink her health--she deserves it.  Ay, drink my darling\\'s\\r\\nhealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  And please your worship, it\\'s the right time, I believe, to speak\\r\\nof the goose-pie now; and a charming pie it is, and it\\'s on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  And Mr. Smack, the curate, and Squire Solid, and the doctor, sir,\\r\\nare come, and dinner is upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Then let us say no more; but do justice immediately to the goose-\\r\\npie; and, darling, put me in mind to tell this story after dinner.\\r\\n(After they go out, the Justice stops.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell this story\"--I don\\'t know whether it tells well for me; but I\\'ll\\r\\nnever be positive any more--THAT\\'S POZ!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MIMIC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with\\r\\ntheir son Frederick, and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne.  They\\r\\nhad taken much care of the education of their children; nor were they\\r\\never tempted, by any motive of personal convenience or temporary\\r\\namusement, to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nSensible of the extreme importance of early impressions, and of the\\r\\npowerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters\\r\\nand the manners, they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and\\r\\nnew objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear\\r\\nin a just point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let children see and judge for themselves,\" is often inconsiderately\\r\\nsaid.  Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole; and\\r\\nfrom the superficial view which they can have in short visits and\\r\\ndesultory conversation, they can form only a false estimate of the\\r\\nobjects of human happiness, a false notion of the nature of society, and\\r\\nfalse opinions of characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the above reasons, Mr. and Mrs. Montague were particularly cautious\\r\\nin the choice of their acquaintances, as they were well aware that\\r\\nwhatever passed in conversation before children became part of their\\r\\neducation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely to\\r\\nthemselves, but, as they came late in the season, almost all the lodging\\r\\nhouses were full, and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a\\r\\nhouse where some of the apartments were already occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of\\r\\nthe families who lodged on the same floor with them.  An elderly quaker,\\r\\nand his sister Bertha, were their silent neighbours.  The blooming\\r\\ncomplexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the\\r\\nchildren, as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into\\r\\nher carriage to go out upon the Downs.  They could scarcely believe that\\r\\nshe came to the Wells on account of her health.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides her blooming complexion, the delicate white of her garments had\\r\\nstruck them with admiration; and they observed that her brother carefully\\r\\nguarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage, as he handed her in.\\r\\nFrom this circumstance, and from the benevolent countenance of the old\\r\\ngentleman, they concluded that he was very fond of his sister, and that\\r\\nthey were certainly very happy, except that they never spoke, and could\\r\\nbe seen only for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor.  On the stairs, in\\r\\nthe passages, at her window, she was continually visible; and she\\r\\nappeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once.\\r\\nHer voice was eternally to be heard, and it was not particularly\\r\\nmelodious.  The very first day she met Mrs. Montague\\'s children on the\\r\\nstairs, she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear, and a\\r\\ncharming little dear; to kiss her, to inquire her name, and to inform her\\r\\nthat her own name was \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle,\" a circumstance of which\\r\\nthere was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance; for, in the\\r\\ncourse of one morning, at least twenty single and as many double raps at\\r\\nthe door were succeeded by vociferations of \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s\\r\\nservant!\"  \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle at home?\"   \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle not at\\r\\nhome!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than Mrs. Tattle.\\r\\nShe had, as she deemed it, the happiness to have a most extensive\\r\\nacquaintance residing at Clifton.  She had for years kept a register of\\r\\narrivals.  She regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating\\r\\nlibraries, and the lists at the Ball and the Pump-rooms:  so that, with a\\r\\nmemory unencumbered with literature, and free from all domestic cares,\\r\\nshe contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births,\\r\\ndeaths and marriages, together with all the anecdotes, amusing,\\r\\ninstructive, or scandalous, which are necessary to the conversation of a\\r\\nwater drinking place, and essential to the character of a \"very pleasant\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very pleasant woman,\" Mrs. Tattle was usually called; and, conscious\\r\\nof her accomplishments, she was eager to introduce herself to the\\r\\nacquaintance of her new neighbours; having, with her ordinary expedition,\\r\\ncollected from their servants, by means of her own, all that could be\\r\\nknown, or rather, all that could be told about them.  The name of\\r\\nMontague, at all events, she knew was a good name, and justified in\\r\\ncourting the acquaintance.  She courted it first by nods, and becks and\\r\\nsmiles at Marianne whenever she met her; and Marianne, who was a very\\r\\nlittle girl, began presently to nod and smile in return, persuaded that a\\r\\nlady who smiled so much, could not be ill-natured.  Besides, Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa\\'s parlour door was sometimes left more than half open, to afford\\r\\na view of a green parrot.  Marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this\\r\\ndoor.  One morning it was left quite wide open, when she stopped to say\\r\\n\"Pretty Poll\"; and immediately Mrs. Tattle begged she would do her the\\r\\nhonour to walk in and see \"Pretty Poll,\" at the same time taking the\\r\\nliberty to offer her a piece of iced plum-cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Mrs. Theresa Tattle did herself the honour to wait upon Mrs.\\r\\nMontague, \"to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting Mrs.\\r\\nMontague\\'s charming Miss Marianne into her apartment to see Pretty Poll,\\r\\nand for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece\\r\\nof plum-cake--inconsiderate creature that she was!--which might possibly\\r\\nhave disagreed with her, and which certainly were liberties she never\\r\\nshould have been induced to take, if she had not been unaccountably\\r\\nbewitched by Miss Marianne\\'s striking though highly flattering\\r\\nresemblance to a young gentleman (an officer) with whom she had danced,\\r\\nnow nearly twelve years ago, of the name of Montague, a most respectable\\r\\nyoung man, and of a most respectable family, with which, in a remote\\r\\ndegree, she might presume to say, she herself was someway connected,\\r\\nhaving the honour to be nearly related to the Joneses of Merionethshire,\\r\\nwho were cousins to the Mainwarings of Bedfordshire, who married into the\\r\\nfamily of the Griffiths, the eldest branch of which, she understood, had\\r\\nthe honour to be cousin-german to Mr. Montague; on which account she had\\r\\nbeen impatient to pay a visit, so likely to be productive of most\\r\\nagreeable consequences, by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose\\r\\nsociety must do her infinite honour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus happily accomplished her first visit, there seemed little\\r\\nprobability of escaping Mrs. Tattle\\'s further acquaintance.  In the\\r\\ncourse of the first week she only hinted to Mr. Montague that \"some\\r\\npeople thought his system of education rather odd; that she should be\\r\\nobliged to him if he would, some time or other, when he had nothing else\\r\\nto do, just sit down and make her understand his notions, that she might\\r\\nhave something to say to her acquaintance, as she always wished to have\\r\\nwhen she heard any friend attacked, or any friend\\'s opinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system\\r\\nof education only to give her something to say, and showing unaccountable\\r\\nindifference about the attacks with which he was threatened, Mrs. Tattle\\r\\nnext addressed herself to Mrs. Montague, prophesying, in a most serious\\r\\nwhisper, \"that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably\\r\\ngrow quite crooked, if she were not immediately provided with a back-\\r\\nboard, a French dancing-master, and a pair of stocks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis alarming whisper could not, however, have a permanent effect upon\\r\\nMrs. Montague\\'s understanding, because three days afterwards Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, upon the most anxious inspection, entirely mistook the just and\\r\\nnatural proportions of the hip and shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis danger vanishing, Mrs. Tattle presently, with a rueful length of\\r\\nface, and formal preface, \"hesitated to assure Mrs. Montague, that she\\r\\nwas greatly distressed about her daughter Sophy; that she was convinced\\r\\nher lungs were affected; and that she certainly ought to drink the waters\\r\\nmorning and evening; and above all things, must keep one of the patirosa\\r\\nlozenges constantly in her mouth, and directly consult Dr. Cardamum, the\\r\\nbest physician in the world, and the person she would send for herself\\r\\nupon her death-bed; because, to her certain knowledge, he had recovered a\\r\\nyoung lady, a relation of her own, after she had lost one whole GLOBE* of\\r\\nher lungs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*Lobe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not\\r\\nhave much weight.  Neither was this universal adviser more successful in\\r\\nan attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick, who, she apprehended, must\\r\\nwant some one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek, and dead languages,\\r\\nof which, she observed, it would be impertinent for a woman to talk; only\\r\\nshe might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority,\\r\\nthat a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a\\r\\npublic school, or else from a private tutor who had been abroad (after\\r\\nthe advantage of a classical education, finished in one of the\\r\\nuniversities) with a good family; without which introduction it was idle\\r\\nto think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour; all which\\r\\nrequisites, from personal knowledge, she could aver to be concentrated in\\r\\nthe gentleman she had the honour to recommend, as having been tutor to a\\r\\nyoung nobleman, who had now no further occasion for him, having,\\r\\nunfortunately for himself and his family, been killed in an untimely\\r\\nduel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s suggestions being lost upon these stoical\\r\\nparents, her powers were next tried upon the children, and her success\\r\\nsoon became apparent.  On Sophy, indeed, she could not make any\\r\\nimpression, though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of\\r\\nflattery.  Sophy, though very desirous of the approbation of her friends,\\r\\nwas not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers.  She was about\\r\\nthirteen--that dangerous age at which ill educated girls, in their\\r\\nanxiety to display their accomplishments, are apt to become dependent for\\r\\napplause upon the praise of every idle visitor; when the habits not being\\r\\nformed, and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners,\\r\\ngirls are apt to affect and imitate, indiscriminately, everything that\\r\\nthey conceive to be agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers\\r\\nof reasoning, was not liable to fall into these errors.  She found that\\r\\nshe could please those whom she wished to please, without affecting to be\\r\\nanything but what she really was; and her friends listened to what she\\r\\nsaid, though she never repeated the sentiments, or adopted the phrases,\\r\\nwhich she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who\\r\\nwere older or more fashionable than herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis word FASHIONABLE, Mrs. Theresa Tattle knew, had usually a great\\r\\neffect, even at thirteen; but she had not observed that it had much power\\r\\nupon Sophy; nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much\\r\\nattended to.  Her mother had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself\\r\\nalone, and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring\\r\\ngrimace, which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support, and\\r\\nwhich is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and\\r\\npoliteness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" said Mrs. Tattle, to herself, \"if I had such a tall daughter,\\r\\nand so unformed, before my eyes from morning to night, it would certainly\\r\\nbreak my poor heart.  Thank heaven, I am not a mother! if I were, Miss\\r\\nMarianne for me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marianne had heard so often from Mrs. Tattle that she was very\\r\\ncharming, that she could not help believing it; and from being a very\\r\\npleasing, unaffected little girl, she in a short time grew so conceited,\\r\\nthat she could neither speak, look, nor be silent without imagining that\\r\\neverybody was, or ought to be, looking at her; and when Mrs. Theresa saw\\r\\nthat Mrs. Montague looked very grave upon these occasions, she, to repair\\r\\nthe ill she had done, would say, after praising Marianne\\'s hair or her\\r\\neyes, \"Oh, but little ladies should never think about their beauty, you\\r\\nknow.  Nobody loves anybody for being handsome, but for being good.\"\\r\\nPeople must think children are very silly, or else they can never have\\r\\nreflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds, if they imagine\\r\\nthat children will believe the words that are said to them, by way of\\r\\nmoral, when the countenance, manner, and every concomitant circumstance\\r\\ntell them a different tale.  Children are excellent physiognomists--they\\r\\nquickly learn the universal language of looks; and what is said OF them\\r\\nalways makes a greater impression than what is said TO them, a truth of\\r\\nwhich those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves,\\r\\nand apologize to parents, by saying, \"Oh, but I would not say so and so\\r\\nto the child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Theresa had seldom said to Frederick Montague, \"that he had a vast\\r\\ndeal of drollery, and was a most incomparable mimic;\" but she had said so\\r\\nof him in whispers, which magnified the sound to his imagination, if not\\r\\nto his ear.  He was a boy of much vivacity, and had considerable\\r\\nabilities; but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited.\\r\\nEven Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s flattery pleased him, and he exerted himself\\r\\nfor her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon.  Instead of\\r\\nobserving characters and manners, that he might judge of them, and form\\r\\nhis own, he now watched every person he saw, that he might detect some\\r\\nfoible, or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation,\\r\\nwhich he might successfully mimic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlarmed by the rapid progress of these evils, Mr. and Mrs. Montague, who,\\r\\nfrom the first day that they had been honoured with Mrs. Tattle\\'s visit,\\r\\nhad begun to look out for new lodgings, were now extremely impatient to\\r\\ndecamp.  They were not people who, from the weak fear of offending a\\r\\nsilly acquaintance, would hazard the happiness of their family.  They had\\r\\nheard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them, and they\\r\\ndetermined to go directly to look at it.  As they were to be absent all\\r\\nday, they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere\\r\\nwith their children.  They did not choose to exact any promise from them\\r\\nwhich they might be tempted to break, and therefore they only said at\\r\\nparting, \"If Mrs. Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to her, do as you\\r\\nthink proper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had Mrs. Montague\\'s carriage got out of hearing when a note was\\r\\nbrought, directed to \"Frederick Montague, Junior, Esq.,\" which he\\r\\nimmediately opened, and read as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the\\r\\nentertaining Mr. Frederick Montague; she hopes he will have the charity\\r\\nto drink tea with her this evening, and bring his charming sister, Miss\\r\\nMarianne, with him, as Mrs. Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking\\r\\nheadache, and is sensible her nerves are affected; and Dr. Cardamum says\\r\\nthat (especially in Mrs. T. T.\\'s case) it is downright death to nervous\\r\\npatients to be alone an instant.  She therefore trusts Mr. Frederick will\\r\\nnot refuse to come and make her laugh.  Mrs. Theresa has taken care to\\r\\nprovide a few macaroons for her little favourite, who said she was\\r\\nparticularly fond of them the other day.  Mrs. Theresa hopes they will\\r\\nall come at six, or before, not forgetting Miss Sophy, if she will\\r\\ncondescend to be of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first reading of this note, \"the entertaining\" Mr. Frederick, and\\r\\nthe \"charming\" Miss Marianne laughed heartily, and looked at Sophy, as if\\r\\nthey were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such\\r\\ngross flattery; but upon a second perusal, Marianne observed that it\\r\\ncertainly was very good-natured of Mrs. Theresa to remember the\\r\\nmacaroons; and Frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor\\r\\nwoman because she had the headache.  Then twisting the note in his\\r\\nfingers, he appealed to Sophy:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Sophy, leave off drawing for an instant,\" said Frederick, \"and\\r\\ntell us what answer can we send?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can!--we can send what answer we please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said Frederick.  \"I would refuse if I could; but we\\r\\nought not to do anything rude, should we?  So I think we might as well\\r\\ngo, because we could not refuse, if we would, I say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have made such confusion,\" replied Sophy, \"between \\'couldn\\'t\\' and\\r\\n\\'wouldn\\'t\\' and \\'shouldn\\'t,\\' that I can\\'t understand you; surely they are\\r\\nall different things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Different! no,\" cried Frederick--\"could, would, should, might, and\\r\\nought, are all the same thing in the Latin grammar; all of \\'em signs of\\r\\nthe potential mood, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded, even by\\r\\nquotations from the Latin grammar, looked up soberly from her drawing,\\r\\nand answered \"that very likely those words might be signs of the same\\r\\nthing in the Latin grammar, but she believed that they meant perfectly\\r\\ndifferent things in real life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s just as people please,\" said her sophistical brother.  \"You know\\r\\nwords mean nothing in themselves.  If I choose to call my hat my\\r\\ncadwallader, you would understand me just as well, after I had once\\r\\nexplained it to you, that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I\\r\\nput upon my head; cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing\\r\\nto you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why have two words for the same thing?\" said Sophy; \"and what has\\r\\nthis to do with \\'could\\' and \\'should\\'?  You wanted to prove--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted to prove,\" interrupted Frederick, \"that it\\'s not worth while to\\r\\ndispute for two hours about two words.  Do keep to the point, Sophy, and\\r\\ndon\\'t dispute with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not disputing, I was reasoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, reasoning or disputing.  Women have no business to do either; for,\\r\\nhow should they know how to chop logic like men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex, Sophy\\'s colour rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There!\" cried Frederick, exulting, \"now we shall see a philosopheress in\\r\\na passion; I\\'d give sixpence, half-price, for a harlequin entertainment,\\r\\nto see Sophy in a passion.  Now, Marianne, look at her brush dabbing so\\r\\nfast in the water!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, who could not easily bear to be laughed at, with some little\\r\\nindignation, said, \"Brother, I wish--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There! there!\" cried Frederick, pointing to the colour which rose in her\\r\\ncheeks almost to her temples--\"rising! rising! rising! look at the\\r\\nthermometer! blood heat! blood! fever heat! boiling water heat!\\r\\nMarianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Sophy, smiling, \"you should stand a little farther off, both\\r\\nof you.  Leave the thermometer to itself a little while.  Give it time to\\r\\ncool.  It will come down to \\'temperate\\' by the time you look again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, brother!\" cried Marianne, \"she\\'s so good-humoured, don\\'t tease her\\r\\nany more, and don\\'t draw heads upon her paper, and don\\'t stretch her\\r\\nindia-rubber, and don\\'t let us dirty any more of her brushes.  See! the\\r\\nsides of her tumbler are all manner of colours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I only mixed red, blue, green and yellow, to show you, Marianne,\\r\\nthat all colours mixed together make white.  But she is temperate now,\\r\\nand I won\\'t plague her; she shall chop logic, if she likes it, though she\\r\\nis a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s not fair, brother,\" said Marianne, \"to say \\'woman\\' in that\\r\\nway.  I\\'m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot, which papa\\r\\nshowed us yesterday, long before you did, though you are a man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not long,\" said Frederick.  \"Besides, that was only a conjuring trick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very ingenious, though,\" said Marianne; \"and papa said so.\\r\\nBesides, she understood the \\'Rule of Three,\\' which was no conjuring\\r\\ntrick, better than you did, though she is a woman; and she can reason,\\r\\ntoo, mamma says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, let her reason away,\" said the provoking wit.  \"All I have to\\r\\nsay is, that she\\'ll never be able to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, pray, brother?\" inquired Sophy, looking up again, very gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you know papa himself, the other day at dinner, said that the woman\\r\\nwho talks Greek and Latin as well as I do, is a fool after all; and that\\r\\nshe had better have learned something useful; and Mrs. Tattle said, she\\'d\\r\\nanswer for it she did not know how to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! but I am not talking Greek and Latin, am I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but you are drawing, and that\\'s the same thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same thing!  Oh, Frederick!\" said little Marianne, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may laugh; but I say it is the same sort of thing.  Women who are\\r\\nalways drawing and reasoning, never know how to make puddings.  Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa Tattle said so, when I showed her Sophy\\'s beautiful drawing\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Theresa Tattle might say so,\" replied Sophy, calmly; \"but I do not\\r\\nperceive the reason, brother, why drawing should prevent me from learning\\r\\nhow to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I say you\\'ll never learn how to make a good pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have learned,\" continued Sophy, who was mixing her colours, \"to mix\\r\\nsuch and such colours together to make the colour that I want; and why\\r\\nshould I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter, and sugar and egg,\\r\\ntogether, to produce the taste that I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but mixing will never do, unless you know the quantities, like a\\r\\ncook; and you would never learn the right quantities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did the cook learn them?  Cannot I learn them as she did?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you\\'d never do it exactly, and mind the spoonfuls right, by the\\r\\nrecipe, like a cook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! indeed! but she would,\" cried Marianne, eagerly:  \"and a great\\r\\ndeal more exactly, for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things\\r\\nvery carefully:  and when I was ill she always weighed the bark in\\r\\nnicely, and dropped my drops so carefully:  better than the cook.  When\\r\\nmamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once, I saw her spoonfuls,\\r\\nand her ounces, and her handfuls:  she dashed and splashed without\\r\\nminding exactness or the recipe, or anything.  I\\'m sure Sophy would make\\r\\na much better pudding, if exactness only were wanting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world,\\r\\nwhat does that signify?  I say she never would:  so it comes to the same\\r\\nthing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, now look at her, with her books, and her drawings, and all this\\r\\napparatus.  Do you think she would ever jump up, with all her nicety,\\r\\ntoo, and put by all these things, to go down into the greasy kitchen, and\\r\\nplump up to the elbows in suet, like a cook, for a plum-pudding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I need not plump up to the elbows, brother,\" said Sophy, smiling:  \"nor\\r\\nis it necessary that I should be a cook:  but, if it were necessary, I\\r\\nhope I should be able to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried Marianne, warmly; \"and she would jump up, and put by\\r\\nall her things in a minute if it were necessary, and run down stairs and\\r\\nup again like lightning, or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to\\r\\nher, even about the suet, with all her nicety, brother, I assure you, as\\r\\nshe used to do anything, everything for me, when I was ill last winter.\\r\\nOh, brother, she can do anything; and she could make the best plum-\\r\\npudding in the whole world, I\\'m sure, in a minute, if it were necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nA knock at the door, from Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s servant, recalled\\r\\nMarianne to the business of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" said Frederick, \"we have sent no answer all this time.  It\\'s\\r\\nnecessary to think of that in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant came with his mistress\\' compliments, to let the young ladies\\r\\nand Mr. Frederick know that she was waiting tea for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waiting! then we must go,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant opened the door wider, to let him pass, and Marianne thought\\r\\nshe must follow her brother:  so they went downstairs together, while\\r\\nSophy gave her own message to the servant, and quietly stayed at her\\r\\nusual occupations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Tattle was seated at her tea-table, with a large plate of macaroons\\r\\nbeside her when Frederick and Marianne entered.  She was \"delighted\" they\\r\\nwere come, and \"grieved\" not to see Miss Sophy along with them.  Marianne\\r\\ncoloured a little; for though she had precipitately followed her brother,\\r\\nand though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying \"You know\\r\\npapa and mamma told us to do what we thought best,\" yet she did not feel\\r\\nquite pleased with herself:  and it was not till after Mrs. Theresa had\\r\\nexhausted all her compliments, and half her macaroons, that she could\\r\\nrestore her spirits to their usual height.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Frederick,\" said she after tea, \"you promised to make me\\r\\nlaugh; and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, brother,\" said Marianne, \"show Mrs. Theresa Dr. Carbuncle eating his\\r\\ndinner; and I\\'ll be Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne.  Now, my dear, what shall I help you to?\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick. \"My dear!\" she never calls him my dear, you know, but always\\r\\nDoctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Well then, doctor, what will you eat to-day?\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Eat, madam! eat! nothing! nothing!  I don\\'t see anything here I\\r\\ncan eat, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Here\\'s eels, sir; let me help you to some eel--stewed eel;--you\\r\\nused to be fond of stewed eel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Used, ma\\'am, used!  But I\\'m sick of stewed eels.  You would tire\\r\\none of anything.  Am I to see nothing but eels?  And what\\'s this at the\\r\\nbottom?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Mutton, doctor, roast mutton; if you\\'ll be so good as to cut it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Cut it, ma\\'am!  I can\\'t cut it, I say; it\\'s as hard as a deal\\r\\nboard.  You might as well tell me to cut the table, ma\\'am.  Mutton,\\r\\nindeed! not a bit of fat.  Roast mutton, indeed! not a drop of gravy.\\r\\nMutton, truly! quite a cinder.  I\\'ll have none of it.  Here, take it\\r\\naway; take it downstairs to the cook.  It\\'s a very hard case, Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle, that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my\\r\\nown table, Mrs. Carbuncle, since I was married, ma\\'am, I that am the\\r\\neasiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner.  It\\'s really\\r\\nvery extraordinary, Mrs. Carbuncle!  What have you at that corner there,\\r\\nunder the cover?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Patties, sir; oyster patties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Patties, ma\\'am! kickshaws!  I hate kickshaws.  Not worth putting\\r\\nunder a cover, ma\\'am.  And why not have glass covers, that one may see\\r\\none\\'s dinner before one, before it grows cold with asking questions, Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle, and lifting up covers?  But nobody has any sense:  and I see\\r\\nno water plates anywhere, lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Do, pray, doctor, let me help you to a bit of chicken before it\\r\\ngets cold, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred. (aside).  \"My dear,\" again, Marianne!\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Yes, brother, because she is frightened, you know, and Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle always says \"my dear\" to him when she\\'s frightened, and looks\\r\\nso pale from side to side; and sometimes she cries before dinner\\'s done,\\r\\nand then all the company are quite silent, and don\\'t know what to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, such a little creature; to have so much sense, too!\" exclaimed Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, with rapture.  \"Mr. Frederick, you\\'ll make me die with laughing!\\r\\nPray go on, Dr. Carbuncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Well, ma\\'am, then if I must eat something, send me a bit of fowl;\\r\\na leg and wing, the liver wing, and a bit of the breast, oyster sauce,\\r\\nand a slice of that ham, if you please, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dr. Carbuncle eats voraciously, with his head down to his plate, and,\\r\\ndropping the sauce, he buttons up his coat tight across the breast.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Here; a plate, knife and fork, bit o\\' bread, a glass of Dorchester\\r\\nale!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, admirable!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, clapping her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, brother, suppose that it is after dinner,\" said Marianne; \"and show\\r\\nus how the doctor goes to sleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick threw himself back in an arm-chair, leaning his head back, with\\r\\nhis mouth open, snoring; nodded from time to time, crossed and uncrossed\\r\\nhis legs, tried to awake himself by twitching his wig, settling his\\r\\ncollar, blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff-box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll which infinitely diverted Mrs. Tattle, who, when she could stop\\r\\nherself from laughing, declared \"It made her sigh, too, to think of the\\r\\nlife poor Mrs. Carbuncle led with that man, and all for nothing, too; for\\r\\nher jointure was nothing, next to nothing, though a great thing, to be\\r\\nsure, her friends thought for her, when she was only Sally Ridgeway\\r\\nbefore she was married.  Such a wife as she makes,\" continued Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven, \"and so much as she has\\r\\ngone through, the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not\\r\\nleave her something extraordinary in his will; for turn it which way she\\r\\nwill, she can never keep a carriage, or live like anybody else, on her\\r\\njointure, after all, she tells me, poor soul!  A sad prospect, after her\\r\\nhusband\\'s death, to look forward to, instead of being comfortable, as her\\r\\nfriends expected; and she, poor young thing! knowing no better when they\\r\\nmarried her!  People should look into these things, beforehand, or never\\r\\nmarry at all, I say, Miss Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marianne, who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the\\r\\njointure, or the reason why Mrs. Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her\\r\\nhusband\\'s death, turned to Frederick, who was at that instant studying\\r\\nMrs. Theresa as a future character to mimic.  \"Brother,\" said Marianne,\\r\\n\"now sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker.  Pray, Miss Croker,\\r\\nfavour us with a song.  Mrs. Theresa Tattle has never had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing you sing; she\\'s quite impatient to hear you sing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, I am,\" said Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick put his hands before him affectedly; \"Oh, indeed, ma\\'am!\\r\\nindeed, ladies! I really am so hoarse, it distresses me so to be pressed\\r\\nto sing; besides, upon my word, I have quite left off singing.  I\\'ve\\r\\nnever sung once, except for very particular people, this winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  But Mrs. Theresa Tattle is a very particular person.  I\\'m sure\\r\\nyou\\'ll sing for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Certainly, ma\\'am, I allow that you use a powerful argument; but I\\r\\nassure you now, I would do my best to oblige you, but I absolutely have\\r\\nforgotten all my English songs.  Nobody hears anything but Italian now,\\r\\nand I have been so giddy as to leave my Italian music behind me.\\r\\nBesides, I make it a rule never to hazard myself without an\\r\\naccompaniment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Oh, try, Miss Croker, for once.\\r\\n\\r\\n              [Frederick sings, after much preluding.]\\r\\n\\r\\n     Violante in the pantry,\\r\\n     Gnawing of a mutton-bone;\\r\\n          How she gnawed it,\\r\\n          How she claw\\'d it,\\r\\n     When she found herself alone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charming!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle; \"so like Miss Croker, I\\'m sure I shall\\r\\nthink of you, Mr. Frederick, when I hear her asked to sing again.  Her\\r\\nvoice, however, introduces her to very pleasant parties, and she\\'s a girl\\r\\nthat\\'s very much taken notice of, and I don\\'t doubt will go off vastly\\r\\nwell.  She\\'s a particular favourite of mine, you must know; and I mean to\\r\\ndo her a piece of service the first opportunity, by saying something or\\r\\nother, that shall go round to her relations in Northumberland, and make\\r\\nthem do something for her; as well they may, for they are all rolling in\\r\\ngold, and won\\'t give her a penny.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Now, brother, read the newspaper like Counsellor Puff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pray do, Mr. Frederick, for I declare I admire you of all things!\\r\\nYou are quite yourself to-night.  Here\\'s a newspaper, sir, pray let us\\r\\nhave Counsellor Puff.  It\\'s not late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n            [Frederick reads in a pompous voice.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament\\r\\nin either sex, Messrs. Valiant and Wise conceive it to be their duty to\\r\\ntake the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of\\r\\nGreat Britain in general, and their friends in particular, that they have\\r\\nnow ready for sale, as usual, at the Hippocrates\\' Head, a fresh\\r\\nassortment of new-invented, much admired, primrose soap.  To prevent\\r\\nimpositions and counterfeits, the public are requested to take notice,\\r\\nthat the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside, \\'Valiant\\r\\nand Wise.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you most incomparable mimic! \\'tis absolutely the counsellor himself.\\r\\nI absolutely must show you, some day, to my friend Lady Battersby; you\\'d\\r\\nabsolutely make her die with laughing; and she\\'d quite adore you,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Theresa, who was well aware that every pause must be filled with\\r\\nflattery.  \"Pray go on, pray go on.  I shall never be tired, if I sit\\r\\nlooking at you these hundred years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStimulated by these plaudits, Frederick proceeded to show how Colonel\\r\\nEpaulette blew his nose, flourished his cambric handkerchief, bowed to\\r\\nLady Diana Periwinkle, and admired her work, saying, \"Done by no hands,\\r\\nas you may guess, but those of Fairly Fair.\"  Whilst Lady Diana, he\\r\\nobserved, simpered so prettily, and took herself so quietly for Fairly\\r\\nFair, not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the\\r\\nwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext to Colonel Epaulette, Frederick, at Marianne\\'s particular desire,\\r\\ncame into the room like Sir Charles Slang.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, brother,\" cried she, \"your hand down to the very bottom of\\r\\nyour pocket, and your other shoulder up to your ear; but you are not\\r\\nquite wooden enough, and you should walk as if your hip were out of\\r\\njoint.  There now, Mrs. Tattle, are not those good eyes?  They stare so\\r\\nlike his, without seeming to see anything all the while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! admirable! Mr. Frederick.  I must say that you are the best\\r\\nmimic of your age I ever saw, and I\\'m sure Lady Battersby will think so\\r\\ntoo.  That is Sir Charles to the very life.  But with all that, you must\\r\\nknow he\\'s a mighty pleasant, fashionable young man when you come to know\\r\\nhim, and has a great deal of sense under all that, and is of a very good\\r\\nfamily--the Slangs, you know.  Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune\\r\\nhimself next year, if he can keep clear of gambling, which I hear is his\\r\\nfoible, poor young man!  Pray go on.  I interrupt you, Mr. Frederick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, brother,\" said Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Marianne, I can do no more.  I\\'m quite tired, and I will do no\\r\\nmore,\" said Frederick, stretching himself at full length upon a sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the midst of laughter, and whilst the voice of flattery yet\\r\\nsounded in his ear, Frederick felt sad, displeased with himself, and\\r\\ndisgusted with Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a deep sigh was there!\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"what can make you sigh\\r\\nso bitterly?  You, who make everybody else laugh.  Oh, such another sigh\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne,\" cried Frederick, \"do you remember the man in the mask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What man in the mask, brother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man--the actor--the buffoon, that my father told us of, who used to\\r\\ncry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cry! bless me,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"mighty odd! very extraordinary! but\\r\\none can\\'t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst\\r\\nthat race of people, actors by profession, you know; for they are brought\\r\\nup from the egg to make their fortune, or at least their bread by their\\r\\noddities.  But, my dear Mr. Frederick, you are quite pale, quite\\r\\nexhausted; no wonder--what will you have? a glass of cowslip-wine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh yes; indeed you must not leave me without taking something; and Miss\\r\\nMarianne must have another macaroon.  I insist upon it,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, ringing the bell.  \"It is not late, and my man Christopher will\\r\\nbring up the cowslip-wine in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Sophy! and papa and mamma, you know, will come home presently,\"\\r\\nsaid Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Miss Sophy has her books and drawings.  You know she\\'s never afraid\\r\\nof being alone.  Besides, to-night it was her own choice.  And as to your\\r\\npapa and mamma, they won\\'t be home to-night, I\\'m pretty sure; for a\\r\\ngentleman, who had it from their own authority, told me where they were\\r\\ngoing, which is further off than they think; but they did not consult me;\\r\\nand I fancy they\\'ll be obliged to sleep out; so you need not be in a\\r\\nhurry about them.  We\\'ll have candles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened just as Mrs. Tattle was going to ring the bell again for\\r\\ncandles and the cowslip-wine.  \"Christopher! Christopher!\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, who was standing at the fire, with her back to the door, when it\\r\\nopened, \"Christopher! pray bring--Do you hear?\" but no Christopher\\r\\nanswered; and, upon turning round, Mrs. Tattle, instead of Christopher,\\r\\nbeheld two little black figures, which stood perfectly still and silent.\\r\\nIt was so dark, that their forms could scarcely be discerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of heaven, who and what may you be?  Speak, I conjure you!\\r\\nwhat are ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimney-sweepers, ma\\'am, an\\' please your ladyship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chimney-sweepers!\" repeated Frederick and Marianne, bursting out a-\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chimney-sweepers!\" repeated Mrs. Theresa, provoked at the recollection\\r\\nof her late solemn address to them.  \"Chimney-sweepers! and could not you\\r\\nsay so a little sooner?  Pray, what brings you here, gentlemen, at this\\r\\ntime of night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bell rang, ma\\'am,\", answered a squeaking voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bell rang! yes, for Christopher.  The boy\\'s mad, or drunk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" said the tallest of the chimney-sweepers, who had not yet\\r\\nspoken, and who now began in a very blunt manner; \"ma\\'am, your brother\\r\\ndesired us to come up when the bell rang; so we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother?  I have no brother, dunce,\" said Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Eden, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho, ho!\" said Mrs. Tattle, in a more complacent tone, \"the boy takes me\\r\\nfor Miss Bertha Eden, I perceive\"; and, flattered to be taken in the dark\\r\\nby a chimney-sweeper for a young and handsome lady, Mrs. Theresa laughed,\\r\\nand informed him \"that they had mistaken the room; and they must go up\\r\\nanother pair of stairs, and turn to the left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chimney-sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed, thanked her ladyship\\r\\nfor this information, said, \"Good night to ye, quality\"; and they both\\r\\nmoved towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" said Mrs. Tattle, whose curiosity was excited; \"what can the\\r\\nEdens want with chimney-sweepers at this time o\\' night, I wonder?\\r\\nChristopher, did you hear anything about it?\" said the lady to her\\r\\nfootman, who was now lighting the candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, ma\\'am,\" said the servant, \"I can\\'t say; but I\\'ll step down\\r\\nbelow and inquire.  I heard them talking about it in the kitchen; but I\\r\\nonly got a word here and there, for I was hunting for the snuff-dish, as\\r\\nI knew it must be for candles when I heard the bell ring, ma\\'am; so I\\r\\nthought to find the snuff-dish before I answered the bell, for I knew it\\r\\nmust be for candles you rang.  But, if you please, I\\'ll step down now,\\r\\nma\\'am, and see about the chimney-sweepers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, step down, do; and, Christopher, bring up the cowslip-wine, and\\r\\nsome more macaroons for my little Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs. Tattle was going\\r\\nto give her; for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which\\r\\nthis lady talked to her footman.  She had not been accustomed to these\\r\\nfamiliarities in her father and mother, and she did not like them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Tattle to Christopher, who was now returned, \"what is\\r\\nthe news?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am, the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me\\r\\nthe whole story.  The other morning, ma\\'am, early, he and the other were\\r\\ndown the hill sweeping in Paradise Row.  Those chimneys, they say, are\\r\\ndifficult; and the square fellow, ma\\'am, the biggest of the two boys, got\\r\\nwedged in the chimney.  The other little fellow was up at the top at the\\r\\ntime, and he heard the cry; but in his fright, and all, he did not know\\r\\nwhat to do, ma\\'am; for he looked about from the top of the chimney, and\\r\\nnot a soul could he see stirring, but a few that he could not make attend\\r\\nto his screech; the boy within almost stifling too.  So he screeched, and\\r\\nscreeched, all he could; and by the greatest chance in life, ma\\'am, old\\r\\nMr. Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" interrupted Mrs. Theresa, \"friend Ephraim is one of your early\\r\\nrisers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Marianne, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, ma\\'am, hearing the screech, he turns and sees the sweep; and at once\\r\\nhe understands the matter--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure he must have taken some time to understand it,\" interposed Mrs.\\r\\nTattle, \"for he\\'s the slowest creature breathing, and the deafest in\\r\\ncompany.  Go on, Christopher.  So the sweep did make him hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So he says, ma\\'am; and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy\\r\\nout of the chimney, with much ado, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa; \"but did old Eden go up the chimney\\r\\nhimself after the boy, wig and all?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, ma\\'am,\" said Christopher, with a look of great delight, \"that was\\r\\nall as one, as the very \\'dentical words I put to the boy myself, when he\\r\\ntelled me his story.  But, ma\\'am, that was what I couldn\\'t get out of\\r\\nhim, neither, rightly, for he is a churl--the big boy that was stuck in\\r\\nthe chimney, I mean; for when I put the question to him about the wig,\\r\\nlaughing like, he wouldn\\'t take it laughing like at all; but would only\\r\\nmake answer to us like a bear, \\'He saved my life, that\\'s all I know\\'; and\\r\\nthis over again, ma\\'am, to all the kitchen round, that cross-questioned\\r\\nhim.  But I finds him stupid and ill-mannered like, for I offered him a\\r\\nshilling, ma\\'am, myself, to tell about the wig; but he put it back in a\\r\\nway that did not become such as he, to no lady\\'s butler, ma\\'am; whereupon\\r\\nI turns to the slim fellow (and he\\'s smarterer, and more mannerly, ma\\'am,\\r\\nwith a tongue in his head for his betters), but he could not resolve me\\r\\nmy question either; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part\\r\\no\\' the time:  and when he came down Mr. Eden had his wig on, but had his\\r\\narm all bare and bloody, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Mr. Eden!\" exclaimed Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, miss,\" continued the servant, \"and the chimney-sweep himself was so\\r\\nbruised, and must have been killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well! but he\\'s alive now; go on with your story, Christopher,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. T.  \"Chimney-sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day; it\\'s\\r\\npart of their trade, and it\\'s a happy thing when they come off with a few\\r\\nbruises.*  To be sure,\" added she, observing that both Frederick and\\r\\nMarianne looked displeased at this speech, \"to be sure, if one may\\r\\nbelieve this story, there was some real danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*This atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping\\r\\nmachines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Real danger! yes, indeed,\" said Marianne; \"and I\\'m sure I think Mr. Eden\\r\\nwas very good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly it was a most commendable action, and quite providential.  So\\r\\nI shall take an opportunity of saying, when I tell the story in all\\r\\ncompanies; and the boy may thank his kind stars, I\\'m sure, to the end of\\r\\nhis days, for such an escape--But pray, Christopher,\" said she,\\r\\npersisting in her conversation with Christopher, who was now laying the\\r\\ncloth for supper, \"pray, which house was it in Paradise Row? where the\\r\\nEagles or the Miss Ropers lodge? or which?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was at my Lady Battersby\\'s, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! ha!\" cried Mrs. Theresa, \"I thought we should get to the bottom of\\r\\nthe affair at last.  This is excellent!  This will make an admirable\\r\\nstory for my Lady Battersby the next time I see her.  These Quakers are\\r\\nso sly!  Old Eden, I know, has long wanted to obtain an introduction into\\r\\nthat house; and a charming charitable expedient hit upon!  My Lady\\r\\nBattersby will enjoy this, of all things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" continued Mrs. Theresa, turning to Frederick, as soon as the\\r\\nservant had left the room, \"now, Mr. Frederick Montague, I have a favour-\\r\\n-such a favour--to ask of you; it\\'s a favour which only you can grant;\\r\\nyou have such talents, and would do the thing so admirably; and my Lady\\r\\nBattersby would quite adore you for it.  She will do me the honour to be\\r\\nhere to spend an evening to-morrow.  I\\'m convinced Mr. and Mrs. Montague\\r\\nwill find themselves obliged to stay out another day, and I so long to\\r\\nshow you off to her ladyship; and your Doctor Carbuncle, and your\\r\\nCounsellor Puff, and your Miss Croker, and all your charming characters.\\r\\nYou must let me introduce you to her ladyship to-morrow evening.  Promise\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick, \"I cannot promise you any such thing,\\r\\nindeed.  I am much obliged to you; but indeed I cannot come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, my dear sir? why not?  You don\\'t think I mean you should\\r\\npromise, if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they do come home, I will ask them about it,\" said Frederick,\\r\\nhesitating; for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation, he\\r\\nhad not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask them!\" repeated Mrs. Theresa.  \"My dear sir, at your age, must you\\r\\nask your papa and mamma about such things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must! no, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick; \"but I said I would.  I know I need\\r\\nnot, because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost\\r\\nabout everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And about this, I am sure,\" cried Marianne.  \"Papa and mamma, you know,\\r\\njust as they were going away, said, \\'If Mrs. Theresa asks you to come, do\\r\\nas you think best\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"you know it rests with yourselves, if\\r\\nyou may do as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I may, madam,\" said Frederick, colouring from that species of\\r\\nemotion which is justly called false shame, and which often conquers real\\r\\nshame; \"to be sure, ma\\'am, I may do as I please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I may make sure of you,\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"for now it would be\\r\\ndownright rudeness to tell a lady you won\\'t do as she pleases.  Mr.\\r\\nFrederick Montague, I\\'m sure, is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so\\r\\nunpolite, so ungallant a thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly\\r\\nacquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear\\r\\ngood sense.  A new and unintelligible system is presented to them, in a\\r\\nlanguage foreign to their understanding, and contradictory to their\\r\\nfeelings.  They hesitate between new motives and old principles.  From\\r\\nthe fear of being thought ignorant, they become affected; and from the\\r\\ndread of being thought to be children act like fools.  But all this they\\r\\nfeel only when they are in the company of such people as Mrs. Theresa\\r\\nTattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" Frederick began, \"I don\\'t mean to be rude; but I hope you\\'ll\\r\\nexcuse me from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow, because my father\\r\\nand mother are not acquainted with Lady Battersby, and maybe they might\\r\\nnot like--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, take care,\" said Mrs. Theresa, laughing at his perplexity:\\r\\n\"you want to get off from obliging me, and you don\\'t know how.  You had\\r\\nvery nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor Lady\\r\\nBattersby.  Now you know it\\'s impossible that Mr. and Mrs. Montague could\\r\\nhave in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my Lady\\r\\nBattersby at my own house; for, don\\'t you know, that, besides her\\r\\nladyship\\'s many unquestionable qualities, which one need not talk of, she\\r\\nis cousin, but once removed, to the Trotters of Lancashire--your mother\\'s\\r\\ngreat favourites?  And there is not a person at the Wells, I\\'ll venture\\r\\nto say, could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy, in the way of\\r\\npartners, when she comes to go the balls, which it\\'s to be supposed she\\r\\nwill, some time or other; and as you are so good a brother, that\\'s a\\r\\nthing to be looked to, you know.  Besides, as to yourself, there\\'s\\r\\nnothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic; and she\\'ll\\r\\nquite adore you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t want her to adore me, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick, bluntly; then,\\r\\ncorrecting himself, added, \"I mean for being a mimic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, my love?  Between friends, can there be any harm in showing\\r\\none\\'s talents?  You that have such talents to show.  She\\'ll keep your\\r\\nsecret, I\\'ll answer for her; and,\" added she, \"you needn\\'t be afraid of\\r\\nher criticism; for, between you and me, she\\'s no great critic; so you\\'ll\\r\\ncome.  Well, thank you, that\\'s settled.  How you have made me beg and\\r\\npray! but you know your own value, I see; as you entertaining people\\r\\nalways do.  One must ask a wit, like a fine singer, so often.  Well, but\\r\\nnow for the favour I was going to ask you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick looked surprised; for he thought that the favour of his company\\r\\nwas what she meant:  but she explained herself farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to the old Quaker who lodges above, old Ephraim Eden--my Lady\\r\\nBattersby and I have so much diversion about him.  He is the best\\r\\ncharacter, the oddest creature!  If you were but to see him come into the\\r\\nrooms with those stiff skirts, or walking with his eternal sister Bertha,\\r\\nand his everlasting broad-brimmed hat!  One knows him a mile off!  But\\r\\nthen his voice and way, and altogether, if one could get them to the\\r\\nlife, they\\'d be better than anything on the stage; better even than\\r\\nanything I\\'ve seen to-night; and I think you\\'d make a capital Quaker for\\r\\nmy Lady Battersby; but then the thing is, one can never get to hear the\\r\\nold quiz talk.  Now you, who have so much invention and cleverness--I\\r\\nhave no invention myself; but could you not hit upon some way of seeing\\r\\nhim, so that you might get him by heart?  I\\'m sure you, who are so quick,\\r\\nwould only want to see him, and hear him, for half a minute, to be able\\r\\nto take him off, so as to kill one with laughing.  But I have no\\r\\ninvention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, as to the invention,\" said Frederick, \"I know an admirable way of\\r\\ndoing the thing, if that is all; but then remember, I don\\'t say I will do\\r\\nthe thing, for I will not.  But I know a way of getting up into his room,\\r\\nand seeing him, without his knowing me to be there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, tell it me, you charming, clever creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, remember, I do not say I will do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, let us hear it; and you shall do as you please afterwards.\\r\\nMerciful goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, \"do my ears deceive me?  I\\r\\ndeclare I looked round, and thought I heard the squeaking chimney-sweeper\\r\\nwas in the room!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So did I, Frederick, I declare,\" cried Marianne, laughing, \"I never\\r\\nheard anything so like his voice in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney-sweeper to great\\r\\nperfection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" continued he, \"this fellow is just my height.  The old Quaker, if\\r\\nmy face were blackened, and if I were to change clothes with the chimney-\\r\\nsweeper, I\\'ll answer for it, would never know me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s an admirable invention!  I give you infinite credit for it!\"\\r\\nexclaimed Mrs. Theresa.  \"It shall, it must be done.  I\\'ll ring, and have\\r\\nthe fellow up this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; do not ring,\" said Frederick, stopping her hand, \"I don\\'t mean\\r\\nto do it.  You know you promised that I should do as I pleased.  I only\\r\\ntold you my invention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well; but only let me ring, and ask whether the chimney-sweepers\\r\\nare below.  You shall do as you please afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christopher, shut the door.  Christopher,\" said she to the servant who\\r\\ncame up when she rang, \"pray are the sweeps gone yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have they been up to old Eden yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, ma\\'am; nor be not to go till the bell rings; for Miss Bertha,\\r\\nma\\'am, was asleep a-lying down, and her brother wouldn\\'t have her wakened\\r\\non no account whatsomever.  He came down hisself to the kitchen to the\\r\\nsweeps, though; but wouldn\\'t have, as I heard him say, his sister waked\\r\\nfor no account.  But Miss Bertha\\'s bell will ring when she wakens for the\\r\\nsweeps, ma\\'am.  \\'Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved, and\\r\\nI suppose sent for him to give him something charitable, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, never mind your suppositions,\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"run down this\\r\\nvery minute to the little squeaking chimney-sweep, and send him up to me.\\r\\nQuick, but don\\'t let the other bear come up with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher, who had curiosity, as well as his mistress, when he returned\\r\\nwith the chimney-sweeper, prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping\\r\\nthe hearth, throwing down the tongs and shovel, and picking them up\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will do, Christopher!  Christopher, that will do, I say,\" Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa repeated in vain.  She was obliged to say, \"Christopher, you may\\r\\ngo,\" before he would depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she to Frederick, \"step in here to the next room with this\\r\\ncandle, and you\\'ll be equipped in an instant.  Only just change clothes\\r\\nwith the boy; only just let me see what a charming chimney-sweeper you\\'d\\r\\nmake. You shall do as you please afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll only change clothes with him, just to show you for one\\r\\nminute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Marianne to Mrs. Theresa whilst Frederick was changing his\\r\\nclothes, \"I think Frederick is right about--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About what, love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think he is in the right not to go up, though he can do it so easily,\\r\\nto see that gentleman; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him\\r\\nafterwards.  I don\\'t think that would be quite right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, pray, Miss Marianne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, because he is so good-natured to his sister.  He would not let her\\r\\nbe wakened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, it\\'s easy to be good in such little things; and he won\\'t have long\\r\\nto be good to her neither; for I don\\'t think she will trouble him long in\\r\\nthis world, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she\\'ll die, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Die! die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks!  How sorry her poor,\\r\\npoor brother will be!  But she will not die, I\\'m sure, for she walks\\r\\nabout and runs upstairs so lightly!  Oh, you must be quite mistaken, I\\r\\nhope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I\\'m mistaken, Dr. Panado Cardamum\\'s mistaken too, then, that\\'s my\\r\\ncomfort.  He says, unless the waters work a miracle, she stands a bad\\r\\nchance; and she won\\'t follow my advice, and consult the doctor for her\\r\\nhealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would frighten her to death, perhaps,\" said Marianne.  \"I hope\\r\\nFrederick won\\'t go up to disturb her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lud, child, you are turned simpleton all of a sudden; how can your\\r\\nbrother disturb her more than the real chimney-sweeper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think it\\'s right,\" persisted Marianne, \"and I shall tell him\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Miss Marianne, I don\\'t commend you now.  Young ladies should not be\\r\\nso forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked;\\r\\nand I presume that Mr. Frederick and I must know what\\'s right as well as\\r\\nMiss Marianne.  Hush! here he is.  Oh, the capital figure!\" cried Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa.  \"Bravo, bravo!\" cried she, as Frederick entered in the chimney-\\r\\nsweeper\\'s dress; and as he spoke, saying, \"I\\'m afraid, please your\\r\\nladyship, to dirt your ladyship\\'s carpet,\" she broke out into immoderate\\r\\nraptures, calling him \"her charming chimney-sweeper!\" and repeating that\\r\\nshe knew beforehand the character would do for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Theresa instantly rang the bell, in spite of all expostulation--\\r\\nordered Christopher to send up the other chimney-sweeper--triumphed in\\r\\nobserving that Christopher did not know Frederick when he came into the\\r\\nroom; and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney-sweeper would\\r\\nmistake him for his companion.  And so he did; and when Frederick spoke,\\r\\nthe voice was so very like, that it was scarcely possible that he should\\r\\nhave perceived the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was diverted by this scene; but she started, when in the midst\\r\\nof it they heard a bell ring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the lady\\'s bell, and we must go,\" said the blunt chimney-sweeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, then, about your business,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"and here\\'s a\\r\\nshilling for you, to drink, my honest fellow.  I did not know you were so\\r\\nmuch bruised when I first saw you.  I won\\'t detain you.  Go,\" said she,\\r\\npushing Frederick towards the door.  Marianne sprang forward to speak to\\r\\nhim; but Mrs. Theresa kept her off; and, though Frederick resisted, the\\r\\nlady shut the door upon him by superior force, and, having locked it,\\r\\nthere was no retreat.  Mrs. Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for\\r\\nFrederick\\'s return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hear them,\" cried Marianne, \"I hear them coming downstairs.\"  They\\r\\nlistened again, and all was silent.  At length they suddenly heard a\\r\\ngreat noise of many steps in the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merciful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa, \"it must be your father and mother\\r\\ncome back.\"  Marianne ran to unlock the room door, and Mrs. Theresa\\r\\nfollowed her into the hall.  The hall was rather dark, but under the lamp\\r\\na crowd of people, all the servants in the house having gathered\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Theresa approached, the crowd opened in silence, and in the midst\\r\\nshe beheld Frederick, with blood streaming from his face.  His head was\\r\\nheld by Christopher; and the chimney-sweeper was holding a basin for him.\\r\\n\"Merciful! what will become of me?\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa.  \"Bleeding!\\r\\nhe\\'ll bleed to death!  Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood\\r\\nin a minute?  A key, a large key down his back--a key--has nobody a key?\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Montague will be here before he has done bleeding.  A key!\\r\\ncobwebs! a puff ball! for mercy\\'s sake! Can nobody think of anything that\\r\\nwill stop blood in a minute?  Gracious me! he\\'ll bleed to death, I\\r\\nbelieve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll bleed to death!  Oh, my brother!\" cried Marianne, catching hold of\\r\\nthe words; and terrified, she ran upstairs, crying, \"Sophy, oh, Sophy!\\r\\ncome down this minute, or he\\'ll be dead!  My brother\\'s bleeding to death!\\r\\nSophy! Sophy! come down, or he\\'ll be dead!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let go the basin, you,\" said Christopher, pulling the basin out of the\\r\\nchimney-sweeper\\'s hand, who had all this time stood in silence; \"you are\\r\\nnot fit to hold the basin for a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him hold it,\" said Frederick; \"he did not mean to hurt me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s more than he deserves.  I\\'m certain sure he might have known well\\r\\nenough it was Mr. Frederick all the time, and he\\'d no business to go to\\r\\nfight--such a one as he--with a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know he was a gentleman!\" said the chimney-sweeper, \"how could\\r\\nI?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could he, indeed!\" said Frederick; \"he shall hold the basin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracious me!  I\\'m glad to hear him speak like himself again, at\\r\\nanyrate,\" cried Mrs. Theresa.  \"And here comes Miss Sophy, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sophy!\" cried Frederick.  \"Oh, Sophy, don\\'t you come--don\\'t look at me;\\r\\nyou\\'ll despise me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother! where? where?\" said Sophy, looking, as she thought, at the\\r\\ntwo chimney-sweepers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s Frederick,\" said Marianne:  \"that\\'s my brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Sophy, don\\'t be alarmed,\" Mrs. Theresa began; \"but gracious\\r\\ngoodness!  I wish Miss Bertha--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs; she\\r\\npassed swiftly on, whilst everyone gave way before her.  \"Oh, Miss\\r\\nBertha!\" cried Mrs. Theresa, catching hold of her gown to stop her, as\\r\\nshe came near Frederick.  \"Oh, Miss Eden, your beautiful India muslin!\\r\\ntake care of the chimney sweeper, for heaven\\'s sake.\"  But she pressed\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s my brother, will he die?\" cried Marianne, throwing her arms round\\r\\nher, and looking up as if to a being of a superior order.  \"Will he bleed\\r\\nto death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my love!\" answered a sweet voice:  \"do not frighten thyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve done bleeding,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me, Miss Marianne, if you would not make such a rout,\" cried Mrs.\\r\\nTattle.  \"Miss Bertha, it\\'s nothing but a frolic.  You see Mr. Frederick\\r\\nMontague only in a masquerade dress.  Nothing in the world but a frolic,\\r\\nma\\'am.  You see he\\'s stopped bleeding.  I was frightened out of my wits\\r\\nat first.  I thought it was his eye, but I see it\\'s only his nose.  All\\'s\\r\\nwell that ends well.  Mr. Frederick, we\\'ll keep your counsel.  Pray,\\r\\nma\\'am, let us ask no questions; it\\'s only a boyish frolic.  Come, Mr.\\r\\nFrederick, this way, into my room, and I\\'ll give you a towel and some\\r\\nclean water, and you can get rid of this masquerade dress.  Make haste,\\r\\nfor fear your father and mother should drop in upon us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be afraid of thy father and mother.  They are surely thy best\\r\\nfriends,\" said a voice.  It was the voice of an elderly gentleman, who\\r\\nnow stood behind Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir, oh, Mr. Eden,\" said Frederick, turning to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t betray me! for goodness\\' sake!\" whispered Mrs. Tattle, \"say\\r\\nnothing about me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not thinking about you.  Let me speak,\" cried he, pushing away her\\r\\nhand, which stopped his mouth.  \"I shall say nothing about you, I promise\\r\\nyou,\" said Frederick, with a look of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but for your own sake, my dear sir, your papa and mamma.  Bless me!\\r\\nis not that Mrs. Montague\\'s carriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother, ma\\'am,\" said Sophy, \"is not afraid of my father and mother\\'s\\r\\ncoming back.  Let him speak; he was going to speak the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Miss Sophia, I wouldn\\'t hinder him from speaking the truth;\\r\\nbut it\\'s not proper, I presume, ma\\'am, to speak truth at all times, and\\r\\nin all places, and before everybody, servants and all.  I only wanted,\\r\\nma\\'am, to hinder your brother from exposing himself.  A hall, I\\r\\napprehend, is not a proper place for explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said Mr. Eden, opening the door of his room, which was on the\\r\\nopposite side of the hall to Mrs. Tattle\\'s.  \"Here is a place,\" said he\\r\\nto Frederick, \"where thou mayst speak the truth at all times, and before\\r\\neverybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, my room\\'s at Mr. Frederick Montague\\'s service, and my door\\'s open\\r\\ntoo.  This way, pray,\" said she, pulling his arm.  But Frederick broke\\r\\nfrom her, and followed Mr. Eden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir, will you forgive me?\" cried he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive thee!--and what have I to forgive!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive, brother, without asking what,\" said Bertha, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shall know all!\" cried Frederick; \"all that concerns myself, I mean.\\r\\nSir, I disguised myself in this dress; I came up to your room to-night on\\r\\npurpose to see you, without your knowing it, that I might mimic you.  The\\r\\nchimney-sweeper, where is he?\" said Frederick, looking round; and he ran\\r\\ninto the hall to see for him.  \"May he come in? he may--he is a brave, an\\r\\nhonest, good, grateful boy.  He never guessed who I was.  After we left\\r\\nyou we went down to the kitchen together, and there, fool as I was, for\\r\\nthe pleasure of making Mr. Christopher and the servants laugh, began to\\r\\nmimic you.  This boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at;\\r\\nthat you had saved his life; that I ought to be ashamed of myself; that\\r\\nyou had just given me half a crown; and so you had; but I went on, and\\r\\ntold him I\\'d knock him down if he said another word.  He did; I gave the\\r\\nfirst blow; we fought; I came to the ground; the servants pulled me up\\r\\nagain.  They found out, I don\\'t know how, that I was not a chimney-\\r\\nsweeper.  The rest you saw.  And now can you forgive me, sir?\" said\\r\\nFrederick to Mr. Eden, seizing hold of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other hand, friend,\" said the Quaker, gently withdrawing his right\\r\\nhand, which everybody now observed was much swelled, and putting it into\\r\\nhis bosom again.  \"This, and welcome,\" offering his other hand to\\r\\nFrederick, and shaking his with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that other hand!\" said Frederick, \"that was hurt, I remember.  How\\r\\nill I have behaved--extremely ill!  But this is a lesson that I shall\\r\\nnever forget as long as I live.  I hope for the future I shall behave\\r\\nlike a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And like a man--and like a good man, I am sure thou wilt,\" said the good\\r\\nQuaker, shaking Frederick\\'s hand affectionately; \"or I am much mistaken,\\r\\nfriend, in that black countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not mistaken,\" cried Marianne.  \"Frederick will never be\\r\\npersuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right:  and now,\\r\\nbrother, you may wash your black countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance, a double\\r\\nknock was heard at the door.  It was Mr. and Mrs. Montague.  \"What will\\r\\nyou do now?\" whispered Mrs. Theresa to Frederick, as his father and\\r\\nmother came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A chimney-sweeper covered with blood!\" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Montague.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Father, I am Frederick,\" said he, stepping forward towards them, as they\\r\\nstood in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Frederick! my son!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, mother, I\\'m not hurt half so much as I deserve; I\\'ll tell you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" interrupted Bertha, \"let my brother tell the story this time.\\r\\nThou hast told it once, and told it well; no one but my brother could\\r\\ntell it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A story never tells so well the second time, to be sure,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa; \"but Mr. Eden will certainly make the best of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout taking any notice of Mrs. Tattle, or her apprehensive looks, Mr.\\r\\nEden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words.  \"Your son,\"\\r\\nconcluded he, \"will quickly put off his dirty dress.  The dress hath not\\r\\nstained the mind; that is fair and honourable.  When he found himself in\\r\\nthe wrong, he said so; nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from\\r\\nhis father; this made me think well of both father and son.  I speak\\r\\nplainly, friend, for that is best.  But what is become of the other\\r\\nchimney-sweeper?  He will want to go home,\" said Mr. Eden, turning to\\r\\nMrs. Theresa.  Without making any reply, she hurried out of the room as\\r\\nfast as possible, and returned in a few moments, with a look of extreme\\r\\nconsternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a catastrophe indeed!  Now, indeed, Mr. Frederick, your papa and\\r\\nmamma have reason to be angry.  A new suit of clothes!--the bare faced\\r\\nvillain! gone! no sign of them in my closet, or anywhere.  The door was\\r\\nlocked; he must have gone up the chimney, out upon the leads, and so\\r\\nescaped; but Christopher is after him.  I protest, Mrs. Montague, you\\r\\ntake it too quietly.  The wretch!--a new suit of clothes, blue coat and\\r\\nbuff waistcoat.  I never heard of such a thing!  I declare, Mr. Montague,\\r\\nyou are vastly good, not to be in a passion,\" added Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madam,\" replied Mr. Montague, with a look of much civil contempt, \"I\\r\\nthink the loss of a suit of clothes, and even the disgrace that my son\\r\\nhas been brought to this evening, fortunate circumstances in his\\r\\neducation.  He will, I am persuaded, judge and act for himself more\\r\\nwisely in future.  Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity, for\\r\\nthe sake of being called \\'The best mimic in the world.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BARRING OUT; OR, PARTY SPIRIT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The mother of mischief,\" says an old proverb, \"is no bigger than a\\r\\nmidge\\'s wing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Doctor Middleton\\'s school, there was a great tall dunce of the name of\\r\\nFisher, who never could be taught how to look out a word in the\\r\\ndictionary.  He used to torment everybody with--\"Do pray help me!  I\\r\\ncan\\'t make out this one word.\"  The person who usually helped him in his\\r\\ndistress was a very clever, good natured boy, of the name of De Grey, who\\r\\nhad been many years under Dr. Middleton\\'s care, and who, by his abilities\\r\\nand good conduct, did him great credit.  The doctor certainly was both\\r\\nproud and fond of him; but he was so well beloved, or so much esteemed by\\r\\nhis companions, that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of\\r\\nfavourite, until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Archer came, the ideas of FAVOURITES and PARTIES were almost unknown\\r\\nat Dr. Middleton\\'s; but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great\\r\\npublic school, at which he had been educated--at which he had acquired a\\r\\nsufficient quantity of Greek and Latin, and a superabundant quantity of\\r\\nparty spirit.  His aim, the moment he came to a new school, was to get to\\r\\nthe head of it, or at least to form the strongest party.  His influence,\\r\\nfor he was a boy of considerable abilities, was quickly felt, though he\\r\\nhad a powerful rival, as he thought proper to call him, in De Grey; and,\\r\\nwith HIM, a rival was always an enemy.  De Grey, so far from giving him\\r\\nany cause of hatred, treated him with a degree of cordiality, which would\\r\\nprobably have had an effect upon Archer\\'s mind, if it had not been for\\r\\nthe artifices of Fisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem surprising, that a GREAT DUNCE should be able to work upon a\\r\\nboy like an Archer, who was called a great genius; but when genius is\\r\\njoined to a violent temper, instead of being united to good sense, it is\\r\\nat the mercy even of dunces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey\\'s refusing to\\r\\ntranslate his whole lesson for him.  He went over to Archer, who,\\r\\nconsidering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy, received him with\\r\\nopen arms, and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH\\r\\ncontempt for his stupidity.  From this moment Fisher forgot all De Grey\\'s\\r\\nformer kindness, and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the\\r\\nperson whom he felt to be so much his superior.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium, which was to be given\\r\\nin their class.  Fisher betted on Archer\\'s head, who had not sense enough\\r\\nto despise the bet of a blockhead.  On the contrary he suffered him to\\r\\nexcite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets\\r\\nof all the school.  So that this premium now became a matter of the\\r\\ngreatest consequence, and Archer, instead of taking the means to secure a\\r\\njudgment in his favour, was listening to the opinions of all his\\r\\ncompanions.  It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions; but\\r\\nhe suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance.  The\\r\\nconsequence was, that he trusted to chance--his partisans lost their\\r\\nwagers, and he the premium--and his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Archer,\" said Dr. Middleton, after the grand affair was decided,\\r\\n\"you have done all that genius alone could do; but you, De Grey, have\\r\\ndone all that genius and industry united could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" cried Archer, with affected gaiety, as soon as the doctor had\\r\\nleft the room--\"Well, I\\'m content with MY sentence.  Genius alone! for\\r\\nme--industry for those who WANT it,\" added he, with a significant look at\\r\\nDe Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher applauded this as a very spirited speech; and, by insinuations\\r\\nthat Dr. Middleton \"always gave the premium to De Grey,\" and that \"those\\r\\nwho had lost their bets might thank themselves for it, for being such\\r\\nsimpletons as to bet against the favourite,\" he raised a murmur highly\\r\\nflattering to Archer, amongst some of the most credulous boys; whilst\\r\\nothers loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr. Middleton\\'s impartiality.\\r\\nThese warmly congratulated De Grey.  At this Archer grew more and more\\r\\nangry, and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him, pushed\\r\\nforward into the circle to De Grey, crying, \"I wish, Mr. Fisher, you\\r\\nwould let me fight my own battles!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And _I_ wish,\" said young Townsend, who was fonder of diversions than of\\r\\npremiums, or battles, or of anything else--\"_I_ wish, that we were not to\\r\\nhave any battles; after having worked like horses, don\\'t set about to\\r\\nfight like dogs.  Come,\" said he, tapping De Grey\\'s shoulder, \"let us see\\r\\nyour new playhouse, do--it\\'s a holiday, and let us make the most of it.\\r\\nLet us have the \\'School for Scandal,\\' do; and I\\'ll play Charles for you,\\r\\nand you, De Grey, shall be MY LITTLE PREMIUM.  Come, do open this new\\r\\nplayhouse of yours to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come then!\" said De Grey, and he ran across the playground to a waste\\r\\nbuilding at the farthest end of it, in which, at the earnest request of\\r\\nthe whole community, and with the permission of Dr. Middleton, he had\\r\\nwith much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new theatre is going to be opened!  Follow the manager!  Follow the\\r\\nmanager!\" echoed a multitude of voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"FOLLOW THE MANAGER!\" echoed very disagreeably in Archer\\'s ear; but as he\\r\\ncould not be LEFT ALONE, he was also obliged to follow the manager.  The\\r\\nmoment that the door was unlocked, the crowd rushed in:  the delight and\\r\\nwonder expressed at the sight was great, and the applause and thanks\\r\\nwhich were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher at least thought them long, for he was impatient till his voice\\r\\ncould be heard.  When at length the acclamations had spent themselves, he\\r\\nwalked across the stage with a knowing air, and looking round\\r\\ncontemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is THIS your famous playhouse?\" cried he.  \"I wish you had, any of\\r\\nyou, seen the playhouse _I_ have been used to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions\\r\\nof the public.  \"Who would be a servant of the public? or who would toil\\r\\nfor popular applause?\"  A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new\\r\\nvoice operated as a charm, and the playhouse was in an instant\\r\\nmetamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators.  All gratitude for the past\\r\\nwas forgotten, and the expectation of something better justified to the\\r\\ncapricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced\\r\\nto be excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone now began to criticise.  One observed, \"that the green curtain\\r\\nwas full of holes, and would not draw up.\"  Another attacked the scenes;\\r\\n\"Scenes! they were not like real scenes--Archer must know best, because\\r\\nhe was used to these things.\"  So everybody crowded to hear something of\\r\\nthe OTHER playhouse.  They gathered round Archer to hear the description\\r\\nof his playhouse, and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made.\\r\\nWhen he had done, his auditors looked round, sighed and wished that\\r\\nArcher had been their manager.  They turned from De Grey as from a person\\r\\nwho had done them an injury.  Some of his friends--for he had friends who\\r\\nwere not swayed by the popular opinion--felt indignation at this\\r\\ningratitude, and were going to express their feelings; but De Grey\\r\\nstopped them, and begged that he might speak for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, coming forward, as soon as he felt that he had\\r\\nsufficient command of himself.  \"My friends, I see you are discontented\\r\\nwith me and my playhouse.  I have done my best to please you; but if\\r\\nanybody else can please you better, I shall be glad of it.  I did not\\r\\nwork so hard for the glory of being your manager.  You have my free leave\\r\\nto tear down--\"  Here his voice faltered, but he hurried on--\"You have my\\r\\nfree leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please.  Archer, shake\\r\\nhands first, however, to show that there\\'s no malice in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who was touched by what his rival said, and, stopping the hand of\\r\\nhis new partisan, Fisher, cried, \"No, Fisher! no!--no pulling down.  We\\r\\ncan alter it.  There is a great deal of ingenuity in it, considering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain Archer would now have recalled the public to reason,--the time\\r\\nfor reason was passed:  enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds.  \"Down\\r\\nwith it!  Down with it!  Archer for ever!\" cried Fisher, and tore down\\r\\nthe curtain.  The riot once begun, nothing could stop the little mob,\\r\\ntill the whole theatre was demolished.  The love of power prevailed in\\r\\nthe mind of Archer; he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his PARTY,\\r\\nand he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself.  De Grey\\r\\nlooked on superior.  \"I said I could bear to see all this, and I can,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"now it is all over.\"  And now it was all over, there was\\r\\nsilence.  The rioters stood still to take breath, and to look at what\\r\\nthey had done.  There was a blank space before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice.  \"Hush!\\r\\nWhat strange voice is that?\" said Archer.  Fisher caught fast hold of his\\r\\narm.  Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from.  It was\\r\\ndusk.  Two window-shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen\\r\\nto move slowly inwards.  De Grey, and in the same instant Archer, went\\r\\nforward; and, as the shutters opened, there appeared through the hole the\\r\\ndark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy.  She did not speak;\\r\\nbut she looked first at one and then at another.  At length she fixed her\\r\\neyes on De Grey.  \"Well, woman,\" said he, \"what do you want with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Want!--nothing--with YOU,\" said the old woman; \"do you want nothing with\\r\\nME?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said De Grey.  Her eye immediately turned upon Archer,--\"YOU\\r\\nwant something with me,\" said she, with emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--what do I want?\" replied Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said she, changing her tone, \"you want nothing--nothing will you\\r\\never want, or I am much mistaken in that FACE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that WATCH-CHAIN, she should have said, for her quick eye had espied\\r\\nArcher\\'s watch-chain.  He was the only person in the company who had a\\r\\nwatch, and she therefore judged him to be the richest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you ever your fortune told, sir, in your life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I!\" said he, looking at De Grey, as if he was afraid of his\\r\\nridicule, if he listened to the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not you!  No! for you will make your own fortune, and the fortune of all\\r\\nthat belong to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s good news for my friends!\" cried Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'m one of them, remember that,\" cried Fisher.  \"And I,\" \"And I,\"\\r\\njoined a number of voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good luck to them!\" cried the gipsy, \"good luck to them all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good\\r\\nwill, they pressed up to the window.  \"There,\" cried Townsend, as he\\r\\nchanced to stumble over the carpenter\\'s mitre box, which stood in the\\r\\nway, \"there\\'s a good omen for me.  I\\'ve stumbled on the mitre box; I\\r\\nshall certainly be a bishop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy he who had sixpence, for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench.\\r\\nAnd happier he who had a shilling, for he was in the high road to be one\\r\\nday upon the woolsack, Lord High Chancellor of England.  No one had half\\r\\na crown, or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an\\r\\noccasion, for he might have been an archbishop, a king, or what he\\r\\npleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher, who like all weak people was extremely credulous, kept his post\\r\\nimmovable in the front row all the time, his mouth open, and his stupid\\r\\neyes fixed upon the gipsy, in whom he felt implicit faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have least confidence in their own powers, and who have least\\r\\nexpectation from the success of their own exertions, are always most\\r\\ndisposed to trust in fortune-tellers and fortune.  They hope to WIN, when\\r\\nthey cannot EARN; and as they can never be convinced by those who speak\\r\\nsense, it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk\\r\\nnonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a question to put,\" said Fisher, in a solemn tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put it, then,\" said Archer, \"what hinders you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they will hear me,\" said he, looking suspiciously at De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_ shall not hear you,\" said De Grey, \"I am going.\"  Everybody else\\r\\ndrew back, and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy\\'s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is become of my Livy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your SISTER Livy, do you mean?\" said the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my LATIN Livy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gipsy paused for information.  \"It had a leaf torn out in the\\r\\nbeginning, and I HATE DR. MIDDLETON--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Written in it,\" interrupted the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right--the very book!\" cried Fisher with joy.  \"But how COULD you know\\r\\nit was Dr. Middleton\\'s name?  I thought I had scratched it, so that\\r\\nnobody could make it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody COULD make it out but ME,\" replied the gipsy.  \"But never think\\r\\nto deceive me,\" said she, shaking her head at him in a manner that made\\r\\nhim tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t deceive you indeed, I tell you the whole truth.  I lost it a\\r\\nweek ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when shall I find it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Meet me here at this hour to-morrow evening, and I will answer you.  No\\r\\nmore!  I must be gone.  Not a word more to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pulled the shutters towards her, and left the youth in darkness.  All\\r\\nhis companions were gone.  He had been so deeply engaged in this\\r\\nconference, that he had not perceived their departure.  He found all the\\r\\nworld at supper, but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his\\r\\nsecret.  Townsend rallied in vain.  As for Archer, he was not disposed to\\r\\ndestroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old woman\\'s\\r\\npredictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his\\r\\nlittle partisans.  He had privately slipped two good shillings into the\\r\\ngipsy\\'s hand to secure her; for he was willing to pay any price for ANY\\r\\nmeans of acquiring power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watch-chain had not deceived the gipsy, for Archer was the richest\\r\\nperson in the community.  His friends had imprudently supplied him with\\r\\nmore money than is usually trusted to boys of his age.  Dr. Middleton had\\r\\nrefused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his\\r\\ncompanions; but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five\\r\\nguineas.  This appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible\\r\\ntreasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiches and talents would, he flattered himself, secure to him that\\r\\nascendancy of which he was so ambitious.  \"Am I your manager, or not?\"\\r\\nwas now his question.  \"I scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment; but\\r\\nsince last night you have had time to consider.  If you desire me to be\\r\\nyour manager, you shall see what a theatre I will make for you.  In this\\r\\npurse,\" said he, showing through the network a glimpse of the shining\\r\\ntreasure--\"in this purse is Aladdin\\'s wonderful lamp.  Am I your manager?\\r\\nPut it to the vote.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was put to the vote.  About ten of the most reasonable of the assembly\\r\\ndeclared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend, De\\r\\nGrey; but the numbers were in favour of the new friend.  And as no\\r\\nmetaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever\\r\\nentered their thoughts, the most numerous party considered themselves as\\r\\nnow beyond dispute in the right.  They drew off on one side in triumph,\\r\\nand their leader, who knew the consequence of a name in party matters,\\r\\nimmediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of ARCHERS,\\r\\nstigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental\\r\\nqualifications; but who, by their bodily activity, and by the peculiar\\r\\nadvantages annexed to their way of life, rendered themselves of the\\r\\nhighest consequence, especially to the rich and enterprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called\\r\\nday scholars.  Amongst these, Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge\\r\\nof all the streets and shops in the adjacent town; and, though a dull\\r\\nscholar, he had such reputation as a man of business, that whoever had\\r\\ncommissions to execute at the confectioner\\'s, was sure to apply to him.\\r\\nSome of the youngest of his employers had, it is true, at times\\r\\ncomplained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their\\r\\naccounts; but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial,\\r\\nFisher\\'s character and consequence were undiminished, till the fatal day\\r\\nwhen his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner\\'s; or,\\r\\nrather, till she requested the confectioner, who had his private reasons\\r\\nfor obeying her, not TO RECEIVE her nephew\\'s visits, as he had made\\r\\nhimself sick at his house, and Mrs. Barbara\\'s fears for his health were\\r\\nincessant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough his visits to the confectioner\\'s were thus at an end, there were\\r\\nmany other shops open to him; and with officious zeal he offered his\\r\\nservices to the new manager, to purchase whatever might be wanting for\\r\\nthe theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his father\\'s death Fisher had become a boarder at Dr. Middleton\\'s,\\r\\nbut his frequent visits to his Aunt Barbara afforded him opportunities of\\r\\ngoing into the town.  The carpenter, De Grey\\'s friend, was discarded by\\r\\nArcher, for having said \"LACK-A-DAISY!\" when he saw that the old theatre\\r\\nwas pulled down.  A new carpenter and paper hanger, recommended by\\r\\nFisher, were appointed to attend, with their tools, for orders, at two\\r\\no\\'clock.  Archer, impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity,\\r\\ngave his plan and his orders in a few minutes, in a most decided manner;\\r\\n\"These things,\" he observed, \"should be done with some spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which the carpenter readily assented, and added, that \"gentlemen of\\r\\nspirit never looked to the EXPENSE, but always to the EFFECT.\"  Upon this\\r\\nprinciple Mr. Chip set to work with all possible alacrity.  In a few\\r\\nhours\\' time he promised to produce a grand effect.  High expectations\\r\\nwere formed.  Nothing was talked of but the new playhouse; and so intent\\r\\nupon it was every head, that no lessons could be got.  Archer was\\r\\nobliged, in the midst of his various occupations, to perform the part of\\r\\ngrammar and dictionary for twenty different people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O ye Athenians!\" he exclaimed, \"how hard do I work to obtain your\\r\\npraise!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImpatient to return to the theatre, the moment the hours destined for\\r\\ninstruction, or, as they are termed by schoolboys, school-hours, were\\r\\nover, each prisoner started up with a shout of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop one moment, gentlemen, if you please,\" said Dr. Middleton, in an\\r\\nawful voice.  \"Mr. Archer, return to your place.  Are you all here?\"  The\\r\\nnames of all the boys were called over, and when each had answered to his\\r\\nname, Dr. Middleton said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen, I am sorry to interrupt your amusements; but, till you have\\r\\ncontrary orders from me, no one, on pain of my serious displeasure, must\\r\\ngo into THAT building\" (pointing to the place where the theatre was\\r\\nerecting).  \"Mr. Archer, your carpenter is at the door.  You will be so\\r\\ngood as to dismiss him.  I do not think proper to give my reasons for\\r\\nthese orders; but you who KNOW me,\" said the doctor, and his eye turned\\r\\ntowards De Grey, \"will not suspect me of caprice.  I depend, gentlemen,\\r\\nupon your obedience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the dead silence with which these orders were received, succeeded in a\\r\\nfew minutes a universal groan.  \"So!\" said Townsend, \"all our diversion\\r\\nis over.\"  \"So,\" whispered Fisher in the manager\\'s ear, \"this is some\\r\\ntrick of the Greybeard\\'s.  Did you not observe how he looked at De Grey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFired by this thought, which had never entered his mind before, Archer\\r\\nstarted from his reverie, and striking his hand upon the table, swore\\r\\nthat he \"would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe--no, nor by\\r\\nall of them put together.  The Archers were surely a match for them.  He\\r\\nwould stand by them, if they would stand by him,\" he declared, with a\\r\\nloud voice, \"against the whole world, and Dr. Middleton himself, with\\r\\n\\'LITTLE PREMIUMS\\' at his right hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody admired Archer\\'s spirit, but were a little appalled at the\\r\\nsound of standing against Dr. Middleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\" resumed the indignant manager.  \"Neither Dr. Middleton nor any\\r\\ndoctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice.  This, you see, is a\\r\\nstroke at me and my party, and I won\\'t bear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you are mistaken!\" said De Grey, who was the only one who dared to\\r\\noppose reason to the angry orator.  \"It cannot be a stroke aimed at \\'you\\r\\nand your party,\\' for he does not know that you HAVE a party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll make him know it, and I\\'ll make YOU know it, too,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\"Before I came here you reigned alone, now your reign is over, Mr. De\\r\\nGrey.  Remember my majority this morning, and your theatre last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has remembered it,\" said Fisher.  \"You see, the moment he was not to\\r\\nbe our manager, we were to have no theatre, no playhouse, no plays.  We\\r\\nmust all sit down with our hands before us--all for \\'GOOD REASONS\\' of Dr.\\r\\nMiddleton\\'s, which he does not vouchsafe to tell us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t be governed by any man\\'s reasons that he won\\'t tell me,\" cried\\r\\nArcher.  \"He cannot have good reasons, or why not tell them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" said De Grey.  \"WE SHALL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF CAPRICE!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because we who know him, have never known him capricious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not.  _I_ know nothing about him,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said De Grey; \"for that very reason _I_ speak who do know him.\\r\\nDon\\'t be in a passion, Archer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will be in a passion.  I won\\'t submit to tyranny.  I won\\'t be made a\\r\\nfool of by a few soft words.  You don\\'t know me, De Grey.  I\\'ll go\\r\\nthrough with what I\\'ve begun.  I am manager, and I will be manager; and\\r\\nyou shall see my theatre finished in spite of you, and MY party\\r\\ntriumphant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Party,\" repeated De Grey.  \"I cannot imagine what is in the word \\'party\\'\\r\\nthat seems to drive you mad.  We never heard of parties till you came\\r\\namongst us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; before I came, I say, nobody dared oppose you; but I dare; and I\\r\\ntell you to your face, take care of me--a warm friend and a bitter enemy\\r\\nis my motto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not your enemy!  I believe you are out of your senses, Archer!\"\\r\\nsaid he, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of my senses!  No; you are my enemy!  Are you not my rival?  Did not\\r\\nyou win the premium?  Did not you want to be manager?  Answer me, are not\\r\\nyou, in one word, a Greybeard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You called me a Greybeard, but my name is De Grey,\" said he, still\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh on!\" cried the other, furiously.  \"Come, ARCHERS, follow me.  WE\\r\\nshall laugh by-and-by, I promise you.\"  At the door Archer was stopped by\\r\\nMr. Chip.  \"Oh, Mr. Chip, I am ordered to discharge you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; and here\\'s a little bill--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bill, Mr. Chip! why, you have not been at work for two hours!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much over, sir; but if you\\'ll please to look into it, you\\'ll see\\r\\n\\'tis for a few things you ordered.  The stuff is all laid out and\\r\\ndelivered.  The paper and the festoon-bordering for the drawing room\\r\\nscene is cut out, and left yAnder within.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YAnder, within!  I wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry--\\r\\nsix-and-twenty shillings!\" cried he; \"but I can\\'t stay to talk about it\\r\\nnow.  I\\'ll tell you, Mr. Chip,\" said Archer, lowering his voice, \"what\\r\\nyou must do for me, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, drawing Mr. Chip aside, he begged him to pull down some of the wood\\r\\nwork which had been put up, and to cut it into a certain number of wooden\\r\\nbars, of which he gave him the dimensions, with orders to place them all,\\r\\nwhen ready, under a haystack, which he pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chip scrupled and hesitated, and began to talk of \"THE DOCTOR.\"\\r\\nArcher immediately began to talk of the bill, and throwing down a guinea\\r\\nand a half, the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly, and\\r\\nmade his bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Master Archer,\" said he, \"there\\'s no refusing you nothing.  You\\r\\nhave such a way of talking one out of it.  You manage me just like a\\r\\nchild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Archer, knowing that he had been cheated, and yet proud of\\r\\nmanaging a carpenter, \"ay, ay!  I know the way to manage everybody.  Let\\r\\nthe things be ready in an hour\\'s time, and hark\\'e! leave your tools by\\r\\nmistake behind you, and a thousand of twenty-penny nails.  Ask no\\r\\nquestions, and keep your own counsel like a wise man.  Off with you, and\\r\\ntake care of \\'THE DOCTOR.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Archers, Archers, to the Archers\\' tree!  Follow your leader,\" cried he,\\r\\nsounding his well known whistle as a signal.  His followers gathered\\r\\nround him, and he, raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the\\r\\ntree, counted his numbers, and then, in a voice lower than usual,\\r\\naddressed them thus:--\"My friends, is there a Greybeard amongst us?  If\\r\\nthere is, let him walk off at once, he has my free leave.\"  No one\\r\\nstirred.  \"Then we are all Archers, and we will stand by one another.\\r\\nJoin hands, my friends.\"  They all joined hands.  \"Promise me not to\\r\\nbetray me, and I will go on.  I ask no security but your honour.\"  They\\r\\nall gave their honour to be secret and FAITHFUL, as he called it, and he\\r\\nwent on.  \"Did you ever hear of such a thing as a \\'BARRING OUT,\\' my\\r\\nfriends?\"  They had heard of such a thing, but they had only heard of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher gave the history of a \"Barring Out,\" in which he had been\\r\\nconcerned at his school, in which the boys stood out against the master,\\r\\nand gained their point at last, which was a week\\'s more holidays at\\r\\nEaster.*  \"But if WE should not succeed,\" said they, \"Dr.  Middleton is\\r\\nso steady; he never goes back from what he has said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever try to push him back?  Let us be steady and he\\'ll tremble.\\r\\nTyrants always tremble when--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted a number of voices; \"but he is not a tyrant--is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All schoolmasters are tyrants--are not they?\" replied Archer; \"and is\\r\\nnot he a schoolmaster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this logic there was no answer; but, still reluctant, they asked,\\r\\n\"What they should GET by a Barring Out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get!--everything!--what we want!--which is everything to lads of spirit-\\r\\n-victory and liberty!  Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law;\\r\\ntill he lets us into our own theatre again, or till he tells us his \\'GOOD\\r\\nREASONS\\' against it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he has reasons for not telling us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" cried Archer, \"that\\'s the way we are always to be governed\\r\\nby a man in a wig, who says he has good reasons, and can\\'t tell them.\\r\\nAre you fools?  Go! go back to De Grey!  I see you are all Greybeards.\\r\\nGo!  Who goes first?\"  Nobody would go FIRST.  \"I will have nothing to do\\r\\nwith ye, if ye are resolved to be slaves!\"  \"We won\\'t be slaves!\" they\\r\\nall exclaimed at once.  \"Then,\" said Archer, \"stand out in the right and\\r\\nbe free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*[This custom of \"BARRING OUT\" was very general (especially in the\\r\\nnorthern parts of England) during the 17th and 18th centuries, and it has\\r\\nbeen fully described by Brand and other antiquarian writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Johnson mentions that Addison, while under the tuition of Mr. Shaw,\\r\\nmaster of the Lichfield Grammar School, led, and successfully conducted,\\r\\n\"a plan for BARRING OUT his master.  A disorderly privilege,\" says the\\r\\ndoctor, \"which, in his time, prevailed in the principal seminaries of\\r\\neducation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Gentleman\\'s Magazine of 1828, Dr. P. A. Nuttall, under the\\r\\nsignature of II. A. N., has given a spirited sketch of a \"BARRING OUT\" at\\r\\nthe Ormskirk Grammar School, which has since been republished at length\\r\\n(though without acknowledgment), by Sir Henry Ellis, in Bohn\\'s recent\\r\\nedition of Brand\\'s \"Popular Antiquities.\"  This operation took place\\r\\nearly in the present century, and is interesting from its being, perhaps,\\r\\nthe last attempt on record, and also from the circumstance of the writer\\r\\nhimself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the daring adventure,\\r\\n\"quo rum pars magna fuit,\"--Ed.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE RIGHT.\"  It would have taken up too much time to examine what \"THE\\r\\nRIGHT\" was.  Archer was always sure that \"THE RIGHT\" was what his party\\r\\nchose to do; that is, what he chose to do himself; and such is the\\r\\ninfluence of numbers upon each other, in conquering the feelings of shame\\r\\nand in confusing the powers of reasoning, that in a few minutes \"the\\r\\nright\" was forgotten, and each said to himself, \"To be sure, Archer is a\\r\\nvery clever boy, and he can\\'t be mistaken\"; or, \"to be sure, Townsend\\r\\nthinks so, and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape\"; or, \"to\\r\\nbe sure, everybody will agree to this but myself, and I can\\'t stand out\\r\\nalone, to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave.  Everybody thinks it\\r\\nis right, and everybody can\\'t be wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some of these arguments, which passed rapidly through the mind without\\r\\nhis being conscious of them, each boy decided, and deceived himself--what\\r\\nnone would have done alone, none scrupled to do as a party.  It was\\r\\ndetermined, then, that there should be a Barring Out.  The arrangement of\\r\\nthe affair was left to their new manager, to whom they all pledged\\r\\nimplicit obedience.  Obedience, it seems, is necessary, even from rebels\\r\\nto their ringleaders; not reasonable, but implicit obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball-alley, when Fisher, with\\r\\nan important length of face, came up to the manager, and desired to speak\\r\\none word to him.  \"My advice to you, Archer, is, to do nothing in this\\r\\ntill we have consulted, YOU KNOW WHO, about whether it\\'s right or wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'YOU KNOW WHO!\\'  Whom do you mean?  Make haste, and don\\'t make so many\\r\\nfaces, for I\\'m in a hurry.  Who is \\'YOU KNOW WHO?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old woman,\" said Fisher, gravely; \"the gipsy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may consult the old woman,\" said Archer, bursting out a-laughing,\\r\\n\"about what\\'s right and wrong, if you please; but no old woman shall\\r\\ndecide for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but you don\\'t TAKE me,\" said Fisher; \"you don\\'t TAKE me.  By right\\r\\nand wrong, I mean lucky and unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever _I_ do will be lucky,\" replied Archer.  \"My gipsy told you that\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, I know,\" said Fisher, \"and what she said about your friends\\r\\nbeing lucky--that went a great way with many,\" added he, with a sagacious\\r\\nnod of his head; \"I can tell you THAT--more than you think.  Do you\\r\\nknow,\" said he, laying hold of Archer\\'s button, \"I\\'m in the secret.\\r\\nThere are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it, not to stir\\r\\na step till we get her advice; and she has appointed me to meet her about\\r\\nparticular business of my own at eight.  So I\\'m to consult her and to\\r\\nbring her answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher knew too well how to govern fools, to attempt to reason with them;\\r\\nand, instead of laughing any longer at Fisher\\'s ridiculous superstition,\\r\\nhe was determined to take advantage of it.  He affected to be persuaded\\r\\nof the wisdom of the measure; looked at his watch; urged him to be exact\\r\\nto a moment; conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle;\\r\\nand, above all things, to demand the lucky hour and minute when the\\r\\nBarring Out should begin.  With these instructions Archer put his watch\\r\\ninto the solemn dupe\\'s hand, and left him to count the seconds, till the\\r\\nmoment of his appointment, whilst he ran off himself to prepare the\\r\\noracle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a little gate which looked into a lane, through which he guessed that\\r\\nthe gipsy must pass, he stationed himself, saw her, gave her half a crown\\r\\nand her instructions, made his escape, and got back unsuspected to\\r\\nFisher, whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him, watching\\r\\nthe motion of the minute hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nProud of his secret commission, Fisher slouched his hat, he knew not why,\\r\\nover his face, and proceeded towards the appointed spot.  To keep, as he\\r\\nhad been charged by Archer, within the letter of the law, he stood BEHIND\\r\\nthe forbidden building, and waited some minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance,\\r\\nmuffled up, and looking cautiously about her.  \"There\\'s nobody near us!\"\\r\\nsaid Fisher, and he began to be a little afraid.  \"What answer,\" said he,\\r\\nrecollecting himself, \"about my Livy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lost! lost! lost!\" said the gipsy, lifting up her hands; \"never, never,\\r\\nnever to be found!  But no matter for that now; that is not your errand\\r\\nto-night; no tricks with me; speak to me of what is next your heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher, astonished, put his hand upon his heart, told her all that she\\r\\nknew before, and received the answers that Archer had dictated:  \"That\\r\\nthe Archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager, and\\r\\nto one another; that the Barring Out should end in woe, if not begun\\r\\nprecisely as the clock should strike nine on Wednesday night; but if\\r\\nbegun in that LUCKY moment, and all obedient to their LUCKY leader, all\\r\\nshould end well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA thought, a provident thought, now struck Fisher; for even he had some\\r\\nforesight where his favourite passion was concerned.  \"Pray, in our\\r\\nBarring Out shall we be starved?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the gipsy, \"not if you trust to me for food, and if you give\\r\\nme money enough.  Silver won\\'t do for so many; gold is what must cross my\\r\\nhand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no gold,\" said Fisher, \"and I don\\'t know what you mean by \\'so\\r\\nmany.\\'  I\\'m only talking of number one, you know.  I must take care of\\r\\nthat first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer, clever as he was,\\r\\nmight be disappointed in his supplies, he determined to take secret\\r\\nmeasures for himself.  His Aunt Barbara\\'s interdiction had shut him out\\r\\nof the confectioner\\'s shop; but he flattered himself that he could outwit\\r\\nhis aunt; he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by\\r\\nThursday morning, and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the\\r\\nschoolroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal, it was at\\r\\nfirst absolutely rejected; but a bribe at length conquered his\\r\\ndifficulties; and the bribe which Fisher found himself obliged to give--\\r\\nfor he had no pocket money left of his own, he being as much RESTRICTED\\r\\nin that article as Archer was INDULGED--the bribe that he found himself\\r\\nobliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown, which Archer had\\r\\nintrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre.  \"Oh,\" thought he to\\r\\nhimself; \"Archer\\'s so careless about money, he will never think of asking\\r\\nme for the half-crown again; and now he\\'ll want no candles for the\\r\\nTHEATRE; or, at anyrate, it will be some time first; and maybe, Aunt\\r\\nBarbara may be got to give me that much at Christmas; then, if the worst\\r\\ncomes to the worst, one can pay Archer.  My mouth waters for the buns,\\r\\nand have \\'em I must now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, for the hope of twelve buns, he sacrificed the money which had been\\r\\nintrusted to him.  Thus the meanest motives, in mean minds often prompt\\r\\nto the commission of those great faults, to which one should think\\r\\nnothing but some violent passion could have tempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambassador having thus, in his opinion, concluded his own and the\\r\\npublic business, returned well satisfied with the result, after receiving\\r\\nthe gipsy\\'s reiterated promise to tap THREE TIMES at the window on\\r\\nThursday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day appointed for the Barring Out at length arrived; and Archer,\\r\\nassembling the confederates, informed them, that all was prepared for\\r\\ncarrying their design into execution; that he now depended for success\\r\\nupon their punctuality and courage.  He had, within the last two hours,\\r\\ngot all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the\\r\\nschoolroom; he had, with the assistance of two of the day scholars who\\r\\nwere of the party, sent into the town for provisions, at his own expense,\\r\\nwhich would make a handsome supper for that night; he had also negotiated\\r\\nwith some cousins of his, who lived in the town, for a constant supply in\\r\\nfuture.  \"Bless me,\" exclaimed Archer, suddenly stopping in this\\r\\nnarration of his services, \"there\\'s one thing, after all, I\\'ve forgot, we\\r\\nshall be undone without it.  Fisher, pray did you ever buy the candles\\r\\nfor the playhouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure,\" replied Fisher, extremely frightened; \"you know you\\r\\ndon\\'t want candles for the playhouse now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for the playhouse, but for the Barring Out.  We shall be in the\\r\\ndark, man.  You must run this minute, run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For candles?\" said Fisher, confused; \"how many?--what sort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stupidity!\" exclaimed Archer, \"you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift!\\r\\nLend me a pencil and a bit of paper, do; I\\'ll write down what I want\\r\\nmyself!  Well, what are you fumbling for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For money!\" said Fisher, colouring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money, man!  Didn\\'t I give you half a crown the other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Fisher, stammering; \"but I wasn\\'t sure that that might be\\r\\nenough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough! yes, to be sure it will.  I don\\'t know what you are AT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Fisher, \"here, write upon this, then,\" said\\r\\nFisher, putting a piece of paper into Archer\\'s hand, upon which Archer\\r\\nwrote his orders.  \"Away, away!\" cried he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway went Fisher.  He returned; but not until a considerable time\\r\\nafterwards.  They were at supper when he returned.  \"Fisher always comes\\r\\nin at supper-time,\" observed one of the Greybeards, carelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and would you have him come in AFTER supper-time?\" said Townsend,\\r\\nwho always supplied his party with ready wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got the candles,\" whispered Fisher as he passed by Archer to his\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the tinder-box?\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I got back from my Aunt Barbara under pretence that I must study\\r\\nfor repetition day an hour later to-night.  So I got leave.  Was not that\\r\\nclever?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by SOBER LIES.  How Mr.\\r\\nFisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money, and without\\r\\ncredit, we shall discover further on.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom;\\r\\nand as soon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed, he, as the signal,\\r\\nwas to shut and lock one door, Townsend the other.  A third conspirator\\r\\nwas to strike a light, in case they should not be able to secure a\\r\\ncandle.  A fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted;\\r\\nand all the rest were to run to their bars, which were secreted in a\\r\\nroom; then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window, in the\\r\\nmanner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager.  Thus\\r\\neach had his part assigned, and each was warned that the success of the\\r\\nwhole depended upon their order and punctuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder and punctuality, it appears, are necessary even in a Barring Out;\\r\\nand even rebellion must have its laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long expected moment at length arrived.  De Grey and his friends,\\r\\nunconscious of what was going forward, walked out of the schoolroom as\\r\\nusual at bedtime.  The clock began to strike nine.  There was one\\r\\nGreybeard left in the room, who was packing up some of his books, which\\r\\nhad been left about by accident.  It is impossible to describe the\\r\\nimpatience with which he was watched, especially by Fisher, and the nine\\r\\nwho depended upon the gipsy oracle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had got all his books together under his arm, he let one of them\\r\\nfall; and whilst he stooped to pick it up, Archer gave the signal.  The\\r\\ndoors were shut, locked, and double-locked in an instant.  A light was\\r\\nstruck and each ran to his post.  The bars were all in the same moment\\r\\nput up to the windows, and Archer, when he had tried them all, and seen\\r\\nthat they were secure, gave a loud \"Huzza!\"--in which he was joined by\\r\\nall the party most manfully--by all but the poor Greybeard, who, the\\r\\npicture of astonishment, stood stock still in the midst of them with his\\r\\nbooks under his arm; at which spectacle Townsend, who enjoyed the FROLIC\\r\\nof the fray more than anything else, burst into an immoderate fit of\\r\\nlaughter.  \"So, my little Greybeard,\" said he, holding a candle full in\\r\\nhis eyes, \"what think you of all this?--How came you amongst the wicked\\r\\nones?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, indeed,\" said the little boy, very gravely:  \"you shut me\\r\\nup amongst you.  Won\\'t you let me out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let you out!  No, no, my little Greybeard,\" said Archer, catching hold\\r\\nof him, and dragging him to the window bars.  \"Look ye here--touch these-\\r\\n-put your hand to them--pull, push, kick--put a little spirit into it,\\r\\nman--kick like an Archer, if you can; away with ye.  It\\'s a pity that the\\r\\nking of the Greybeards is not here to admire me.  I should like to show\\r\\nhim our fortifications.  But come, my merry men all, now to the feast.\\r\\nOut with the table into the middle of the room.  Good cheer, my jolly\\r\\nArchers!  I\\'m your manager!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTownsend, delighted with the bustle, rubbed his hands, and capered about\\r\\nthe room, whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward.\\r\\n\"Four candles!--Four candles on the table.  Let\\'s have things in style\\r\\nwhen we are about it, Mr. Manager,\" cried Townsend.  \"Places!--Places!\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing like a fair scramble, my boys.  Let everyone take care of\\r\\nhimself.  Hallo! Greybeard, I\\'ve knocked Greybeard down here in the\\r\\nscuffle.  Get up again, my lad, and see a little life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Fisher, \"he sha\\'n\\'t SUP with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried the manager, \"he shan\\'t LIVE with us; a Greybeard is not\\r\\nfit company for Archers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Townsend, \"evil communication corrupts good manners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a\\r\\ncorner; and having pent him up with benches, Fisher opened his books for\\r\\nhim, which he thought the greatest mortification, and set up a candle\\r\\nbeside him--\"There, now he looks like a Greybeard as he is!\" cried they.\\r\\n\"Tell me what\\'s the Latin for cold roast beef?\" said Fisher, exultingly,\\r\\nand they returned to their feast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong and loud they revelled.  They had a few bottles of cider.  \"Give me\\r\\nthe corkscrew, the cider sha\\'n\\'t be kept till it\\'s sour,\" cried Townsend,\\r\\nin answer to the manager, who, when he beheld the provisions vanishing\\r\\nwith surprising rapidity, began to fear for the morrow.  \"Hang to-\\r\\nmorrow!\" cried Townsend, \"let Greybeards think of to-morrow; Mr. Manager,\\r\\nhere\\'s your good health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of\\r\\ntheir chief with a universal cheer.  But at the moment that the cups were\\r\\nat their lips, and as Archer bowed to thank the company, a sudden shower\\r\\nfrom above astonished the whole assembly.  They looked up, and beheld the\\r\\nrose of a watering-engine, whose long neck appeared through a trap door\\r\\nin the ceiling.  \"Your good health, Mr. Manager!\" said a voice, which was\\r\\nknown to be the gardener\\'s; and in the midst of their surprise and dismay\\r\\nthe candles were suddenly extinguished; the trap-door shut down; and they\\r\\nwere left in utter darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The DEVIL!\" said Archer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t swear, Mr. Manager,\" said the same voice from the ceiling, \"I hear\\r\\nevery word you say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mercy upon us!\" exclaimed Fisher.  \"The clock,\" added he, whispering,\\r\\n\"must have been wrong, for it had not done striking when we began.  Only,\\r\\nyou remember, Archer, it had just done before you had done locking your\\r\\ndoor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold your tongue, blockhead!\" said Archer.  \"Well, boys! were ye never\\r\\nin the dark before?  You are not afraid of a shower of rain, I hope.  Is\\r\\nanybody drowned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said they, with a faint laugh, \"but what shall we do here in the\\r\\ndark all night long, and all day to-morrow?  We can\\'t unbar the\\r\\nshutters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap-door!\" said Townsend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trap-door had indeed escaped the manager\\'s observation.  As the house\\r\\nwas new to him, and the ceiling being newly white-washed, the opening was\\r\\nscarcely perceptible.  Vexed to be out-generalled, and still more vexed\\r\\nto have it remarked, Archer poured forth a volley of incoherent\\r\\nexclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon\\r\\ndiscouraged by a trifle; and groping for the tinder-box, he asked if\\r\\nanything could be easier than to strike a light again.*  The light\\r\\nappeared.  But at the moment that it made the tinder-box visible, another\\r\\nshower from above, aimed, and aimed exactly, at the tinder-box, drenched\\r\\nit with water, and rendered it totally unfit for further service.  Archer\\r\\nin a fury dashed it to the ground.  And now for the first time he felt\\r\\nwhat it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party.  He heard in his turn\\r\\nthe murmurs of a discontented, changeable populace; and recollecting all\\r\\nhis bars and bolts, and ingenious contrivances, he was more provoked at\\r\\ntheir blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the\\r\\ndisaster itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Lucifer matches were then unknown.--Ed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my hair is all wet!\" cried one, dolefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wring it, then,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hand\\'s cut with your broken glass,\" cried another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glass!\" cried a third; \"mercy! is there broken glass? and it\\'s all\\r\\nabout, I suppose, amongst the supper; and I had but one bit of bread all\\r\\nthe time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread!\" cried Archer; \"eat if you want it.  Here\\'s a piece here, and no\\r\\nglass near it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all wet, and I don\\'t like dry bread by itself; that\\'s no feast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heigh-day!  What, nothing but moaning and grumbling!  If these are the\\r\\njoys of a Barring Out,\" cried Townsend, \"I\\'d rather be snug in my bed.  I\\r\\nexpected that we should have sat up till twelve o\\'clock, talking, and\\r\\nlaughing, and singing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you may still; what hinders you?\" said Archer.  \"Sing, and we\\'ll join\\r\\nyou, and I should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing.\\r\\nBegin, Townsend--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Come now, all ye social Powers,\\r\\n       Spread your influence o\\'er us\\'--\\r\\n\\r\\nOr else--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!\\r\\n       Britons never will be slaves.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment.  In vain they\\r\\nroared in chorus.  In vain they tried to appear gay.  It would not do.\\r\\nThe voices died away, and dropped off one by one.  They had each provided\\r\\nhimself with a great-coat to sleep upon; but now, in the dark, there was\\r\\na peevish scrambling contest for the coats, and half the company, in very\\r\\nbad humour, stretched themselves upon the benches for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of\\r\\nhardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it:  but when\\r\\npeople feel themselves foiled, there is no further pleasure in endurance;\\r\\nand if, in their misfortune, there is any mixture of the ridiculous, the\\r\\nmotives for heroism are immediately destroyed.  Dr.  Middleton had\\r\\nprobably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government\\r\\nupon his shoulders, rose early in the morning, whilst everybody else was\\r\\nfast asleep.  In the night he had resolved the affair of the trap-door,\\r\\nand a new danger had alarmed him.  It was possible that the enemy might\\r\\ndescend upon them through the trap-door.  The room had been built high to\\r\\nadmit a free circulation of air.  It was twenty feet, so that it was in\\r\\nvain to think of reaching to the trap-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the daylight appeared, Archer rose softly, that he might\\r\\nRECONNOITRE, and devise some method of guarding against this new danger.\\r\\nLuckily there were round holes in the top of the window-shutters, which\\r\\nadmitted sufficient light for him to work by.  The remains of the soaked\\r\\nfeast, wet candles, and broken glass spread over the table in the middle\\r\\nof the room, looked rather dismal this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'A pretty set of fellows I have to manage!\" said Archer, contemplating\\r\\nthe group of sleepers before him.  \"It is well they have somebody to\\r\\nthink for them.  Now if I wanted--which, thank goodness, I don\\'t--but if\\r\\nI did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance, whom could I pitch\\r\\nupon? not this stupid snorer, who is dreaming of gipsies, if he is\\r\\ndreaming of anything,\" continued Archer, as he looked into Fisher\\'s open\\r\\nmouth.  \"This next chap is quick enough; but, then, he is so fond of\\r\\nhaving everything his own way.  And this curl pated monkey, who is\\r\\ngrinning in his sleep, is all tongue and no brains.  Here are brains,\\r\\nthough nobody would think it, in this lump,\" said he, looking at a fat,\\r\\nrolled up, heavy breathing sleeper; \"but what signify brains to such a\\r\\nlazy dog?  I might kick him for my football this half hour before I\\r\\nshould get him awake.  This lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy\\r\\nfellow, to be sure; but, then, if he has hands, he has no head--and he\\'d\\r\\nbe afraid of his own shadow too, by this light, he is such a coward!  And\\r\\nTownsend, why, he has puns in plenty; but, when there\\'s any work to be\\r\\ndone, he\\'s the worst fellow to be near one in the world--he can do\\r\\nnothing but laugh at his own puns.  This poor little fellow that we\\r\\nhunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together; but\\r\\nthen he is a Greybeard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends.  And how\\r\\ndid it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this\\r\\nset, when, for each individual of which it was composed, he felt such\\r\\nsupreme contempt?  He had formed them into a PARTY, had given them a\\r\\nname, and he was at their head.  If these be not good reasons, none\\r\\nbetter can be assigned for Archer\\'s conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish ye could all sleep on,\" said he; \"but I must waken ye, though you\\r\\nwill be only in my way.  The sound of my hammering must waken them; so I\\r\\nmay as well do the thing handsomely, and flatter some of them by\\r\\npretending to ask their advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, he pulled two or three to waken them.  \"Come, Townsend,\\r\\nwaken, my boy!  Here\\'s some diversion for you--up! up!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Diversion!\" cried Townsend; \"I\\'m your man!  I\\'m up--UP TO ANYTHING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, under the name of DIVERSION, Archer set Townsend to work at four\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning.  They had nails, a few tools, and several spars,\\r\\nstill left from the wreck of the playhouse.  These, by Archer\\'s\\r\\ndirections, they sharpened at one end, and nailed them to the ends of\\r\\nseveral forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll hands were now called to clear away the supper things, to erect these\\r\\nforms perpendicularly under the trap-door; and with the assistance of a\\r\\nfew braces, a chevaux-de-frise was formed, upon which nobody could\\r\\nventure to descend.  At the farthest end of the room they likewise formed\\r\\na penthouse of the tables, under which they proposed to breakfast, secure\\r\\nfrom the pelting storm, if it should again assail them through the trap-\\r\\ndoor.  They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready, and\\r\\ntheir admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord! I shall like to see the gardener\\'s phiz through the trap-door,\\r\\nwhen he beholds the spikes under him!\" cried Townsend.  \"Now for\\r\\nbreakfast!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, now for breakfast,\" said Archer, looking at his watch; \"past eight\\r\\no\\'clock, and my town boys not come!  I don\\'t understand this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who\\r\\nlived in the town, who were cousins of his, and who had promised to come\\r\\nevery day, and put food in at a certain hole in the wall, in which a\\r\\nventilator usually turned.  This ventilator Archer had taken down, and\\r\\nhad contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at\\r\\npleasure; but, upon examination, it was now perceived that the hole had\\r\\nbeen newly stopped up by an iron back, which it was impossible to\\r\\npenetrate or remove.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the\\r\\nventilator but myself!\" exclaimed Archer, in great perplexity.  He\\r\\nlistened and waited for his cousins; but no cousins came, and at a late\\r\\nhour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments\\r\\nof the last night\\'s feast.  That feast had been spread with such\\r\\nimprudent profusion, that little now remained to satisfy the hungry\\r\\nguests.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity\\r\\nwould have upon his associates, did everything that could be done by a\\r\\nbold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his\\r\\ncousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only\\r\\ndelayed.  The delay, however, was alarming.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher alone heard the manager\\'s calculations and saw the public fears\\r\\nunmoved.  Secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom, he walked from window to\\r\\nwindow, slily listening for the gipsy\\'s signal.  \"There it is!\" cried he\\r\\nwith more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them\\r\\nbefore.  \"Come this way, Archer; but don\\'t tell anybody.  Hark! do ye\\r\\nhear those three taps at the window?  This is the old woman with twelve\\r\\nbuns for me.  I\\'ll give you one whole one for yourself, if you will unbar\\r\\nthe window for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unbar the window!\" interrupted Archer; \"no, that I won\\'t, for you or the\\r\\ngipsy either; but I have heard enough to get your buns without that.  But\\r\\nstay; there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns.  I\\r\\nmust think for ye all, I see, regularly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he summoned a council, and proposed that everyone should subscribe,\\r\\nand trust the subscription to the gipsy, to purchase a fresh supply of\\r\\nprovisions.  Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his\\r\\nsubscription; at which sight all the company clapped their hands, and his\\r\\npopularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty.  Now,\\r\\nhaving made a list of their wants, they folded the money in the paper,\\r\\nput it into a bag, which Archer tied to a long string, and, having broken\\r\\nthe pane of glass behind the round hole in the window-shutter, he let\\r\\ndown the bag to the gipsy.  She promised to be punctual, and having\\r\\nfilled the bag with Fisher\\'s twelve buns, they were drawn up in triumph,\\r\\nand everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the\\r\\nsame bag drawn up at dinner-time.  The buns were a little squeezed in\\r\\nbeing drawn through the hole in the window-shutter; but Archer\\r\\nimmediately sawed out a piece of the shutter, and broke the corresponding\\r\\npanes in each of the other windows, to prevent suspicion, and to make it\\r\\nappear that they had all been broken to admit air.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no\\r\\npurpose!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so\\r\\npunctual to her promise to Fisher, but we must recollect that her\\r\\napparent integrity was only cunning; she was punctual that she might be\\r\\nemployed again, that she might be intrusted with the contribution which,\\r\\nshe foresaw, must be raised amongst the famishing garrison.  No sooner\\r\\nhad she received the money than her end was gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner-time came; it struck three, four, five, six.  They listened with\\r\\nhungry ears, but no signal was heard.  The morning had been very long,\\r\\nand Archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the\\r\\nremainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply.  And\\r\\nnow those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of\\r\\ntheir disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, in the division of the food, had attempted, by the most\\r\\nscrupulous exactness, to content the public, and he was both astonished\\r\\nand provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached.  So\\r\\ndifferently do people judge in different situations!  He was the first\\r\\nperson to accuse his master of injustice, and the least capable of\\r\\nbearing such an imputation upon himself from others.  He now experienced\\r\\nsome of the joys of power, and the delight of managing unreasonable\\r\\nnumbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have not I done everything I could to please you?  Have not I spent my\\r\\nmoney to buy you food?  Have not I divided the last morsel with you?  I\\r\\nhave not tasted one mouthful today!  Did not I set to work for you at\\r\\nsunrise?  Did not I lie awake all night for you?  Have not I had all the\\r\\nlabour, and all the anxiety?  Look round and see MY contrivances, MY\\r\\nwork, MY generosity!  And, after all, you think me a tyrant, because I\\r\\nwant you to have common sense.  Is not this bun which I hold in my hand\\r\\nmy own?  Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce\"\\r\\n(pointing to Fisher), \"who could never have gotten one of his twelve\\r\\nbuns, if I had not shown him how?  Eleven of them he has eaten since\\r\\nmorning for his own share, without offering anyone a morsel; but I scorn\\r\\nto eat even what is justly my own, when I see so many hungry creatures\\r\\nlonging for it.  I was not going to touch this last morsel myself.  I\\r\\nonly begged you to keep it till supper-time, when perhaps you\\'ll want it\\r\\nmore, and Townsend, who can\\'t bear the slightest thing that crosses his\\r\\nown whims, and who thinks there\\'s nothing in this world to be minded but\\r\\nhis own diversion, calls me a TYRANT.  You all of you promised to obey\\r\\nme.  The first thing I ask you to do for your own good, and when, if you\\r\\nhad common sense, you must know I can want nothing but your good, you\\r\\nrebel against me.  Traitors! fools! ungrateful fools!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher walked up and down, unable to command his emotion, whilst, for the\\r\\nmoment, the discontented multitude was silenced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said he, striking his hand upon the little boy\\'s shoulder,\\r\\n\"here\\'s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach\\r\\nor complaint, and he has had but one bit of bread--a bit that I gave him\\r\\nmyself this day.  Here!\" said he, snatching the bun, which nobody had\\r\\ndared to touch, \"take it--it\\'s mine--I give it to you, though you are a\\r\\nGreybeard; you deserve it.  Eat it, and be an Archer.  You shall be my\\r\\ncaptain; will you?\" said he, lifting him up in his arm above the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like you now,\" said the little boy, courageously; \"but I love De Grey\\r\\nbetter; he has always been my friend, and he advised me never to call\\r\\nmyself any of those names, Archer or Greybeard; so I won\\'t.  Though I am\\r\\nshut in here, I have nothing to do with it.  I love Dr.  Middleton; he\\r\\nwas never unjust to ME, and I daresay that he has very good reasons, as\\r\\nDe Grey said, for forbidding us to go into that house.  Besides, it\\'s his\\r\\nown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad,\\r\\nArcher suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands.  He\\r\\nflung it at a hole in the window, but it fell back.  The Archers\\r\\nscrambled for it, and Fisher ate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher saw this, and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in\\r\\nsuffering it.  A few moments ago he had admired his own generosity, and\\r\\nthough he had felt the injustice of others, he had not accused himself of\\r\\nany.  He turned away from the little boy, and sitting down at one end of\\r\\nthe table, hid his face in his hands.  He continued immovable in this\\r\\nposture for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord!\" said Townsend; \"it was an excellent joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!\" said Fisher; \"what a fool, to think so much about a bun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind, Mr. Archer, if you are thinking about me,\" said the little\\r\\nboy, trying gently to pull his hands from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher stooped down, and lifted him up upon the table, at which sight the\\r\\npartisans set up a general hiss.  \"He has forsaken us!  He deserts his\\r\\nparty!  He wants to be a Greybeard!  After he has got us all into this\\r\\nscrape, he will leave us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to leave you,\" cried Archer.  \"No one shall ever accuse\\r\\nme of deserting my party.  I\\'ll stick by the Archers, right or wrong, I\\r\\ntell you, to the last moment.  But this little fellow--take it as you\\r\\nplease, mutiny if you will, and throw me out of the window.  Call me\\r\\ntraitor! coward! Greybeard!--this little fellow is worth you all put\\r\\ntogether, and I\\'ll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger\\r\\nupon him; and the next morsel of food that I see shall be his.  Touch him\\r\\nwho dares!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked, and the belief\\r\\nthat the little boy deserved his protection, silenced the crowd.  But the\\r\\nstorm was only hushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sound of merriment was now to be heard--no battledore and shuttlecock-\\r\\n-no ball, no marbles.  Some sat in a corner, whispering their wishes that\\r\\nArcher would unbar the doors, and give up.  Others, stretching their\\r\\narms, and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room, wished for air,\\r\\nor food, or water.  Fisher and his nine, who had such firm dependence\\r\\nupon the gipsy, now gave themselves up to utter despair.  It was eight\\r\\no\\'clock, growing darker and darker every minute, and no candles, no light\\r\\ncould they have.  The prospect of another long dark night made them still\\r\\nmore discontented.\\r\\n\\r\\nTownsend, at the head of the yawners, and Fisher, at the head of the\\r\\nhungry malcontents, gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered\\r\\nspirits, demanding \"How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon?\\r\\nand whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest.\\r\\nHe saw that the majority, his own convincing argument, was against him.\\r\\nHe was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion.  He\\r\\nflattered some with hopes of food from the town boys.  Some he reminded\\r\\nof their promises; others he praised for former prowess; and others he\\r\\nshamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT.  With\\r\\nthis determination they stretched themselves again to sleep, for the\\r\\nsecond night, in weak and weary obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning, and\\r\\nwhen he awoke, he found his hands tied behind him!  Three or four boys\\r\\nhad just got hold of his feet, which they pressed down, whilst the\\r\\ntrembling hands of Fisher were fastening the cord round them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the force which rage could inspire, Archer struggled and roared\\r\\nto \"HIS ARCHERS!\"--his friends, his party--for help against the traitors.\\r\\nBut all kept aloof.  Townsend, in particular, stood laughing and looking\\r\\non.  \"I beg your pardon, Archer, but really you look so droll.  All alive\\r\\nand kicking!  Don\\'t be angry.  I\\'m so weak, I cannot help laughing\\r\\ntoday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe packthread cracked.  \"His hands are free!  He\\'s loose!\" cried the\\r\\nleast of the boys, and ran away, whilst Archer leaped up, and seizing\\r\\nhold of Fisher with a powerful grasp, sternly demanded \"What he meant by\\r\\nthis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask my party,\" said Fisher, terrified; \"they set me on; ask my party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your party!\" cried Archer, with a look of ineffable contempt; \"you\\r\\nreptile!--YOUR party?  Can such a thing as YOU have a party?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure!\" said Fisher, settling his collar, which Archer in his\\r\\nsurprise had let go; \"to be sure!  Why not?  Any man who chooses it may\\r\\nhave a party as well as yourself, I suppose.  I have nine Fishermen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, spoken with much sullen importance, Archer, in spite of\\r\\nhis vexation, could not help laughing.  \"Fishermen!\" cried he,\\r\\n\"FISHERMEN!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why not Fishermen as well as Archers?\" cried they.  \"One party is\\r\\njust as good as another; it is only a question which can get the upper\\r\\nhand; and we had your hands tied just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Townsend,\" said Archer, \"laugh on, my boy!  Friend or foe,\\r\\nit\\'s all the same to you.  I know how to value your friendship now.  You\\r\\nare a mighty good fellow when the sun shines; but let a storm come, and\\r\\nhow you slink away!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Archer felt the difference between A GOOD COMPANION and\\r\\na good friend, a difference which some people do not discover till late\\r\\nin life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have I no friend?--no real friend amongst you all?  And could ye stand\\r\\nby, and see my hands tied behind me like a thief\\'s?  What signifies such\\r\\na party--all mute?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want something to eat,\" answered the Fishermen.  \"What signifies SUCH\\r\\na party, indeed? and SUCH a manager, who can do nothing for one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have _I_ done nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let\\'s hear any more prosing,\" said Fisher; \"we are too many for\\r\\nyou.  I\\'ve advised my party, if they\\'ve a mind not to be starved, to give\\r\\nyou up for the ringleader, as you were; and Dr. Middleton will not let us\\r\\nall off, I daresay.\"  So, depending upon the sullen silence of the\\r\\nassembly, he again approached Archer with a cord.  A cry of \"No, no, no!\\r\\nDon\\'t tie him,\" was feebly raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher stood still, but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down\\r\\nto the ground, and turning to the rest, with eyes sparkling with\\r\\nindignation, \"Archers!\" cried he.  A voice at this instant was heard at\\r\\nthe door.  It was De Grey\\'s voice.  \"I have got a large basket of\\r\\nprovisions for your breakfast.\"  A general shout of joy was sent forth by\\r\\nthe voracious public.  \"Breakfast!  Provisions!  A large basket!  De Grey\\r\\nfor ever!  Huzza!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey promised, upon his honour, that if he would unbar the door nobody\\r\\nshould come in with him, and no advantage should be taken of them.  This\\r\\npromise was enough even for Archer.  \"I will let him in,\" said he,\\r\\n\"myself; for I\\'m sure he\\'ll never break his word.\"  He pulled away the\\r\\nbar; the door opened, and having bargained for the liberty of Melson, the\\r\\nlittle boy, who had been shut in by mistake, De Grey entered with his\\r\\nbasket of provisions, when he locked and barred the door instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket, and\\r\\nspread the table with a plentiful breakfast.  A hundred questions were\\r\\nasked him at once.  \"Eat first,\" said he, \"and we will talk afterwards.\"\\r\\nThis business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for\\r\\na long while.  Their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished.\\r\\n\"Who sent us breakfast?  Does Dr. Middleton know?\" were questions\\r\\nreiterated from every mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does know,\" answered De Grey; \"and the first thing I have to tell you\\r\\nis, that I am your fellow-prisoner.  I am to stay here till you give up.\\r\\nThis was the only condition on which Dr. Middleton would allow me to\\r\\nbring you food, and he will allow no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone looked at the empty basket.  But Archer, in whom half vanquished\\r\\nparty spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast,\\r\\nbroke into exclamations in praise of De Grey\\'s magnanimity, as he now\\r\\nimagined that De Grey had become one of themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will join us, will you?  That\\'s a noble fellow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" answered De Grey, calmly; \"but I hope to persuade, or rather to\\r\\nconvince you, that you ought to join me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us,\\r\\nwhichever you pleased,\" said Townsend, \"if you had appealed to Archers\\r\\nfasting; but Archers feasting are quite other animals.  Even Caesar\\r\\nhimself, after breakfast, is quite another thing!\" added he, pointing to\\r\\nArcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may speak for yourself, Mr. Townsend,\" replied the insulted hero,\\r\\n\"but not for me, or for Archers in general, if you please.  We unbarred\\r\\nthe door upon the faith of De Grey\\'s promise--THAT was not giving up.\\r\\nAnd it would have been just as difficult, I promise you, to persuade or\\r\\nconvince me either that I should give up against my honour before\\r\\nbreakfast as after.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis spirited speech was applauded by many, who had now forgotten the\\r\\nfeelings of famine.  Not so Fisher, whose memory was upon this occasion\\r\\nvery distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What nonsense,\" and the orator paused for a synonymous expression, but\\r\\nnone was at hand.  \"What nonsense and--nonsense is here!  Why, don\\'t you\\r\\nremember that dinner-time, and supper-time and breakfast-time will come\\r\\nagain?  So what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing?  We\\r\\nwill not go through again what we did yesterday!  Honour me no honour.  I\\r\\ndon\\'t understand it.  I\\'d rather be flogged at once, as I have been\\r\\nmany\\'s the good time for a less thing.  I say, we\\'d better all be flogged\\r\\nat once, which must be the end of it sooner or later, than wait here to\\r\\nbe without dinner, breakfast, and supper, all only because Mr. Archer\\r\\nwon\\'t give up because of his honour and nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate at the\\r\\nclose of this oration, in which the arguments were brought so \"home to\\r\\neach man\\'s business and bosom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said De Grey, \"when we yield, I hope it will not be merely to get\\r\\nour dinner, gentlemen.  When we yield, Archer--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t address yourself to me,\" interrupted Archer, struggling with his\\r\\npride; \"you have no further occasion to try to win me.  I have no power,\\r\\nno party, you see!  And now I find that I have no friends, I don\\'t care\\r\\nwhat becomes of myself.  I suppose I\\'m to be given up as a ringleader.\\r\\nHere\\'s this Fisher, and a party of his Fishermen, were going to tie me\\r\\nhand and foot, if I had not knocked him down, just as you came to the\\r\\ndoor, De Grey; and now perhaps you will join Fisher\\'s party against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any\\r\\nparty, when a sudden change appeared on Archer\\'s countenance.  \"Silence!\"\\r\\ncried Archer, in an imperious tone, and there was silence.  Someone was\\r\\nheard to whistle the beginning of a tune, that was perfectly new to\\r\\neverybody present, except to Archer, who immediately whistled the\\r\\nconclusion.  \"There!\" cried he, looking at De Grey, with triumph; \"that\\'s\\r\\na method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner, which I\\r\\nlearned from \\'Richard Coeur de Lion.\\'  I know how to make use of\\r\\neverything.  Hallo! friend! are you there at last?\" cried he, going to\\r\\nthe ventilator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but we are barred out here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Round to the window then, and fill our bag.  We\\'ll let it down, my lad,\\r\\nin a trice; bar me out who can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher let down the bag with all the expedition of joy, and it was filled\\r\\nwith all the expedition of fear.  \"Pull away! make haste, for Heaven\\'s\\r\\nsake!\" said the voice from without; \"the gardener will come from dinner,\\r\\nelse, and we shall be caught.  He mounted guard all yesterday at the\\r\\nventilator; and though I watched and watched till it was darker than\\r\\npitch, I could not get near you.  I don\\'t know what has taken him out of\\r\\nthe way now.  Make haste, pull away!\"  The heavy bag was soon pulled up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any more?\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, plenty.  Let down quick!  I\\'ve got the tailor\\'s bag full, which is\\r\\nthree times as large as yours, and I\\'ve changed clothes with the tailor\\'s\\r\\nboy; so nobody took notice of me as I came down the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s my own cousin!\" exclaimed Archer, \"there\\'s a noble fellow!\\r\\nthere\\'s my own cousin, I acknowledge.  Fill the bag, then.\"  Several\\r\\ntimes the bag descended and ascended; and at every unlading of the crane,\\r\\nfresh acclamations were heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no more!\" at length the boy with the tailor\\'s bag cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you, then; we\\'ve enough, and thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA delightful review was now made of their treasure.  Busy hands arranged\\r\\nand sorted the heterogeneous mass.  Archer, in the height of his glory,\\r\\nlooked on, the acknowledged master of the whole.  Townsend, who, in his\\r\\nprosperity as in adversity, saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his\\r\\nfriends, pushed De Grey, who was looking on with a more good-natured and\\r\\nmore thoughtful air.  \"Friend,\" said he, \"you look like a great\\r\\nphilosopher, and Archer a great hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Townsend,\" said Archer, \"may look like a wit, if you will; but\\r\\nyou will never be a hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" replied Townsend; \"wits were never heroes, because they are\\r\\nwits.  You are out of your wits, and therefore may set up for a hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh, and welcome.  I\\'m not a tyrant.  I don\\'t want to restrain\\r\\nanybody\\'s wit; but I cannot say I admire puns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, either,\" said the time serving Fisher, sidling up to the manager,\\r\\nand picking the ice off a piece of plum-cake, \"nor I either; I hate puns.\\r\\nI can never understand Townsend\\'s PUNS.  Besides, anybody can make puns;\\r\\nand one doesn\\'t want wit, either, at all times; for instance, when one is\\r\\ngoing to settle about dinner, or business of consequence.  Bless us all,\\r\\nArcher!\" continued he, with sudden familiarity; \"WHAT A SIGHT OF GOOD\\r\\nTHINGS ARE HERE!  I\\'m sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin.  I\\r\\nnever thought he\\'d have come.  Why, now we can hold out as long as you\\r\\nplease.  Let us see,\" said he, dividing the provisions upon the table;\\r\\n\"we can hold out to-day, and all to-morrow, and part of next day, maybe.\\r\\nWhy, now we may defy the doctor and the Greybeards.  The doctor will\\r\\nsurely give up to us; for, you see, he knows nothing of all this, and\\r\\nhe\\'ll think we are starving all this while; and he\\'d be afraid, you see,\\r\\nto let us starve quite, in reality, for three whole days, because of what\\r\\nwould be said in the town.  My Aunt Barbara, for one, would be AT HIM\\r\\nlong before that time was out; and besides, you know, in that case, he\\'d\\r\\nbe hanged for murder, which is quite another thing, in law, from a\\r\\nBARRING OUT, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher had not given to this harangue all the attention which it\\r\\ndeserved, for his eye was fixed upon De Grey.  \"What is De Grey thinking\\r\\nof?\" he asked, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking,\" said De Grey, \"that Dr. Middleton must believe that I\\r\\nhave betrayed his confidence in me.  The gardener was ordered away from\\r\\nhis watch-post for one half-hour when I was admitted.  This half-hour the\\r\\ngardener has made nearly a hour.  I never would have come near you if I\\r\\nhad foreseen all this.  Dr. Middleton trusted me, and now he will repent\\r\\nof his confidence in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De Grey!\" cried Archer, with energy, \"he shall not repent of his\\r\\nconfidence in you--nor shall you repent of coming amongst us. You shall\\r\\nfind that we have some honour as well as yourself, and I will take care\\r\\nof your honour as if it were my OWN!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey-day!\" interrupted Townsend; \"are heroes allowed to change sides,\\r\\npray?  And does the chief of the Archers stand talking sentiment to the\\r\\nchief of the Greybeards?  In the middle of his own party too!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Party!\" repeated Archer, disdainfully; \"I have done with parties!  I see\\r\\nwhat parties are made of!  I have felt the want of a friend, and I am\\r\\ndetermined to make one if I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you may do,\" said De Grey, stretching out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unbar the doors! unbar the windows!\" exclaimed Archer.  \"Away with all\\r\\nthese things!  I give up for De Grey\\'s sake.  He shall not lose his\\r\\ncredit on my account.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said De Grey, \"you shall not give up for my sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll give up to do what is HONOURABLE,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not to do what is REASONABLE?\" said De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"REASONABLE!  Oh, the first thing that a man of spirit should think of\\r\\nis, what is HONOURABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how will he find out WHAT IS honourable, unless he can reason?\"\\r\\nreplied De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Archer, \"his own feelings always tell him what is honourable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have not YOUR FEELINGS,\" asked De Grey, \"changed within these few\\r\\nhours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, with circumstances,\" replied Archer; \"but right or wrong, as long\\r\\nas I think it honourable to do so and so, I\\'m satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you cannot think anything honourable, or the contrary,\" observed De\\r\\nGrey, \"without reasoning; and as to what you call feeling, it\\'s only a\\r\\nquick sort of reasoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The quicker, the better,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not,\" said De Grey.  \"We are apt to reason best when we are not\\r\\nin quite so great a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Archer, \"we have not always time enough to reason AT FIRST.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must, however, acknowledge,\" replied De Grey, smiling, \"that no man\\r\\nbut a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong AT LAST.  Is it not,\\r\\ntherefore, best to begin by reasoning to find out the right AT FIRST?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you reason with yourself at first?  And did you find out that it\\r\\nwas right to bar Dr. Middleton out of his own schoolroom, because he\\r\\ndesired you not to go into one of his own houses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Archer; \"but I should never have thought of heading a\\r\\nBarring Out, if he had not shown partiality; and if you had flown into a\\r\\npassion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery, which would\\r\\nhave been quite natural, and not have gone slily and forbid us the house\\r\\nout of revenge, there would have been none of this work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said De Grey, \"should you suspect me of such a mean action, when\\r\\nyou have never seen or known me do anything mean, and when in this\\r\\ninstance you have no proofs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me your word and honour now, De Grey, before everybody\\r\\nhere, that you did not do what I suspected?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, upon my honour, I never, indirectly, spoke to Dr.\\r\\nMiddleton about the playhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Archer, \"I\\'m as glad as if I had found a thousand pounds!\\r\\nNow you are my friend indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Dr. Middleton--why should you suspect him without reason any more\\r\\nthan me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to that,\" said Archer, \"he is your friend, and you are right to\\r\\ndefend him; and I won\\'t say another word against him.  Will that satisfy\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite!  Then, indeed you are unreasonable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied De Grey; \"for I don\\'t wish you to yield out of friendship\\r\\nto me, any more than to honour.  If you yield to reason, you will be\\r\\ngoverned by reason another time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well; but then don\\'t triumph over me, because you have the best side of\\r\\nthe argument.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I!  How can I?\" said De Grey; \"for now you are on THE BEST SIDE as\\r\\nwell as myself, are not you?  So we may triumph together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good friend!\" said Archer; and with great eagerness he pulled\\r\\ndown the fortifications, whilst every hand assisted.  The room was\\r\\nrestored to order in a few minutes--the shutters were thrown open, the\\r\\ncheerful light let in.  The windows were thrown up, and the first feeling\\r\\nof the fresh air was delightful.  The green playgound opened before them,\\r\\nand the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of\\r\\nthese voluntary prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! they were not yet at liberty.  The idea of Dr. Middleton, and\\r\\nthe dread of his vengeance, smote their hearts.  When the rebels had sent\\r\\nan ambassador with their surrender, they stood in pale and silent\\r\\nsuspense, waiting for their doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Fisher, looking up at the broken panes in the windows, \"the\\r\\ndoctor will think the most of THAT--he\\'ll never forgive us for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush! here he comes!\"  His steady step was heard approaching nearer and\\r\\nnearer.  Archer threw open the door, and Dr. Middleton entered.  Fisher\\r\\ninstantly fell on his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no delight to me to see people on their knees.  Stand up, Mr.\\r\\nFisher.  I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Archer, \"they are conscious that they have done wrong, and so\\r\\nam I.  I am the ringleader.  Punish me as you think proper.  I submit.\\r\\nYour punishments--your vengeance ought to fall on me alone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Dr. Middleton, calmly, \"I perceive that whatever else you may\\r\\nhave learned in the course of your education, you have not been taught\\r\\nthe meaning of the word punishment.  Punishment and vengeance do not with\\r\\nus mean the same thing.  PUNISHMENT is pain given, with the reasonable\\r\\nhope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing, IN FUTURE,\\r\\nwhat will hurt themselves or others.  VENGEANCE never looks to the\\r\\nFUTURE, but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past.  I\\r\\nfeel no anger; you have done me no injury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows.  \"Yes, I\\r\\nsee that you have broken my windows; that is a small evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir!  How good!  How merciful!\" exclaimed those who had been most\\r\\npanic-struck.  \"He forgives us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" resumed Dr. Middleton; \"I cannot forgive you.  I shall never\\r\\nrevenge, but it is my duty to punish.  You have rebelled against the just\\r\\nauthority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have\\r\\nnot sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves.  Without\\r\\nobedience to the laws,\" added he, turning to Archer, \"as men, you cannot\\r\\nbe suffered in society.  You, sir, think yourself a man, I observe; and\\r\\nyou think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another.  I\\r\\nhave no pleasure in making others, whether men or children, submit to my\\r\\nWILL; but my reason and experience are superior to yours.  Your parents\\r\\nat least think so, or they would not have intrusted me with the care of\\r\\nyour education.  As long as they do intrust you to my care, and as long\\r\\nas I have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment, I shall\\r\\nsteadily inflict it, whenever I judge it to be necessary, and I judge it\\r\\nto be necessary NOW.  This is a long sermon, Mr. Archer, not preached to\\r\\nshow my own eloquence, but to convince your understanding.  Now, as to\\r\\nyour punishment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Name it, sir,\" said Archer;  \"whatever it is, I will cheerfully submit\\r\\nto it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Name it yourself,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"and show me that you now\\r\\nunderstand the nature of punishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, proud to be treated like a reasonable creature, and sorry that he\\r\\nhad behaved like a foolish schoolboy, was silent for some time, but at\\r\\nlength replied, \"That he would rather not name his own punishment.\"  He\\r\\nrepeated, however, that he trusted he should bear it well, whatever it\\r\\nmight be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall, then,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"deprive you, for two months, of\\r\\npocket-money, as you have had too much, and have made a bad use of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Archer, \"I brought five guineas with me to school.  This\\r\\nguinea is all that I have left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of\\r\\napprobation, and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the\\r\\nschoolroom.  The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor\\'s\\r\\nsentence against them, but not with those looks of abject fear with which\\r\\nboys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall return from the playground, all of you,\" said Dr. Middleton,\\r\\n\"one quarter of an hour sooner, for two months to come, than the rest of\\r\\nyour companions.  A bell shall ring at the appointed time.  I give you an\\r\\nopportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir! we will come the instant, the very instant the bell rings; you\\r\\nshall have confidence in us,\" cried they, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve your confidence, I hope,\" said Dr. Middleton; \"for it is my\\r\\nfirst wish to make you all happy.  You do not know the pain that it has\\r\\ncost me to deprive you of food for so many hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the boys, with one accord, ran to the place where they had deposited\\r\\ntheir last supplies.  Archer delivered them up to the doctor, proud to\\r\\nshow that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reason,\" resumed Dr. Middleton, having now returned to the usual\\r\\nbenignity of his manner--\"the reason why I desired that none of you\\r\\nshould go to that building,\" pointing out of the window, \"was this:--I\\r\\nhad been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before\\r\\nI spoke to you, one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever.  I did\\r\\nnot choose to mention my reason to you or your friends.  I have had the\\r\\nplace cleaned, and you may return to it when you please.  The gipsies\\r\\nwere yesterday removed from the town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De Grey, you were in the right,\" whispered Archer, \"and it was I that\\r\\nwas UNJUST.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old woman,\" continued the doctor, \"whom you employed to buy food,\\r\\nhas escaped the fever, but she has not escaped a gaol, whither she was\\r\\nsent yesterday, for having defrauded you of your money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Fisher,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"as to you, I shall not punish you; I\\r\\nhave no hope of making you either wiser or better.  Do you know this\\r\\npaper?\"--the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder-box.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desired him to buy those things, sir,\" said Archer, colouring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you desire him not to pay for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Archer, \"he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know he had, but he chose to apply it to his private use, and gave it\\r\\nto the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating.  To obtain credit for\\r\\nthe tinder-box and candles, he made use of THIS name,\" said he, turning\\r\\nto the other side of the bill, and pointing to De Grey\\'s name, which was\\r\\nwritten at the end of a copy of one of De Grey\\'s exercises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, sir--\" cried Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not assure me, sir,\" said Dr. Middleton; \"I cannot suspect a\\r\\nboy of your temper of having any part in so base an action.  When the\\r\\npeople in the shop refused to let Mr. Fisher have the things without\\r\\npaying for them, he made use of De Grey\\'s name, who was known there.\\r\\nSuspecting some mischief, however, from the purchase of the tinder-box,\\r\\nthe shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance.  Nothing in this whole\\r\\nbusiness gave me half so much pain as I felt, for a moment, when I\\r\\nsuspected that De Grey was concerned in it.\"  A loud cry, in which\\r\\nArcher\\'s voice was heard most distinctly, declared De Grey\\'s innocence.\\r\\nDr. Middleton looked round at their eager, honest faces, with benevolent\\r\\napprobation.  \"Archer,\" said he, taking him by the hand, \"I am heartily\\r\\nglad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit.  I wish\\r\\nyou may keep such a friend as you have now beside you; one such friend is\\r\\nworth two such parties.  As for you, Mr. Fisher, depart; you must never\\r\\nreturn hither again.\"  In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to\\r\\nintercede for him.  Everybody turned away with contempt; and he sneaked\\r\\nout, whimpering in a doleful voice, \"What shall I say to my Aunt\\r\\nBarbara?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BRACELETS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a beautiful and retired part of England lived Mrs. Villars, a lady\\r\\nwhose accurate understanding, benevolent heart, and steady temper\\r\\npeculiarly fitted her for the most difficult, as well as most important,\\r\\nof all occupations--the education of youth.  This task she had\\r\\nundertaken; and twenty young persons were put under her care, with the\\r\\nperfect confidence of their parents.  No young people could be happier;\\r\\nthey were good and gay, emulous, but not envious of each other; for Mrs.\\r\\nVillars was impartially just; her praise they felt to be the reward of\\r\\nmerit, and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill-\\r\\nconduct.  To the one, therefore, they patiently submitted, and in the\\r\\nother consciously rejoiced.  They rose with fresh cheerfulness in the\\r\\nmorning, eager to pursue their various occupations.  They returned in the\\r\\nevening with renewed ardour to their amusements, and retired to rest\\r\\nsatisfied with themselves and pleased with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this\\r\\nlittle society as a small honorary distinction, given annually, as a\\r\\nprize of successful application.  The prize this year was peculiarly dear\\r\\nto each individual, as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly\\r\\nloved.  It was the picture of Mrs. Villars in a small bracelet.  It\\r\\nwanted neither gold, pearls nor precious stones to give it value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two foremost candidates for this prize were Cecilia and Leonora.\\r\\nCecilia was the most intimate friend of Leonora; but Leonora was only the\\r\\nfavourite companion of Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was of an active, ambitious, enterprising disposition, more eager\\r\\nin the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes.  Leonora was of\\r\\na contented, unaspiring temperate character; not easily roused to action,\\r\\nbut indefatigable when once excited.  Leonora was proud; Cecilia was\\r\\nvain.  Her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others,\\r\\nand therefore more anxious to please than Leonora; but that very vanity\\r\\nmade her, at the same time, more apt to offend.  In short, Leonora was\\r\\nthe most anxious to avoid what was wrong;  Cecilia, the most ambitious to\\r\\ndo what was right.  Few of her companions loved, but many were led by\\r\\nCecilia, for she was often successful.  Many loved Leonora, but none were\\r\\never governed by her, for she was too indolent to govern.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first day of May, about six o\\'clock in the evening, a great bell\\r\\nrang, to summon this little society into a hall, where the prize was to\\r\\nbe decided.  A number of small tables were placed in a circle in the\\r\\nmiddle of the hall.  Seats for the young competitors were raised one\\r\\nabove another, in a semicircle, some yards distant from the table, and\\r\\nthe judges\\' chairs, under canopies of lilacs and laburnums, forming\\r\\nanother semicircle, closed the amphitheatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone put their writings, their drawings, their works of various kinds\\r\\nupon the tables appropriated for each.  How unsteady were the last steps\\r\\nto these tables!  How each little hand trembled as it laid down its\\r\\nclaims!  Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success; and\\r\\nthe heart, which exulted with hope, now palpitated with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe works were examined, the preference adjudged, and the prize was\\r\\ndeclared to be the happy Cecilia\\'s.  Mrs. Villars came forward, smiling,\\r\\nwith the bracelet in her hand.  Cecilia was behind her companions, on the\\r\\nhighest row.  All the others gave way, and she was on the floor in an\\r\\ninstant.  Mrs. Villars clasped the bracelet on her arm; the clasp was\\r\\nheard through the whole hall, and a universal smile of congratulation\\r\\nfollowed.  Mrs. Villars kissed Cecilia\\'s little hand.  \"And now,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"go and rejoice with your companions; the remainder of the day is\\r\\nyours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! you whose hearts are elated with success, whose bosoms beat high with\\r\\njoy in the moment of triumph, command yourselves.  Let that triumph be\\r\\nmoderate, that it may be lasting.  Consider, that though you are good,\\r\\nyou may be better; and, though wise, you may be weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Mrs. Villars had given her the bracelet, all Cecilia\\'s little\\r\\ncompanions crowded round her, and they all left the hall in an instant.\\r\\nShe was full of spirits and vanity.  She ran on.  Running down the flight\\r\\nof steps which led to the garden, in her violent haste, Cecilia threw\\r\\ndown the little Louisa, who had a china mandarin in her hand, which her\\r\\nmother had sent her that very morning, and which was all broken to pieces\\r\\nby her fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my mandarin!\" cried Louisa, bursting into tears.  The crowd behind\\r\\nCecilia suddenly stopped.  Louisa sat on the lowest step, fixing her eyes\\r\\nupon the broken pieces.  Then, turning round, she hid her face in her\\r\\nhands upon the step above her.  In turning, Louisa threw down the remains\\r\\nof the mandarin.  The head, which she placed in the socket, fell from the\\r\\nshoulders, and rolled, bounding along the gravel walk.  Cecilia pointed\\r\\nto the head and to the socket, and burst into laughter.  The crowd behind\\r\\nlaughed, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa;\\r\\nbut Cecilia had just been successful, and sympathy with the victorious\\r\\noften makes us forget justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, however, preserved her usual consistency.  \"Poor Louisa!\" said\\r\\nshe, looking first at her, and then reproachfully at Cecilia.  Cecilia\\r\\nturned sharply round, colouring, half with shame and half with vexation.\\r\\n\"I could not help it, Leonora,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you could have helped laughing, Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t laugh at Louisa; and I surely may laugh, for it does nobody any\\r\\nharm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure, however,\" replied Leonora, \"I should not have laughed if I\\r\\nhad--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure, you wouldn\\'t, because Louisa is your favourite.  I can\\r\\nbuy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door, if\\r\\nthat\\'s all.  I CAN do no more, CAN I?\" said she, again turning round to\\r\\nher companions.  \"No, to be sure,\" said they; \"that\\'s all fair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora.  Leonora let go her hand; she ran\\r\\non, and the crowd followed.  When she got to the end of the garden, she\\r\\nturned round to see if Leonora had followed her, too; but was vexed to\\r\\nsee her still sitting on the steps with Louisa.  \"I\\'m sure I can do no\\r\\nmore than buy her another, CAN I!\" said she, again appealing to her\\r\\ncompanions.  \"No, to be sure,\" said they, eager to begin their play.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off, before\\r\\nCecilia could be satisfied with any!  Her thoughts were discomposed, and\\r\\nher mind was running upon something else.  No wonder, then, that she did\\r\\nnot play with her usual address.  She grew still more impatient.  She\\r\\nthrew down the ninepins.  \"Come, let us play at something else--at\\r\\nthreading the needle,\" said she, holding out her hand.  They all yielded\\r\\nto the hand which wore the bracelet.  But Cecilia, dissatisfied with\\r\\nherself, was discontented with everybody else.  Her tone grew more and\\r\\nmore peremptory.  One was too rude, another too stiff; one too slow,\\r\\nanother too quick; in short everything went wrong, and everybody was\\r\\ntired of her humours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe triumph of SUCCESS is absolute, but short.  Cecilia\\'s companions at\\r\\nlength recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip, and painted a\\r\\npeach, better than they, yet that they could play as well, and keep their\\r\\ntempers better; for she was discomposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking towards the house in a peevish mood, Cecilia met Leonora, but\\r\\npassed on.  \"Cecilia!\" cried Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what do you want with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we friends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know best,\" said Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are, if you will let me tell Louisa that you are sorry--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia, interrupting her, \"Oh, pray let me hear no more about Louisa!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not confess that you were in the wrong?  Oh, Cecilia! I had a\\r\\nbetter opinion of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your opinion is of no consequence to me now, for you don\\'t love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; not when you are unjust, Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unjust! I am not unjust; and if I were, you are not my governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but am not I your friend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t desire to have such a friend, who would quarrel with me for\\r\\nhappening to throw down little Louisa.  How could I tell that she had a\\r\\nmandarin in her hand? and when it was broken, could I do more than\\r\\npromise her another; was that unjust?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you know, Cecilia--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I KNOW,\" ironically.  \"I know, Leonora, that you love Louisa better than\\r\\nyou love me; that\\'s the injustice!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I did,\" replied Leonora, gravely, \"it would be no injustice, if she\\r\\ndeserved it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you compare Louisa to me!\" exclaimed Cecilia, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora made no answer; for she was really hurt at her friend\\'s conduct.\\r\\nShe walked on to join the rest of her companions.  They were dancing in a\\r\\nround upon the grass.  Leonora declined dancing; but they prevailed upon\\r\\nher to sing for them.  Her voice was not so sprightly, but it was sweeter\\r\\nthan usual.  Who sang so sweetly as Leonora? or who danced so nimbly as\\r\\nLouisa?  Away she was flying, all spirits and gaiety, when Leonora\\'s eyes\\r\\nfull of tears, caught hers.  Louisa silently let go her companion\\'s hand,\\r\\nand, quitting the dance, ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter\\r\\nwith her.  \"Nothing,\" replied she, \"that need interrupt you.  Go, my\\r\\ndear; go and dance again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa immediately ran away to her garden, and pulling off her little\\r\\nstraw hat, she lined it with the freshest strawberry-leaves, and was upon\\r\\nher knees before the strawberry-bed when Cecilia came by.  Cecilia was\\r\\nnot disposed to be pleased with Louisa at that instant, for two reasons;\\r\\nbecause she was jealous of her, and because she had injured her.  The\\r\\ninjury, however, Louisa had already forgotten.  Perhaps to tell things\\r\\njust as they were, she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as\\r\\nshe would have been before the fall of her mandarin; but this was the\\r\\nutmost extent of her malice, if it can be called malice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there, little one?\" said Cecilia, in a sharp tone.\\r\\n\"Are you eating your early strawberries here all alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Louisa, mysteriously, \"I am not eating them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing with them? can\\'t you answer, then?  I\\'m not playing\\r\\nwith you, child!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, as to that, Cecilia, you know I need not answer you unless I choose\\r\\nit; not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly, and if you\\r\\nwould not call me CHILD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should not I call you child?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because--because--I don\\'t know; but I wish you would stand out of my\\r\\nlight, Cecilia, for you are trampling upon all my strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not touched one, you covetous little creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed--indeed, Cecilia, I am not covetous.  I have not eaten one of\\r\\nthem; they are all for your friend Leonora.  See how unjust you are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unjust! that\\'s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora, as you\\r\\ncall her; but she is not my friend now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not your friend now!\" exclaimed Louisa; \"then I am sure you must have\\r\\ndone something VERY naughty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How?\" cried Cecilia, catching hold of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me go, let me go!\" cried Louisa, struggling.  \"I won\\'t give you one\\r\\nof my strawberries, for I don\\'t like you at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t, don\\'t you?\" cried Cecilia, provoked, and, catching the hat\\r\\nfrom Louisa, she flung the strawberries over the hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will nobody help me?\" exclaimed Louisa, snatching her hat again, and\\r\\nrunning away with all her force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have I done?\" said Cecilia, recollecting herself; \"Louisa! Louisa!\"\\r\\nshe called very loud, but Louisa would not turn back; she was running to\\r\\nher companions, who were still dancing, hand in hand, upon the grass,\\r\\nwhilst Leonora, sitting in the middle, was singing to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop! stop! and hear me!\" cried Louisa, breaking through them; and,\\r\\nrushing up to Leonora, she threw her hat at her feet, and panting for\\r\\nbreath--\"It was full--almost full of my own strawberries,\" said she, \"the\\r\\nfirst I ever got out of my garden.  They should all have been for you,\\r\\nLeonora; but now I have not one left.  They are all gone!\" said she; and\\r\\nshe hid her face in Leonora\\'s lap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gone! gone where?\" said everyone, at once running up to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia! Cecilia!\" said she, sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia,\" repeated Leonora, \"what of Cecilia?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was--it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come with me,\" said Leonora, unwilling to have her friend exposed.\\r\\n\"Come, and I will get you some more strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind the strawberries, indeed; but I wanted to have had the\\r\\npleasure of giving them to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora took her up in her arms to carry her away, but it was too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Cecilia! Cecilia, who won the prize!  It could not surely be\\r\\nCecilia,\" whispered every busy tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the bell summoned them in.  \"There she is!  There she\\r\\nis!\" cried they, pointing to an arbour, where Cecilia was standing\\r\\nashamed and alone; and, as they passed her, some lifted up their hands\\r\\nand eyes with astonishment, others whispered and huddled mysteriously\\r\\ntogether, as if to avoid her.  Leonora walked on, her head a little\\r\\nhigher than usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora!\" said Cecilia, timorously, as she passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Cecilia! who would have thought that you had a bad heart?\"  Cecilia\\r\\nturned her head aside and burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, indeed, she has not a bad heart!\" cried Louisa, running up to\\r\\nher and throwing her arms around her neck.  \"She\\'s very sorry; are not\\r\\nyou, Cecilia?  But don\\'t cry any more, for I forgive you, with all my\\r\\nheart--and I love you now, though I said I did not when I was in a\\r\\npassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you sweet-tempered girl! how I love you!\" said Cecilia, kissing her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, if you do, come along with me, and dry your eyes, for they\\r\\nare so red!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear, and I\\'ll come presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I will keep a place for you, next to me; but you must make haste,\\r\\nor you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper, and then\\r\\nyou will be so stared at!  So don\\'t stay, now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia followed Louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight.  \"And is\\r\\nLouisa,\" said she, to herself, \"the only one who would stop to pity me?\\r\\nMrs. Villars told me that this day should be mine.  She little thought\\r\\nhow it would end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, Cecilia threw herself down upon the ground; her arm\\r\\nleaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning, and\\r\\nwhich, in the pride and gaiety of her heart, she had called her throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Mrs. Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the\\r\\nevening, and, passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay, she started.\\r\\nCecilia rose hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" said Mrs. Villars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is I, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is _I_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, what keeps you here, my dear?  Where are your companions?  This is,\\r\\nperhaps, one of the happiest days of your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, madam,\" said Cecilia, hardly able to repress her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my dear, what is the matter?\"  Cecilia hesitated.  \"Speak, my dear.\\r\\nYou know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend, I never\\r\\npunish you as your governess; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me\\r\\nwhat is the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam, I am not afraid, but ashamed.  You asked me why I was not\\r\\nwith my companions.  Why, madam, because they have all left me, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I see that they all dislike me; and yet I don\\'t know why they\\r\\nshould, for I take as much pains to please as any of them.  All my\\r\\nmasters seem satisfied with me; and you yourself, madam, were pleased\\r\\nthis very morning to give me this bracelet; and I am sure you would not\\r\\nhave given it to anyone who did not deserve it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Villars.  \"You well deserve it for your\\r\\napplication--for your successful application.  The prize was for the most\\r\\nassiduous, not for the most amiable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, if it had been for the most amiable, it would not have been for\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Villars, smiling,--\"Why, what do you think yourself, Cecilia?  You\\r\\nare better able to judge than I am.  I can determine whether or no you\\r\\napply to what I give you to learn; whether you attend to what I desire\\r\\nyou to do, and avoid what I desire you not to do.  I know that I like you\\r\\nas a pupil, but I cannot know that I should like you as a companion,\\r\\nunless I were your companion.  Therefore I must judge of what I should\\r\\ndo, by seeing what others do in the same circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pray don\\'t, madam! for then you would not love me either.  And yet I\\r\\nthink you would love me; for I hope that I am as ready to oblige, and as\\r\\ngood-natured as--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Cecilia, I don\\'t doubt but that you would be very good natured to\\r\\nme; but I\\'m afraid that I should not like you unless you were good-\\r\\ntempered, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, madam, by good-natured I mean good-tempered--it\\'s all the same\\r\\nthing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I understand by them two very different things.  You are\\r\\ngood-natured, Cecilia; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your\\r\\ncompanions--to gain them praise, and save them from blame--to give them\\r\\npleasure, and relieve them from pain; but Leonora is good-tempered, for\\r\\nshe can bear with their foibles, and acknowledge her own.  Without\\r\\ndisputing about the right, she sometimes yields to those who are in the\\r\\nwrong.  In short, her temper is perfectly good; for it can bear and\\r\\nforbear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish that mine could!\" said Cecilia, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may,\" replied Mrs. Villars; \"but it is not wishes alone which can\\r\\nimprove us in anything.  Turn the same exertion and perseverance which\\r\\nhave won you the prize to-day to this object, and you will meet with the\\r\\nsame success; perhaps not on the first, the second, or the third attempt;\\r\\nbut depend upon it that you will at last.  Every new effort will weaken\\r\\nyour bad habits, and strengthen your good ones.  But you must not expect\\r\\nto succeed all at once.  I repeat it to you, for habit must be\\r\\ncounteracted by habit.  It would be as extravagant in us to expect that\\r\\nall our faults could be destroyed by one punishment, were it ever so\\r\\nsevere, as it was in the Roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago,\\r\\nto wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck, that he\\r\\nmight cut them off at one blow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mrs. Villars took Cecilia by the hand, and they began to walk home.\\r\\nSuch was the nature of Cecilia\\'s mind, that when any object was forcibly\\r\\nimpressed on her imagination, it caused a temporary suspension of her\\r\\nreasoning faculties.  Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits; and\\r\\nwhen fear did take possession of her mind, it was attended with total\\r\\ndebility.  Her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had\\r\\nbeen elated.  She walked on with Mrs. Villars in silence, until they came\\r\\nunder the shade of the elm-tree walk, and there, fixing her eyes upon\\r\\nMrs. Villars, she stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think, madam,\" said she, with hesitation--\"do you think, madam,\\r\\nthat I have a bad heart?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bad heart,--my dear! why, what put that into your head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora said that I had, madam, and I felt ashamed when she said so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad?\\r\\nHowever, in the first place, tell me what you mean by a bad heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not know what is meant by it, madam; but it is something\\r\\nwhich everybody hates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why do they hate it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because they think that it will hurt them, ma\\'am, I believe:  and that\\r\\nthose who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief; and that they\\r\\nnever do anybody any good but for their own ends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the best definition,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"which you can give me of\\r\\na bad heart is, that it is some constant propensity to hurt others, and\\r\\nto do wrong for the sake of doing wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam; but that is not all either.  There is still something else\\r\\nmeant; something which I cannot express--which, indeed, I never\\r\\ndistinctly understood; but of which, therefore, I was the more afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, to begin with what you do understand, tell me, Cecilia, do\\r\\nyou really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of\\r\\nwickedness?  No human being becomes wicked all at once.  A man begins by\\r\\ndoing wrong because it is, or because he thinks it, for his interest.  If\\r\\nhe continue to do so, he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his\\r\\nlove of virtue.  But how can you, Cecilia, who feel such a strong sense\\r\\nof shame, and such an eager desire to improve, imagine that you have a\\r\\nbad heart?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, madam, I never did, until everybody told me so, and then I began\\r\\nto be frightened about it.  This very evening, madam, when I was in a\\r\\npassion, I threw little Louisa\\'s strawberries away, which, I am sure, I\\r\\nwas very sorry for afterwards; and Leonora and everybody cried out that I\\r\\nhad a bad heart--but I am sure I was only in a passion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely.  And when you are in a passion, as you call it, Cecilia,\\r\\nyou see that you are tempted to do harm to others.  If they do not feel\\r\\nangry themselves, they do not sympathize with you.  They do not perceive\\r\\nthe motive which actuates you; and then they say that you have a bad\\r\\nheart.  I daresay, however, when your passion is over, and when you\\r\\nrecollect yourself, you are very sorry for what you have done and said;\\r\\nare not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, madam--very sorry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then make that sorry of use to you, Cecilia, and fix it steadily in your\\r\\nthoughts, as you hope to be good and happy, that if you suffer yourself\\r\\nto yield to your passion upon every occasion, anger and its consequences\\r\\nwill become familiar to your mind; and, in the same proportion, your\\r\\nsense of shame will be weakened, till what you began with doing from\\r\\nsudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice:  then you\\r\\nwould, indeed, according to our definition, have a bad heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, madam! I hope--I am sure I never shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, Cecilia; I do, indeed, believe that you never will; on the\\r\\ncontrary, I think that you have a very good disposition, and what is of\\r\\ninfinitely more consequence to you, an active desire of improvement.\\r\\nShow me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour, and I\\r\\nshall not despair of your becoming everything that I could wish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Cecilia\\'s countenance brightened, and she ran up the steps in almost\\r\\nas high spirits as she ran down them in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night to you, Cecilia,\" said Mrs. Villars, as she was crossing the\\r\\nhall.  \"Good-night to you, madam,\" said Cecilia; and she ran upstairs to\\r\\nbed.  She could not go to sleep; but she lay awake, reflecting upon the\\r\\nevents of the preceding day, and forming resolutions for the future, at\\r\\nthe same time that she had resolved, and resolved without effect, she\\r\\nwished to give her mind some more powerful motive.  Ambition she knew to\\r\\nbe its most powerful incentive.  \"Have I not,\" said she to herself,\\r\\n\"already won the prize of application, and cannot the same application\\r\\nprocure me a much higher prize?  Mrs. Villars said that if the prize had\\r\\nbeen promised to the most amiable, it would not have been given to me.\\r\\nPerhaps it would not yesterday, perhaps it might not to-morrow; but that\\r\\nis no reason that I should despair of ever deserving it.\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of this reasoning, Cecilia formed a design of proposing to\\r\\nher companions that they should give a prize, the first of the ensuing\\r\\nmonth (the lst of June), to the most amiable.  Mrs. Villars applauded the\\r\\nscheme, and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the prize,\" said they, \"be a bracelet of our own hair;\" and\\r\\ninstantly their shining scissors were produced, and each contributed a\\r\\nlock of their hair.  They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours,\\r\\nfrom the palest auburn to the brightest black.  Who was to have the\\r\\nhonour of plaiting them? was now the question.  Caroline begged that she\\r\\nmight, as she could plait very neatly, she said.  Cecilia, however, was\\r\\nequally sure that she could do it much better; and a dispute would have\\r\\ninevitably ensued, if Cecilia, recollecting herself just as her colour\\r\\nrose to scarlet, had not yielded--yielded, with no very good grace\\r\\nindeed, but as well as could be expected for the first time.  For it is\\r\\nhabit which confers ease; and without ease, even in moral actions, there\\r\\ncan be no grace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by Caroline, finished\\r\\nround the edge with silver twist, and on it was worked, in the smallest\\r\\nsilver letters, this motto, \"TO THE MOST AMIABLE.\"  The moment it was\\r\\ncompleted, everybody begged to try it on.  It fastened with little silver\\r\\nclasps, and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls, it was too\\r\\nlarge for the youngest.  Of this they bitterly complained, and\\r\\nunanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How foolish!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"don\\'t you perceive that if any of you\\r\\nwin it, you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from\\r\\nthe edge, but if we get it, we can\\'t make it larger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true,\" said they; \"but you need not to have called us foolish,\\r\\nCecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that Cecilia\\r\\noffended.  A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in\\r\\nthe effect.  Cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could\\r\\ngain by the greatest particular exertions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow far she succeeded in curing herself of this defect--how far she\\r\\nbecame deserving of the bracelet, and to whom the bracelet was given--\\r\\nshall be told in the History of the First of June.\\r\\n\\r\\n                               -----\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First of June was now arrived, and all the young competitors were in\\r\\na state of the most anxious suspense.  Leonora and Cecilia continued to\\r\\nbe the foremost candidates.  Their quarrel had never been finally\\r\\nadjusted, and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a\\r\\nreconciliation.  Cecilia, though she was capable of acknowledging any of\\r\\nher faults in public before all her companions, could not humble herself\\r\\nin private to Leonora.  Leonora was her equal; they were her inferiors,\\r\\nand submission is much easier to a vain mind, where it appears to be\\r\\nvoluntary, than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour.\\r\\nSo strongly did Cecilia feel this truth, that she even delayed making any\\r\\napology, or coming to any explanation with Leonora, until success should\\r\\nonce more give her the palm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I win the bracelet, to-day,\" said she to herself, \"I will solicit the\\r\\nreturn of Leonora\\'s friendship; it will be more valuable to me than even\\r\\nthe bracelet, and at such a time, and asked in such a manner, she surely\\r\\ncannot refuse it to me.\"  Animated with this hope of a double triumph,\\r\\nCecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity.  By constant attention\\r\\nand exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper, and\\r\\nchanged the course of her habits.  Her powers of pleasing were now\\r\\nexcited, instead of her abilities to excel; and, if her talents appeared\\r\\nless brilliant, her character was acknowledged to be more amiable.  So\\r\\ngreat an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our\\r\\nambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was now, if possible, more than ever desirous of doing what was\\r\\nright, but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong.  This\\r\\nwas the fundamental error of her mind; it arose in a great measure from\\r\\nher early education.  Her mother died when she was very young; and though\\r\\nher father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner, he had\\r\\ninsensibly infused into his daughter\\'s mind a portion of that\\r\\nenterprising, independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the\\r\\ncharacter of her brother.  This brother was some years older than\\r\\nCecilia, but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth.\\r\\nWhat her father\\'s precepts inculcated, his example enforced; and even\\r\\nCecilia\\'s virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a\\r\\nman than desirable in a female. All small objects and small errors she\\r\\nhad been taught to disregard as trifles; and her impatient disposition\\r\\nwas perpetually leading her into more material faults; yet her candour in\\r\\nconfessing these, she had been suffered to believe, was sufficient\\r\\nreparation and atonement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, on the contrary, who had been educated by her mother in a manner\\r\\nmore suited to her sex, had a character and virtues more peculiar to a\\r\\nfemale.  Her judgment had been early cultivated, and her good sense\\r\\nemployed in the regulation of her conduct.  She had been habituated to\\r\\nthat restraint, which, as a woman, she was to expect in life, and early\\r\\naccustomed to yield.  Compliance in her seemed natural and graceful; yet\\r\\nnotwithstanding the gentleness of her temper, she was in reality more\\r\\nindependent than Cecilia.  She had more reliance upon her own judgment,\\r\\nand more satisfaction in her own approbation.  The uniform kindness of\\r\\nher manner, the consistency and equality of her character, had fixed the\\r\\nesteem and passive love of her companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us\\r\\nunwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige, which is more a habit\\r\\nthan an emotion of the mind.  For Cecilia her companions felt active\\r\\nlove, for she was active in showing her love to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nActive love arises spontaneously in the mind, after feeling particular\\r\\ninstances of kindness, without reflection on the past conduct or general\\r\\ncharacter.  It exceeds the merits of its object, and is connected with a\\r\\nfeeling of generosity, rather than with a sense of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout determining which species of love is the most flattering to\\r\\nothers, we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our\\r\\nminds.  We give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being\\r\\njust; and we feel more self-complacency when we give our love\\r\\nvoluntarily, than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold.\\r\\nThough Cecilia\\'s companions might not know all this in theory, they\\r\\nproved it in practice; for they loved her in a much higher proportion to\\r\\nher merits than they loved Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or\\r\\na white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose.  Cecilia\\'s colour was\\r\\nred, Leonora\\'s white.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells; nothing talked of\\r\\nbut the long expected event of the evening.  Cecilia, following Leonora\\'s\\r\\nexample, had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual\\r\\nher vote, previously to their final determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both sitting together in Louisa\\'s room.  Louisa was recovering\\r\\nfrom the measles.  Everyone during her illness had been desirous of\\r\\nattending her; but Leonora and Cecilia were the only two that were\\r\\npermitted to see her, as they alone had had the distemper.  They were\\r\\nboth assiduous in their care of Louisa, but Leonora\\'s want of exertion to\\r\\novercome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of\\r\\npresence of mind, and prevented her from being so constantly useful as\\r\\nCecilia.  Cecilia, on the contrary, often made too much noise and bustle\\r\\nwith her officious assistance, and was too anxious to invent amusements\\r\\nand procure comforts for Louisa, without perceiving that illness takes\\r\\naway the power of enjoying them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was sitting at the window in the morning, exerting herself to\\r\\nentertain Louisa, she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to\\r\\ncome to the house.  Downstairs they ran immediately, to ask Mrs. Villars\\'\\r\\npermission to bring him into the hall.  Mrs. Villars consented, and away\\r\\nCecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions.  Then, first\\r\\nreturning into the hall, she found the peddler just unbuckling his box,\\r\\nand taking it off his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What would you be pleased to want, miss?\" said the peddler; \"I\\'ve all\\r\\nkinds of tweezer-cases, rings, and lockets of all sorts,\" continued he,\\r\\nopening all the glittering drawers successively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Cecilia, shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her\\r\\nmost, \"these are not the things which I want.  Have you any china\\r\\nfigures? any mandarins?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alack-a-day, miss, I had a great stock of that same chinaware; but now\\r\\nI\\'m quite out of them kind of things; but I believe,\" said he, rummaging\\r\\none of the deepest drawers, \"I believe I have one left, and here it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that is the very thing! what\\'s its price?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only three shillings, ma\\'am.\"  Cecilia paid the money, and was just\\r\\ngoing to carry off the mandarin, when the peddler took out of his great-\\r\\ncoat pocket a neat mahogany case.  It was about a foot long, and fastened\\r\\nat each end by two little clasps.  It had besides, a small lock in the\\r\\nmiddle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" said Cecilia, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only a china figure, miss, which I am going to carry to an elderly\\r\\nlady, who lives nigh hand, and who is mighty fond of such things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could you let me look at it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And welcome, miss,\" said he, and opened the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, goodness! how beautiful!\" exclaimed Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a figure of Flora, crowned with roses, and carrying a basket of\\r\\nflowers in her hand.  Cecilia contemplated it with delight.  \"How I\\r\\nshould like to give this to Louisa!\" said she to herself; and, at last,\\r\\nbreaking silence, \"Did you promise it to the old lady?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, miss, I didn\\'t promise it--she never saw it; and if so be that\\r\\nyou\\'d like to take it, I\\'d make no more words about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how much does it cost?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, miss, as to that, I\\'ll let you have it for half-a-guinea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure, and,\\r\\nemptying it upon the table, she began to count the shillings.  Alas!\\r\\nthere were but six shillings.  \"How provoking!\" said she; \"then I can\\'t\\r\\nhave it.  Where\\'s the mandarin?  Oh, I have it,\" said she, taking it up,\\r\\nand looking at it with the utmost disgust.  \"Is this the same that I had\\r\\nbefore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, miss, the very same,\" replied the peddler, who, during this time,\\r\\nhad been examining the little box out of which Cecilia had taken her\\r\\nmoney--it was of silver.  \"Why, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"since you\\'ve taken such\\r\\na fancy to the piece, if you\\'ve a mind to make up the remainder of the\\r\\nmoney, I will take this here little box, if you care to part with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia.  \"No,\" said Cecilia\\r\\nhastily, blushing a little, and stretching out her hand to receive it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, miss!\" said he, returning it carelessly, \"I hope there\\'s no offence.\\r\\nI meant but to serve you, that\\'s all.  Such a rare piece of china-work\\r\\nhas no cause to go a-begging,\" added he.  Then, putting the Flora\\r\\ndeliberately into the case, and turning the key with a jerk, he let it\\r\\ndrop into his pocket; when, lifting up his box by the leather straps, he\\r\\nwas preparing to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, stay one minute!\" said Cecilia, in whose mind there had passed a\\r\\nvery warm conflict during the peddler\\'s harangue.  \"Louisa would so like\\r\\nthis Flora,\" said she, arguing with herself.  \"Besides, it would be so\\r\\ngenerous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin; that\\r\\nwould be doing only common justice, for I promised it to her, and she\\r\\nexpects it.  Though, when I come to look at this mandarin, it is not even\\r\\nso good as hers was.  The gilding is all rubbed off, so that I absolutely\\r\\nmust buy this for her.  Oh, yes! I will, and she will be so delighted!\\r\\nand then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw, and\\r\\nthe broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Cecilia\\'s hand moved, and she was just going to decide:  \"Oh, but\\r\\nstop,\" said she to herself, \"consider--Leonora gave me this box, and it\\r\\nis a keepsake.  However, we have now quarrelled, and I dare say that she\\r\\nwould not mind my parting with it.  I\\'m sure that I should not care if\\r\\nshe was to give away my keepsake, the smelling-bottle, or the ring which\\r\\nI gave her.  Then what does it signify?  Besides, is it not my own? and\\r\\nhave I not a right to do what I please with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment, so critical for Cecilia, a party of her companions opened\\r\\nthe door.  She knew that they came as purchasers, and she dreaded her\\r\\nFlora\\'s becoming the prize of some higher bidder.  \"Here,\" said she,\\r\\nhastily putting the box into the peddler\\'s hand, without looking at it;\\r\\n\"take it, and give me the Flora.\"  Her hand trembled, though she snatched\\r\\nit impatiently.  She ran by, without seeming to mind any of her\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future\\r\\ngratification, or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity,\\r\\nremember that, unless they are totally depraved, they bear in their own\\r\\nhearts a monitor, who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions, to display her\\r\\npresent, in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self-\\r\\ncomplacency; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to\\r\\nhand, each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and\\r\\nthe generosity of the giver.  Cecilia was still displeased with herself,\\r\\nwith them, and even with their praise.  From Louisa\\'s gratitude, however,\\r\\nshe yet expected much pleasure, and immediately she ran upstairs to her\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin; she had\\r\\njust broken hers.  In giving her change, the peddler took out of his\\r\\npocket, with some halfpence, the very box which Cecilia had sold to him.\\r\\nLeonora did not in the least suspect the truth, for her mind was above\\r\\nsuspicion; and besides, she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to have that box,\" said she, \"for it is like one of which\\r\\nI was very fond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peddler named the price, and Leonora took the box.  She intended to\\r\\ngive it to little Louisa.  On going to her room she found her asleep, and\\r\\nshe sat softly down by her bedside.  Louisa opened her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope I didn\\'t disturb you,\" said Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no.  I didn\\'t hear you come in; but what have you got there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a little box; would you like to have it?  I bought on purpose for\\r\\nyou, as I thought perhaps it would please you, because it\\'s like that\\r\\nwhich I gave Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that out of which she used to give me Barbary drops.  I am very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you; I always thought that exceedingly pretty, and this,\\r\\nindeed, is as like it as possible.  I can\\'t unscrew it; will you try?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora unscrewed it.  \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Louisa, \"this must be\\r\\nCecilia\\'s box.  Look, don\\'t you see a great L at the bottom of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora\\'s colour changed.  \"Yes,\" she replied calmly, \"I see that; but it\\r\\nis no proof that it is Cecilia\\'s.  You know that I bought this box just\\r\\nnow of the peddler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That may be,\" said Louisa; \"but I remember scratching that L with my own\\r\\nneedle, and Cecilia scolded me for it, too.  Do go and ask her if she has\\r\\nlost her box--do,\" repeated Louisa, pulling her by the ruffle, as she did\\r\\nnot seem to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, indeed, did not hear, for she was lost in thought.  She was\\r\\ncomparing circumstances, which had before escaped her attention.  She\\r\\nrecollected that Cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall,\\r\\nwithout seeming to see her, but had blushed as she passed.  She\\r\\nremembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box, and\\r\\nwas going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence.  \"And why\\r\\nshould he keep it in his pocket, and not show it with his other things?\"\\r\\nCombining all these circumstances, Leonora had no longer any doubt of the\\r\\ntruth, for though she had honourable confidence in her friends, she had\\r\\ntoo much penetration to be implicitly credulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa,\" she began, but at this instant she heard a step, which, by its\\r\\nquickness, she knew to be Cecilia\\'s, coming along the passage.  \"If you\\r\\nlove me, Louisa,\" said Leonora, \"say nothing about the box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but why not?  I daresay she had lost it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I\\'m afraid she has not.\"  Louisa looked surprised.  \"But I\\r\\nhave reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, I won\\'t, indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia opened the door, came forward smiling, as if secure of a good\\r\\nreception, and taking the Flora out of the case, she placed it on the\\r\\nmantlepiece, opposite to Louisa\\'s bed.  \"Dear, how beautiful!\" cried\\r\\nLouisa, starting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Cecilia, \"and guess who it\\'s for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me, perhaps!\" said the ingenuous Louisa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, take it, and keep it, for my sake.  You know that I broke your\\r\\nmandarin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know it is; and I meant that it should be so.  I should only have\\r\\ndone what I was bound to do if I had only given you a mandarin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied Louisa, \"and that would have been enough, surely; but\\r\\nwhat a beautiful crown of roses! and then that basket of flowers! they\\r\\nalmost look as if I could smell them.  Dear Cecilia, I\\'m very much\\r\\nobliged to you; but I won\\'t take it by way of payment for the mandarin\\r\\nyou broke; for I\\'m sure you could not help that, and, besides, I should\\r\\nhave broken it myself by this time.  You shall give it to me entirely;\\r\\nand as your keepsake, I\\'ll keep it as long as I live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa stopped short and coloured; the word keepsake recalled the box to\\r\\nher mind, and all the train of ideas which the Flora had banished.\\r\\n\"But,\" said she, looking up wistfully in Cecilia\\'s face, and holding the\\r\\nFlora doubtfully, \"did you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, who was just quitting the room, turned her head back, and gave\\r\\nLouisa a look, which silenced her.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was so infatuated with her vanity, that she neither perceived\\r\\nLeonora\\'s sign nor Louisa\\'s confusion, but continued showing off her\\r\\npresent, by placing it in various situations, till at length she put it\\r\\ninto the case, and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the\\r\\nbed, \"I must go now, Louisa.  Good-bye,\" said she, running up and kissing\\r\\nher; \"but I\\'ll come again presently,\" then, clapping the door after her\\r\\nshe went.  But as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided, the\\r\\nsense of shame, which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many\\r\\nother sensations, rose uppermost in her mind.  \"What!\" said she to\\r\\nherself, \"is it possible that I have sold what I promised to keep for\\r\\never? and what Leonora gave me?  and I have concealed it too, and have\\r\\nbeen making a parade of my generosity.  Oh! what would Leonora, what\\r\\nwould Louisa--what would everybody think of me, if the truth were known?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHumiliated and grieved by these reflections, Cecilia began to search in\\r\\nher own mind for some consoling idea.  She began to compare her conduct\\r\\nwith that of others of her own age; and at length, fixing her comparison\\r\\nupon her brother George, as the companion of whom, from her infancy, she\\r\\nhad been habitually the most emulous, she recollected that an almost\\r\\nsimilar circumstance had once happened to him, and that he had not only\\r\\nescaped disgrace, but had acquired glory, by an intrepid confession of\\r\\nhis fault.  Her father\\'s word to her brother, on the occasion, she also\\r\\nperfectly recollected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come to me, George,\" he said holding out his hand, \"you are a generous,\\r\\nbrave boy:  they who dare to confess their faults will make great and\\r\\ngood men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were his words; but Cecilia, in repeating them to herself, forgot\\r\\nto lay that emphasis on the word MEN, which would have placed it in\\r\\ncontradistinction to the word WOMEN.  She willingly believed that the\\r\\nobservation extended equally to both sexes, and flattered herself that\\r\\nshe should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault, which she\\r\\nthought that it would be so much more difficult to confess.  \"Yes, but,\"\\r\\nsaid she, stopping herself, \"how can I confess it?  This very evening, in\\r\\na few hours, the prize will be decided.  Leonora or I shall win it.  I\\r\\nhave now as good a chance as Leonora, perhaps a better; and must I give\\r\\nup all my hopes--all that I have been labouring for this month past?  Oh,\\r\\nI never can!  If it were but to-morrow, or yesterday, or any day but\\r\\nthis, I would not hesitate; but now I am almost certain of the prize, and\\r\\nif I win it--well, why then I will--I think I will tell all--yes I will;\\r\\nI am determined,\" said Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a bell summoned them to dinner.  Leonora sat opposite to her, and\\r\\nshe was not a little surprised to see Cecilia look so gay and\\r\\nunconstrained.  \"Surely,\" said she to herself, \"if Cecilia had done that\\r\\nwhich I suspect, she would not, she could not, look as she does.\"  But\\r\\nLeonora little knew the cause of her gaiety.  Cecilia was never in higher\\r\\nspirits, or better pleased with herself, than when she had resolved upon\\r\\na sacrifice or a confession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must not this evening be given to the most amiable?  Whose, then, will\\r\\nit be?\"  All eyes glanced first at Cecilia, and then at Leonora.  Cecilia\\r\\nsmiled; Leonora blushed.  \"I see that it is not yet decided,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nVillars; and immediately they ran upstairs, amidst confused whisperings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia\\'s voice could be distinguished far above the rest.  \"How can she\\r\\nbe so happy!\" said Leonora to herself.  \"Oh Cecilia, there was a time\\r\\nwhen you could not have neglected me so! when we were always together the\\r\\nbest of friends and companions; our wishes, tastes, and pleasures the\\r\\nsame!  Surely she did once love me,\" said Leonora; \"but now she is quite\\r\\nchanged.  She has even sold my keepsake; and she would rather win a\\r\\nbracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much\\r\\nsuperior to Leonora, than have my esteem, my confidence, and my\\r\\nfriendship for her whole life--yes, for her whole life, for I am sure she\\r\\nwill be an amiable woman.  Oh, that this bracelet had never been thought\\r\\nof, or that I were certain of her winning it; for I am sure that I do not\\r\\nwish to win it from her.  I would rather--a thousand times rather--that\\r\\nwe were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world.  And how\\r\\npleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please!--how candid she is!--\\r\\nhow much she can improve herself!  Let me be just, though she has\\r\\noffended me; she is wonderfully improved within this last month.  For one\\r\\nfault, and THAT against myself, shall I forget all her merits?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Leonora said these last words, she could but just hear the voices of\\r\\nher companions.  They had left her alone in the gallery.  She knocked\\r\\nsoftly at Louisa\\'s door.  \"Come in,\" said Louisa; \"I\\'m not asleep.  Oh,\"\\r\\nsaid she, starting up with the Flora in her hand, the instant that the\\r\\ndoor was opened; \"I\\'m so glad you are come, Leonora, for I did so long to\\r\\nhear what you all were making such a noise about.  Have you forgot that\\r\\nthe bracelet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! is this the evening?\" inquired Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, here\\'s my white shell for you,\" said Louisa.  \"I\\'ve kept it in my\\r\\npocket this fortnight; and though Cecilia did give me this Flora, I still\\r\\nlove you a great deal better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you, Louisa,\" said Leonora, gratefully.  \"I will take your\\r\\nshell, and I shall value it as long as I live; but here is a red one, and\\r\\nif you wish to show me that you love me, you will give this to Cecilia.\\r\\nI know that she is particularly anxious for your preference, and I am\\r\\nsure that she deserves it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if I could I would choose both of you,\" said Louisa, \"but you know\\r\\nI can only choose which I like the best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean, my dear Louisa,\" said Leonora, \"that you like me the best,\\r\\nI am very much obliged to you, for, indeed, I wish you to love me; but it\\r\\nis enough for me to know it in private.  I should not feel the least more\\r\\npleasure at hearing it in public, or in having it made known to all my\\r\\ncompanions, especially at a time when it would give poor Cecilia a great\\r\\ndeal of pain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should it give her pain?\" asked Louisa; \"I don\\'t like her for\\r\\nbeing jealous of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Louisa, surely you don\\'t think Cecilia jealous?  She only tries to\\r\\nexcel, and to please; she is more anxious to succeed than I am, it is\\r\\ntrue, because she has a great deal more activity, and perhaps more\\r\\nambition.  And it would really mortify her to lose this prize--you know\\r\\nthat she proposed it herself.  It has been her object for this month\\r\\npast, and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, dear Leonora, why should you lose it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, my dear, it would be no loss to me; and, if it were, I would\\r\\nwillingly suffer it for Cecilia; for, though we seem not to be such good\\r\\nfriends as we used to be, I love her very much, and she will love me\\r\\nagain--I\\'m sure she will; when she no longer fears me as a rival, she\\r\\nwill again love me as a friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery.\\r\\nThey all knocked hastily at the door, calling \"Leonora! Leonora! will you\\r\\nnever come?  Cecilia has been with us this half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora smiled.  \"Well, Louisa,\" said she, smiling, \"will you promise\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am sure, by the way they speak to you, that they won\\'t give you\\r\\nthe prize!\" said the little Louisa, and the tears started into her eyes.\\r\\n\"They love me, though, for all that,\" said Leonora; \"and as for the\\r\\nprize, you know whom I wish to have it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora! Leonora!\" called her impatient companions; \"don\\'t you hear us?\\r\\nWhat are you about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, she never will take any trouble about anything,\" said one of the\\r\\nparty; \"let\\'s go away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, go, go! make haste!\" cried Louisa; \"don\\'t stay; they are so angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, then, that you have promised me,\" said Leonora, and she left\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this time, Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions.\\r\\nThe ambition which she had felt to win the first prize--the prize of\\r\\nsuperior talents and superior application--was not to be compared to the\\r\\nabsolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of\\r\\nthe love and approbation of her equals and rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo employ her exuberant activity, Cecilia had been dragging branches of\\r\\nlilacs and laburnums, roses and sweet briar, to ornament the bower in\\r\\nwhich her fate was to be decided.  It was excessively hot, but her mind\\r\\nwas engaged, and she was indefatigable.  She stood still at last to\\r\\nadmire her works.  Her companions all joined in loud applause.  They were\\r\\nnot a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she\\r\\nexpressed to win their prize, and by the great importance which she\\r\\nseemed to affix to the preference of each individual.  At last, \"Where is\\r\\nLeonora?\" cried one of them; and immediately, as we have seen, they ran\\r\\nto call her.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was left alone.  Overcome with heat and too violent exertion, she\\r\\nhad hardly strength to support herself; each moment appeared to her\\r\\nintolerably long.  She was in a state of the utmost suspense, and all her\\r\\ncourage failed her.  Even hope forsook her; and hope is a cordial which\\r\\nleaves the mind depressed and enfeebled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The time is now come,\" said Cecilia; \"in a few moments all will be\\r\\ndecided.  In a few moments--goodness!  How much do I hazard?  If I should\\r\\nnot win the prize, how shall I confess what I have done?  How shall I beg\\r\\nLeonora to forgive me?  I, who hoped to restore my friendship to her as\\r\\nan honour!  They are gone to seek for her.  The moment she appears I\\r\\nshall be forgotten.  What--what shall I do?\" said Cecilia, covering her\\r\\nface with her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was Cecilia\\'s situation when Leonora, accompanied by her companions,\\r\\nopened the hall door.  They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia.  As\\r\\nLeonora came into the bower, she held out her hand to Cecilia.  \"We are\\r\\nnot rivals, but friends, I hope,\" said she.  Cecilia clasped her hand;\\r\\nbut she was in too great agitation to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was now set in the arbour--the vase was now placed in the\\r\\nmiddle.  \"Well!\" said Cecilia, eagerly, \"who begins?\"  Caroline, one of\\r\\nher friends, came forward first, and then all the others successively.\\r\\nCecilia\\'s emotion was hardly conceivable.  \"Now they are all in!  Count\\r\\nthem, Caroline!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One, two, three, four; the numbers are both equal.\"  There was a dead\\r\\nsilence.  \"No, they are not,\" exclaimed Cecilia, pressing forward, and\\r\\nputting a shell into a vase.  \"I have not given mine, and I give it to\\r\\nLeonora.\"  Then, snatching the bracelet, \"It is yours, Leonora,\" said\\r\\nshe; \"take it, and give me back your friendship.\"  The whole assembly\\r\\ngave one universal clap and a general shout of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be surprised at this from you, Cecilia,\" said Leonora; \"and do\\r\\nyou then still love me as you used to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Leonora, stop! don\\'t praise me; I don\\'t deserve this,\" said she,\\r\\nturning to her loudly applauding companions.  \"You will soon despise me.\\r\\nOh, Leonora, you will never forgive me!  I have deceived you; I have\\r\\nsold--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Mrs. Villars appeared.  The crowd divided.  She had\\r\\nheard all that passed, from her window.  \"I applaud your generosity,\\r\\nCecilia,\" said she, \"but I am to tell you that, in this instance it is\\r\\nunsuccessful.  You have not it in your power to give the prize to\\r\\nLeonora.  It is yours.  I have another vote to give to you.  You have\\r\\nforgotten Louisa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"but surely, ma\\'am, Louisa loves Leonora\\r\\nbetter than she does me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She commissioned me, however,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"to give you a red\\r\\nshell; and you will find it in this box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia started, and turned as pale as death; it was the fatal box!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Villars produced another box.  She opened it; it contained the\\r\\nFlora.  \"And Louisa also desired me,\" said she, \"to return to you this\\r\\nFlora.\"  She put it into Cecilia\\'s hand.  Cecilia trembled so that she\\r\\ncould not hold it.  Leonora caught it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, madam!  Oh, Leonora!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"now I have no hope left.\\r\\nI intended--I was just going to tell--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Cecilia,\" said Leonora, \"you need not tell it me; I know it\\r\\nalready; and I forgive you with all my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I can prove to you,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"that Leonora has forgiven\\r\\nyou.  It is she who has given you the prize; it was she who persuaded\\r\\nLouisa to give you her vote.  I went to see her a little while ago; and\\r\\nperceiving, by her countenance, that something was the matter, I pressed\\r\\nher to tell me what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, madam,\\' said she, \\'Leonora has made me promise to give my shell to\\r\\nCecilia.  Now I don\\'t love Cecilia half so well as I do Leonora.\\r\\nBesides, I would not have Cecilia think I vote for her because she gave\\r\\nme a Flora.\\'  Whilst Louisa was speaking,\" continued Mrs. Villars, \"I saw\\r\\nthis silver box lying on the bed.  I took it up, and asked if it was not\\r\\nyours, and how she came by it.  \\'Indeed, madam,\\' said Louisa, \\'I could\\r\\nhave been almost certain that it was Cecilia\\'s; but Leonora gave it me,\\r\\nand she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning.  If anybody\\r\\nelse had told me so, I could not have believed them, because I remember\\r\\nthe box so well; but I can\\'t help believing Leonora.\\'  But did not you\\r\\nask Cecilia about it? said I.  \\'No, madam,\\' replied Louisa; \\'for Leonora\\r\\nforbade me.  I guessed her reason.\\'  Well, said I, give me the box, and I\\r\\nwill carry your shell in it to Cecilia.  \\'Then, madam,\\' said she, \\'if I\\r\\nmust give it her, pray do take the Flora, and return it to her first,\\r\\nthat she may not think it is for that I do it.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, generous Louisa!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"but, indeed, Leonora, I cannot\\r\\ntake your shell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, dear Cecilia, accept of mine instead of it! you cannot refuse it;\\r\\nI only follow your example.  As for the bracelet,\" added Leonora, taking\\r\\nCecilia\\'s hand, \"I assure you I don\\'t wish for it, and you do, and you\\r\\ndeserve it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Cecilia, \"indeed, I do not deserve it.  Next to you, surely\\r\\nLouisa deserves it best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa! oh, yes, Louisa,\" exclaimed everybody with one voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her; she\\r\\ndeserves that reward.  For one fault I cannot forget all your merits,\\r\\nCecilia, nor, I am sure, will your companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, surely, not your best friend,\" said Leonora, kissing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody present was moved.  They looked up to Leonora with respectful\\r\\nand affectionate admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Leonora, how I love you! and how I wish to be like you!\" exclaimed\\r\\nCecilia--\"to be as good, as generous!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather wish, Cecilia,\" interrupted Mrs. Villars, \"to be as just; to be\\r\\nas strictly honourable, and as invariably consistent.  Remember, that\\r\\nmany of our sex are capable of great efforts--of making what they call\\r\\ngreat sacrifices to virtue or to friendship; but few treat their friends\\r\\nwith habitual gentleness, or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence\\r\\nand good sense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE MERCHANTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Chi di gallina nasce, convien che rozole.\\r\\n     As the old cock crows, so crows the young.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have visited Italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful\\r\\nindustry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of Naples.\\r\\nTheir manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly\\r\\ndescribed in the following \"Extract from a Traveller\\'s Journal.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Varieties of Literature, vol. i. p. 299.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The children are busied in various ways.  A great number of them bring\\r\\nfish for sale to town from Santa Lucia; others are very often seen about\\r\\nthe arsenals, or wherever carpenters are at work, employed in gathering\\r\\nup the chips and pieces of wood; or by the sea-side, picking up sticks,\\r\\nand whatever else has drifted ashore, which, when their basket is full,\\r\\nthey carry away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children of two or three years old, who can scarcely crawl along upon\\r\\nthe ground, in company with boys of five or six, are employed in this\\r\\npretty trade.  Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of\\r\\nthe city, where in several places they form a sort of little market,\\r\\nsitting round with their stock of wood before them.  Labourers, and the\\r\\nlower order of citizens, buy it of them to burn in the tripods for\\r\\nwarming themselves, or to use in their scanty kitchens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells,\\r\\nwhich, particularly in the spring season, is drunk in great abundance.\\r\\nOthers again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of\\r\\nfruit, of pressed honey, cakes, and comfits, and then, like little\\r\\npeddlers, offer and sell them to other children, always for no more\\r\\nprofit than that they may have their share of them free of expense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is really curious to see how an urchin, whose whole stock and\\r\\nproperty consist in a board and a knife, will carry about a water-melon,\\r\\nor a half roasted gourd, collect a troup of children round him, set down\\r\\nhis board, and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their\\r\\nlittle piece of copper; and the Lilliputian tradesmen act with no less\\r\\ncaution as the exigencies of the case may require, to prevent his being\\r\\ncheated out of a morsel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advantages of truth and honesty, and the value of a character for\\r\\nintegrity, are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their\\r\\ndaily intercourse with each other.  The fair dealer is always sooner or\\r\\nlater seen to prosper.  The most cunning cheat is at last detected and\\r\\ndisgraced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked\\r\\nby many Neapolitan children, especially by those who were acquainted with\\r\\nthe characters and history of Piedro and Francisco, two boys originally\\r\\nequal in birth, fortune and capacity, but different in their education,\\r\\nand consequently in their habits and conduct.  Francisco was the son of\\r\\nan honest gardener, who, from the time he could speak, taught him to love\\r\\nto speak the truth, showed him that liars are never believed--that cheats\\r\\nand thieves cannot be trusted, and that the shortest way to obtain a good\\r\\ncharacter is to deserve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth and white paper, as the proverb says, take all impressions.  The\\r\\nboy profited much by his father\\'s precepts, and more by his example; he\\r\\nalways heard his father speak the truth, and saw that he dealt fairly\\r\\nwith everybody.  In all his childish traffic, Francisco, imitating his\\r\\nparents, was scrupulously honest, and therefore all his companions\\r\\ntrusted him--\"As honest as Francisco,\" became a sort of proverb amongst\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As honest as Francisco,\" repeated Piedro\\'s father, when he one day heard\\r\\nthis saying.  \"Let them say so; I say, \\'As sharp as Piedro\\'; and let us\\r\\nsee which will go through the world best.\"  With the idea of making his\\r\\nson SHARP he made him cunning.  He taught him, that to make a GOOD\\r\\nBARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to\\r\\ndispose of; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking\\r\\nadvantage of their ignorance or of their confidence.  He often repeated\\r\\nhis favourite proverb--\"The buyer has need of a hundred eyes; the seller\\r\\nhas need but of one.\" *  And he took frequent opportunities of explaining\\r\\nthe meaning of this maxim to his son.  He was a fisherman; and as his\\r\\ngains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence, he trusted\\r\\nhabitually to his good luck.  After being idle for a whole day, he would\\r\\ncast his line or his nets, and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine\\r\\nfish, he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chi compra ha bisogna di cent\\' occhi; chi vende n\\'ha assai di uno.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread,\" he would\\r\\nsay.  \"Look here; I work but five minutes, and I have not only daily\\r\\nbread, but daily fish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon these occasions, our fisherman always forgot, or neglected to count,\\r\\nthe hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to\\r\\nsea, or angling in vain on the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Piedro, who used to bask in the sun upon the sea-shore beside his\\r\\nfather, and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing-boat, acquired\\r\\nhabits of idleness, which seemed to his father of little consequence\\r\\nwhilst he was BUT A CHILD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will you do with Piedro as he grows up, neighbour?\" said the\\r\\ngardener.  \"He is smart and quick enough, but he is always in mischief.\\r\\nScarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him\\r\\namongst my grapes.  I track his footsteps all over my vineyard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HE IS BUT A CHILD yet, and knows no better,\" replied the fisherman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you don\\'t teach him better now he is a child, how will he know\\r\\nwhen he is a man?\" said the gardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes, truly!\" cried the fisherman:  \"a\\r\\nfew grapes more or less in your vineyard, what does it signify?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I speak for your son\\'s sake, and not for the sake of my grapes,\" said\\r\\nthe gardener; \"and I tell you again, the boy will not do well in the\\r\\nworld, neighbour, if you don\\'t look after him in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do well enough in the world, you will find,\" answered the\\r\\nfisherman, carelessly.  \"Whenever he casts my nets, they never come up\\r\\nempty.  \\'It is better to be lucky than wise.\\'\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* E meglio esser fortunato che savio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his father, and\\r\\nto which he most willingly trusted, because it gave him less trouble to\\r\\nfancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come here, child,\" said his father to him, when he returned home after\\r\\nthe preceding conversation with the gardener; \"how old are you, my boy?--\\r\\ntwelve years old, is not it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As old as Francisco, and older by six months,\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And smarter and more knowing by six years,\" said his father.  \"Here,\\r\\ntake these fish to Naples, and let us see how you\\'ll sell them for me.\\r\\nVenture a small fish, as the proverb says, to catch a great one. *  I was\\r\\ntoo late with them at the market yesterday, but nobody will know but what\\r\\nthey are just fresh out of the water, unless you go and tell them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* Butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I; trust me for that; I\\'m not such a fool,\" replied Piedro,\\r\\nlaughing; \"I leave that to Francisco.  Do you know, I saw him the other\\r\\nday miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to\\r\\nthe customer, who was just laying down the money for it, and who was a\\r\\nraw servant-boy, moreover--one who would never have guessed there were\\r\\ntwo sides to a melon, if he had not, as you say, father, been told of\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you to market.  You are a droll chap,\" said his father, \"and\\r\\nwill sell my fish cleverly, I\\'ll be bound.  As to the rest, let every man\\r\\ntake care of his own grapes.  You understand me, Piedro?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly,\" said the boy, who perceived that his father was indifferent\\r\\nas to his honesty, provided he sold fish at the highest price possible.\\r\\nHe proceeded to the market, and he offered his fish with assiduity to\\r\\nevery person whom he thought likely to buy it, especially to those upon\\r\\nwhom he thought he could impose.  He positively asserted to all who\\r\\nlooked at his fish, that they were just fresh out of the water.  Good\\r\\njudges of men and fish knew that he said what was false, and passed him\\r\\nby with neglect; but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with\\r\\nthe very same young raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruised\\r\\nmelon from Francisco.  He made up to him directly, crying, \"Fish!  Fine\\r\\nfresh fish! fresh fish!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it caught to-day?\" said the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, this morning; not an hour ago,\" said Piedro, with the greatest\\r\\neffrontery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant-boy was imposed upon; and being a foreigner, speaking the\\r\\nItalian language but imperfectly, and not being expert at reckoning the\\r\\nItalian money, he was no match for the cunning Piedro, who cheated him\\r\\nnot only as to the freshness, but as to the price of the commodity.\\r\\nPiedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to\\r\\nhave done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina, where\\r\\nhis father lived, he overtook Francisco, who was leading his father\\'s\\r\\nass.  The ass was laden with large panniers, which were filled with the\\r\\nstalks and leaves of cauliflowers, cabbages, broccoli, lettuces, etc.--\\r\\nall the refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens, which are usually collected by\\r\\nthe gardeners\\' boys, and carried to the gardens round Naples, to be mixed\\r\\nwith other manure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well filled panniers, truly,\" said Piedro, as he overtook Francisco and\\r\\nthe ass.  The panniers were indeed not only filled to the top, but piled\\r\\nup with much skill and care, so that the load met over the animal\\'s back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not a very heavy load for the ass, though it looks so large,\" said\\r\\nFrancisco.  \"The poor fellow, however, shall have a little of this\\r\\nwater,\" added he, leading the ass to a pool by the roadside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not thinking of the ass, boy; I was not thinking of any ass, but\\r\\nof you, when I said, \\'Well filled panniers, truly!\\'  This is your\\r\\nmorning\\'s work, I presume, and you\\'ll make another journey to Naples to-\\r\\nday, on the same errand, I warrant, before your father thinks you have\\r\\ndone enough?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough, but before I think so\\r\\nmyself,\" replied Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do enough to satisfy myself and my father, too,\" said Piedro, \"without\\r\\nslaving myself after your fashion.  Look here,\" producing the money he\\r\\nhad received for the fish; \"all this was had for asking.  It is no bad\\r\\nthing, you\\'ll allow, to know how to ask for money properly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be ashamed to beg, or borrow either,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither did I get what you see by begging, or borrowing either,\" said\\r\\nPiedro, \"but by using my wits; not as you did yesterday, when, like a\\r\\nnovice, you showed the bruised side of your melon, and so spoiled your\\r\\nmarket by your wisdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wisdom I think it still,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your father?\" asked Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my father,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine is of a different way of thinking,\" said Piedro.  \"He always tells\\r\\nme that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes, and if one can blind the\\r\\nwhole hundred, so much the better.  You must know, I got off the fish to-\\r\\nday that my father could not sell yesterday in the market--got it off for\\r\\nfresh just out of the river--got twice as much as the market price for\\r\\nit; and from whom, think you?  Why, from the very booby that would have\\r\\nbought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him.\\r\\nYou\\'ll allow I\\'m no fool, Francisco, and that I\\'m in a fair way to grow\\r\\nrich, if I go on as I have begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" said Francisco; \"you forgot that the booby you took in to-day\\r\\nwill not be so easily taken in to-morrow.  He will buy no more fish from\\r\\nyou, because he will be afraid of your cheating him; but he will be ready\\r\\nenough to buy fruit from me, because he will know I shall not cheat him--\\r\\nso you\\'ll have lost a customer, and I gained one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart,\" said Piedro.  \"One customer does not make a market;\\r\\nif he buys no more from me, what care I? there are people enough to buy\\r\\nfish in Naples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner?\" asked Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they will be only so good as to give me leave,\" said Piedro,\\r\\nlaughing, and repeating his father\\'s proverb, \"\\'Venture a small fish to\\r\\ncatch a large one.\\'\" *  He had learned to think that to cheat in making\\r\\nbargains was witty and clever.\\r\\n\\r\\n* see anted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have never considered, then,\" said Francisco, \"that all these\\r\\npeople will, one after another, find you out in time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, in time; but it will be some time first.  There are a great many of\\r\\nthem, enough to last me all the summer, if I lose a customer a day,\" said\\r\\nPiedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And next summer,\" observed Francisco, \"what will you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next summer is not come yet; there is time enough to think what I shall\\r\\ndo before next summer comes.  Why, now, suppose the blockheads, after\\r\\nthey had been taken in and found it out, all joined against me, and would\\r\\nbuy none of our fish--what then?  Are there no trades but that of a\\r\\nfisherman?  In Naples, are there not a hundred ways of making money for a\\r\\nsmart lad like me? as my father says.  What do you think of turning\\r\\nmerchant, and selling sugar-plums and cakes to the children in their\\r\\nmarket?  Would they be hard to deal with, think you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think not,\" said Francisco; \"but I think the children would find out\\r\\nin time if they were cheated, and would like it as little as the men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t doubt them.  Then IN TIME I could, you know, change my trade--\\r\\nsell chips and sticks in the wood-market--hand about the lemonade to the\\r\\nfine folks, or twenty other things.  There are trades enough, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, for the honest dealer,\" said Francisco, \"but for no other; for in\\r\\nall of them you\\'ll find, as MY father says, that a good character is the\\r\\nbest fortune to set up with.  Change your trade ever so often, you\\'ll be\\r\\nfound out for what you are at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I, pray?\" said Piedro, angrily.  \"The whole truth of the\\r\\nmatter is, Francisco, that you envy my good luck, and can\\'t bear to hear\\r\\nthis money jingle in my hand.  Ay, stroke the long ears of your ass, and\\r\\nlook as wise as you please.  It\\'s better to be lucky than wise, as MY\\r\\nfather says.  Good morning to you.  When I am found out for what I am, or\\r\\nwhen the worst comes to the worst, I can drive a stupid ass, with his\\r\\npanniers filled with rubbish, as well as you do now, HONEST FRANCISCO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite so well.  Unless you were HONEST FRANCISCO, you would not fill\\r\\nhis panniers quite so readily.\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was certain, that Francisco was so well known for his honesty\\r\\namongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was acquainted,\\r\\nthat everyone was glad to deal with him; and as he never wronged anyone,\\r\\nall were willing to serve him--at least, as much as they could without\\r\\nloss to themselves:  so that after the market was over, his panniers were\\r\\nregularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted.\\r\\nHis industry was constant, his gains small but certain, and he every day\\r\\nhad more and more reason to trust to his father\\'s maxim--That honesty is\\r\\nthe best policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreign servant lad, to whom Francisco had so honestly, or, as Piedro\\r\\nsaid, so sillily, shown the bruised side of the melon, was an Englishman.\\r\\nHe left his native country, of which he was extremely fond, to attend\\r\\nupon his master, to whom he was still more attached.  His master was in a\\r\\ndeclining state of health, and this young lad waited on him a little more\\r\\nto his mind than his other servants.  We must, in consideration of his\\r\\nzeal, fidelity and inexperience, pardon him for not being a good judge of\\r\\nfish.  Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once, he had\\r\\ntoo much sense to be twice made a dupe.  The next time he met Piedro in\\r\\nthe market, he happened to be in company with several English gentlemen\\'s\\r\\nservants, and he pointed Piedro out to them all as an arrant knave.  They\\r\\nheard his cry of \"Fresh fish! fresh fish! fine fresh fish!\" with\\r\\nincredulous smiles, and let him pass, but not without some expressions of\\r\\ncontempt, though uttered in English, he tolerably well understood; for\\r\\nthe tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages.  He\\r\\nlost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the\\r\\nday before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY.  The market was well supplied,\\r\\nand he could not get rid of his cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not this truly provoking?\" said Piedro, as he passed by Francisco,\\r\\nwho was selling fruit for his father.  \"Look, my basket is as heavy as\\r\\nwhen I left home and look at \\'em yourself, they really are fine fresh\\r\\nfish to-day and yet, because that revengeful booby told how I took him in\\r\\nyesterday, not one of yonder crowd would buy them; and all the time they\\r\\nreally are fresh to-day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So they are,\" said Franscisco, \"but you said so yesterday, when they\\r\\nwere not; and he that was duped then, is not ready to believe you to-day.\\r\\nHow does he know that you deserve it better?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might have looked at the fish,\" repeated Piedro; \"they are fresh to-\\r\\nday.  I am sure he need not have been afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" said Francisco; \"but as my father said to you once--the scalded dog\\r\\nfears cold water.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Il cane scottato dell\\' acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere their conversation was interrupted by the same English lad, who\\r\\nsmiled as he came up to Francisco, and taking up a fine pine-apple, he\\r\\nsaid, in a mixture of bad Italian and English--\"I need not look at the\\r\\nother side of this; you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks.\\r\\nName your price; I know you have but one, and that an honest one; and as\\r\\nto the rest, I am able and willing to pay for what I buy; that is to say,\\r\\nmy master is, which comes to the same thing.  I wish your fruit could\\r\\nmake him well, and it would be worth its weight in gold to me, at least.\\r\\nWe must have some of your grapes for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he not well?\" inquired Francisco.  \"We must, then, pick out the best\\r\\nfor him,\" at the same time singling out a tempting bunch.  \"I hope he\\r\\nwill like these; but if you could some day come as far as Resina (it is a\\r\\nvillage but a few miles out of town, where we have our vineyard), you\\r\\ncould there choose for yourself, and pluck them fresh from the vines for\\r\\nyour poor master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless you, my good boy; I should take you for an Englishman, by your way\\r\\nof dealing.  I\\'ll come to your village.  Only write me down the name; for\\r\\nyour Italian names slip through my head.  I\\'ll come to the vineyard if it\\r\\nwas ten miles off; and all the time we stay in Naples (may it not be so\\r\\nlong as I fear it will!), with my master\\'s leave, which he never refuses\\r\\nme to anything that\\'s proper, I\\'ll deal with you for all our fruit, as\\r\\nsure as my name\\'s Arthur, and with none else, with my good will.  I wish\\r\\nall your countrymen would take after you in honesty, indeed I do,\"\\r\\nconcluded the Englishman, looking full at Piedro, who took up his unsold\\r\\nbasket of fish, looking somewhat silly, and gloomily walked off.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur, the English servant, was as good as his word.  He dealt\\r\\nconstantly with Francisco, and proved an excellent customer, buying from\\r\\nhim during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted.  His\\r\\nmaster, who was an Englishman of distinction, was invited to take up his\\r\\nresidence, during his stay in Italy, at the Count de F.\\'s villa, which\\r\\nwas in the environs of Naples--an easy walk from Resina.  Francisco had\\r\\nthe pleasure of seeing his father\\'s vineyard often full of generous\\r\\nvisitors, and Arthur, who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised\\r\\nmelon, was, he said, \"proud to think that some of this was his doing, and\\r\\nthat an Englishman never forgot a good turn, be it from a countryman or\\r\\nforeigner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Francisco\\'s father to him, whilst Arthur was in the\\r\\nvineyard helping to tend the vines, \"I am to thank you and your honesty,\\r\\nit seems, for our having our hands so full of business this season.  It\\r\\nis fair you should have a share of our profits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I have, father, enough and enough, when I see you and mother going on\\r\\nso well.  What can I want more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my brave boy, we know you are a grateful, good son; but I have been\\r\\nyour age myself; you have companions, you have little expenses of your\\r\\nown.  Here; this vine, this fig-tree, and a melon a week next summer\\r\\nshall be yours.  With these make a fine figure amongst the little\\r\\nNeapolitan merchants; and all I wish is that you may prosper as well, and\\r\\nby the same honest means, in managing for yourself, as you have done\\r\\nmanaging for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, father; and if I prosper at all, it shall be by those means,\\r\\nand no other, or I should not be worthy to be called your son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer\\'s work as\\r\\ndid Francisco the honest.  No extraordinary events happened, no singular\\r\\ninstance of bad or good luck occurred; but he felt, as persons usually\\r\\ndo, the natural consequences of his own actions.  He pursued his scheme\\r\\nof imposing, as far as he could, upon every person he dealt with; and the\\r\\nconsequence was, that at last nobody would deal with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is easy to outwit one person, but impossible to outwit all the\\r\\nworld,\" said a man * who knew the world at least as well as either Piedro\\r\\nor his father.\\r\\n\\r\\n* The Duke de Rochefoucault.--\"On peut etre puls fin qu\\'un autre, mais\\r\\npas plus fin que tous les autres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s father, amongst others, had reason to complain.  He saw his own\\r\\ncustomers fall off from him, and was told, whenever he went into the\\r\\nmarket, that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him.  One\\r\\nday, when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour, in\\r\\nconsequence of these reproaches, and of his not having found customers\\r\\nfor his goods, he espied his SMART son Piedro at a little merchant\\'s\\r\\nfruit-board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness.  \"Where,\\r\\nglutton, do you find money to pay for these dainties?\" exclaimed his\\r\\nfather, coming close up to him, with angry gestures.  Piedro\\'s mouth was\\r\\nmuch too full to make an immediate reply, nor did his father wait for\\r\\nany, but darting his hand into the youth\\'s pocket, pulled forth a handful\\r\\nof silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The money, father,\" said Piedro, \"that I got for the fish yesterday, and\\r\\nthat I meant to give you to-day, before you went out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll make you remember it against another time, sirrah!\" said his\\r\\nfather.  \"I\\'ll teach you to fill your stomach with my money.  Am I to\\r\\nlose my customers by your tricks, and then find you here eating my all?\\r\\nYou are a rogue, and everybody has found you out to be a rogue; and the\\r\\nworst of rogues I find you, who scruples not to cheat his own father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, with great vehemence he seized hold of Piedro, and in\\r\\nthe very midst of the little fruit-market gave him a severe beating.\\r\\nThis beating did the boy no good; it was vengeance not punishment.\\r\\nPiedro saw that his father was in a passion, and knew that he was beaten\\r\\nbecause he was found out to be a rogue, rather than for being one.  He\\r\\nrecollected perfectly that his father once said to him:  \"Let everyone\\r\\ntake care of his own grapes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been\\r\\neducated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way\\r\\nof trade, should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards\\r\\nthe father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing,\\r\\nbut his mind was not in the least amended.  On the contrary, he was\\r\\nhardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation.  All the little\\r\\nmerchants were spectators of this scene, and heard his father\\'s words:\\r\\n\"You ARE a rogue, and the worst of rogues, who scruples not to cheat his\\r\\nown father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were long remembered, and long did Piedro feel their effects.\\r\\nHe once flattered himself that, when his trade of selling fish failed\\r\\nhim, he could readily engage in some other; but he now found, to his\\r\\nmortification, that what Francisco\\'s father said proved true:  \"In all\\r\\ntrades the best fortune to set up with is a good character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter into\\r\\npartnership with him, give him credit, or even trade with him for ready\\r\\nmoney.  \"If you would cheat your own father, to be sure you will cheat\\r\\nus,\" was continually said to him by these prudent little people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad.  His\\r\\nfather, when he found that his son\\'s smartness was no longer useful in\\r\\nmaking bargains, shoved him out of his way whenever he met him.  All the\\r\\nfood or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly,\\r\\nand with such expressions as these:  \"Take that; but it is too good for\\r\\nyou.  You must eat this, now, instead of gourds and figs--and be thankful\\r\\nyou have even this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro spent a whole winter very unhappily.  He expected that all his old\\r\\ntricks, and especially what his father had said of him in the market-\\r\\nplace, would be soon forgotten; but month passed after month, and still\\r\\nthese things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not easy to get rid of a bad character.  A very great rogue * was\\r\\nonce heard to say, that he would, with all his heart, give ten thousand\\r\\npounds for a good character, because he knew that he could make twenty\\r\\nthousand by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chartres.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he\\r\\nexperienced the evils of a bad reputation, and when he saw the numerous\\r\\nadvantages which Francisco\\'s good character procured.  Such had been\\r\\nPiedro\\'s wretched education, that even the hard lessons of experience\\r\\ncould not alter its pernicious effects.  He was sorry his knavery had\\r\\nbeen detected, but he still thought it clever to cheat, and was secretly\\r\\npersuaded that, if he had cheated successfully, he should have been\\r\\nhappy.  \"But I know I am not happy now,\" said he to himself one morning,\\r\\nas he sat alone disconsolate by the sea-shore, dressed in tattered\\r\\ngarments, weak and hungry, with an empty basket beside him.  His fishing-\\r\\nrod, which he held between his knees, bent over the dry sands instead of\\r\\ninto the water, for he was not thinking of what he was about; his arms\\r\\nwere folded, his head hung down, and his ragged hat was slouched over his\\r\\nface.  He was a melancholy spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco, as he was coming from his father\\'s vineyard with a large dish\\r\\nof purple and white grapes upon his head, and a basket of melons and figs\\r\\nhanging upon his arm, chanced to see Piedro seated in this melancholy\\r\\nposture.  Touched with compassion, Francisco approached him softly; his\\r\\nfootsteps were not heard upon the sands, and Piedro did not perceive that\\r\\nanyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand; he then\\r\\nstarted, and, looking up, saw a bunch of grapes, which Francisco was\\r\\nholding over his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eat them:  you\\'ll find them very good, I hope,\" said Francisco, with a\\r\\nbenevolent smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are excellent--most excellent, and I am much obliged to you,\\r\\nFrancisco,\" said Piedro.  \"I was very hungry, and that\\'s what I am now,\\r\\nwithout anybody\\'s caring anything about it.  I am not the favourite I was\\r\\nwith my father, but I know it is all my own fault.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but cheer up,\" said Francisco; \"my father always says, \\'One who\\r\\nknows he has been in fault, and acknowledges it, will scarcely be in\\r\\nfault again.\\'  Yes, take as many figs as you will,\" continued he; and\\r\\nheld his basket closer to Piedro, who, as he saw, cast a hungry eye upon\\r\\none of the ripe figs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Piedro, after he had taken several, \"shall not I get you into\\r\\na scrape by taking so many?  Won\\'t your father be apt to miss them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think I would give them to you if they were not my own?\" said\\r\\nFrancisco, with a sudden glance of indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, don\\'t be angry that I asked the question; it was only from fear of\\r\\ngetting you into disgrace that I asked it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy for anybody to do that, I hope,\" said Francisco,\\r\\nrather proudly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to me less than anybody,\" replied Piedro, in an insinuating tone,\\r\\n\"_I,_ that am so much obliged to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bunch of grapes, and a few figs, are no mighty obligation,\" said\\r\\nFrancisco, smiling; \"I wish I could do more for you.  You seem, indeed,\\r\\nto have been very unhappy of late.  We never see you in the markets as we\\r\\nused to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; ever since my father beat me, and called me rogue before all the\\r\\nchildren there, I have never been able to show my face without being\\r\\ngibed at by one or t\\'other.  If you would but take me along with you\\r\\namongst them, and only just SEEM my friend, for a day or two, or so, it\\r\\nwould quite set me up again; for they all like you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would rather BE than seem your friend, if I could,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, to be sure; that would be still better,\" said Piedro, observing that\\r\\nFrancisco, as he uttered his last sentence, was separating the grapes and\\r\\nother fruits into two equal divisions.  \"To be sure I would rather you\\r\\nwould BE than SEEM a friend to me; but I thought that was too much to ask\\r\\nat first, though I have a notion, notwithstanding I have been so UNLUCKY\\r\\nlately--I have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it.  You\\r\\nwould find me no bad hand, if you were to try, and take me into\\r\\npartnership.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Partnership!\" interrupted Francisco, drawing back alarmed; \"I had no\\r\\nthoughts of that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But won\\'t you? can\\'t you?\" said Piedro, in a supplicating tone; \"CAN\\'T\\r\\nyou have thoughts of it?  You\\'d find me a very active partner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranscisco still drew back, and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground.  He\\r\\nwas embarrassed; for he pitied Piedro, and he scarcely knew how to point\\r\\nout to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides\\r\\nactivity, and that is honesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" repeated Piedro, thinking that he hesitated from merely\\r\\nmercenary motives.  \"You shall have what share of the profits you\\r\\nplease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not thinking of the profits,\" said Francisco;  \"but without\\r\\nmeaning to be ill-natured to you, Piedro, I must say that I cannot enter\\r\\ninto any partnership with you at present; but I will do what, perhaps,\\r\\nyou will like as well,\" said he, taking half the fruit out of his basket;\\r\\n\"you are heartily welcome to this; try and sell it in the children\\'s\\r\\nfruit market.  I\\'ll go on before you, and speak to those I am acquainted\\r\\nwith, and tell them you are going to set up a new character, and that you\\r\\nhope to make it a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, shall I!  Thank you for ever, dear Francisco,\" cried Piedro,\\r\\nseizing his plentiful gift of fruit.  \"Say what you please for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t make me say anything that is not true,\" said Francisco,\\r\\npausing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure not,\" said Piedro; \"I DO mean to give no room for\\r\\nscandal.  If I could get them to trust me as they do you, I should be\\r\\nhappy indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what you may do, if you please,\" said Francisco.  \"Adieu, I wish\\r\\nyou well with all my heart; but I must leave you now, or I shall be too\\r\\nlate for the market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Chi va piano va sano, e anche lontano.\\r\\n     Fair and softly goes far in a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character.  When he\\r\\nwent into the market with his grapes and figs, he found that he was not\\r\\nshunned or taunted as usual.  All seemed disposed to believe in his\\r\\nintended reformation, and to give him a fair trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s benevolent representations.  He told them that he thought\\r\\nPiedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks, and that it would\\r\\nbe cruelty in them, because he might once have been in fault, to banish\\r\\nhim by their reproaches from amongst them, and thus to prevent him from\\r\\nthe means of gaining his livelihood honestly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro made a good beginning, and gave what several of the younger\\r\\ncustomers thought excellent bargains.  His grapes and figs were quickly\\r\\nsold, and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased\\r\\nfrom a fruit dealer a fresh supply; and thus he went on for some time,\\r\\nconducting himself with scrupulous honesty, so that he acquired some\\r\\ncredit among his companions.  They no longer watched him with suspicious\\r\\neyes.  They trusted to his measures and weights, and they counted less\\r\\ncarefully the change which they received from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at\\r\\nfirst delightful to Piedro; but in proportion to his credit, his\\r\\nopportunities of defrauding increased; and these became temptations which\\r\\nhe had not the firmness to resist.  His old manner of thinking recurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I make but a few shillings a day, and this is but slow work,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself.  \"What signifies my good character, if I make so little by it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLight gains, and frequent, make a heavy purse, * was one of Francisco\\'s\\r\\nproverbs.  But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time\\r\\ninto his account.  He set his invention to work, and he did not want for\\r\\ningenuity, to devise means of cheating without running the risk of\\r\\ndetection.  He observed that the younger part of the community were\\r\\nextremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums, and of burnt almonds.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Poco e spesso empie il l\\'orsetto.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the money he had earned by two months\\' trading in fruit he laid in a\\r\\nlarge stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds\\r\\nand sugar-plums, and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his\\r\\nboard, \"Sweetest, largest, most admirable sugar-plums of all colours ever\\r\\nsold in Naples, to be had here; and in gratitude to his numerous\\r\\ncustomers, Piedro adds to these, \\'Burnt almonds gratis.\\'\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read; and\\r\\nmany who could not read heard it repeated with delight.  Crowds of\\r\\nchildren surrounded Piedro\\'s board of promise, and they all went away the\\r\\nfirst day amply satisfied.  Each had a full measure of coloured sugar-\\r\\nplums at the usual price, and along with these a burnt almond gratis.\\r\\nThe burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment, that it was\\r\\nuniversally allowed that the sugar-plums were, as the advertisement set\\r\\nforth, the largest, sweetest, most admirable ever sold in Naples; though\\r\\nall the time they were, in no respect, better than any other sugar-plums.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was generally reported that Piedro gave full measure--fuller than any\\r\\nother board in the city.  He measured the sugar-plums in a little cubical\\r\\ntin box; and this, it was affirmed, he heaped up to the top, and pressed\\r\\ndown before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his\\r\\napproving customers.  This belief, and Piedro\\'s popularity, continued\\r\\nlonger even than he had expected; and, as he thought his sugar-plums had\\r\\nsecured their reputation with the GENEROUS PUBLIC, he gradually neglected\\r\\nto add burnt almonds gratis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by, whistling as\\r\\nhe went along, and swinging a carpenter\\'s rule in his hand.  \"Ha! what\\r\\nhave we here?\" cried he, stopping to read what was written on Piedro\\'s\\r\\nboard.  \"This promises rarely.  Old as I am, and tall of my age, which\\r\\nmakes the matter worse, I am still as fond of sugar-plums as my little\\r\\nsister, who is five years younger than I.  Come, Signor, fill me quick,\\r\\nfor I\\'m in haste to taste them, two measures of the sweetest, largest,\\r\\nmost admirable sugar-plums in Naples--one measure for myself and one for\\r\\nmy little Rosetta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll pay for yourself and your sister, then,\" said Piedro, \"for no\\r\\ncredit is given here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No credit do I ask,\" replied the lively boy; \"when I told you I loved\\r\\nsugar-plums, did I tell you I loved them, or even my sister, so well as\\r\\nto run in debt for them?  Here\\'s for myself, and here\\'s for my sister\\'s\\r\\nshare,\" said he, laying down his money; \"and now for the burnt almonds\\r\\ngratis, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all out; I have been out of burnt almonds this great while,\"\\r\\nsaid Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why are they in your advertisement here?\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not had time to scratch them out of the board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not when you have, by your own account, been out of them a great\\r\\nwhile?  I did not know it required so much time to blot out a few words--\\r\\nlet us try.\"; and as he spoke, Carlo, for that was the name of Piedro\\'s\\r\\nnew customer, pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket, and drew a\\r\\nbroad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds\\r\\ngratis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are most impatient,\" said Piedro; \"I shall have a fresh stock of\\r\\nalmonds to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why must the board tell a lie to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would ruin me to alter it,\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lie may ruin you, but I could scarcely think the truth could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no right to meddle with me or my board,\" said Piedro, put off\\r\\nhis guard, and out of his usual soft voice of civility, by this last\\r\\nobservation.  \"My character, and that of my board, are too firmly\\r\\nestablished now for any chance customer like you to injure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else,\" said Carlo--\"I wish,\\r\\nmoreover, you may not injure yourself.  Do as you please with your board,\\r\\nbut give me my sugar-plums, for I have some right to meddle with those,\\r\\nhaving paid for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold out your hand, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, put them in here, if you please; put my sister\\'s, at least, in here;\\r\\nshe likes to have them in this box:  I bought some for her in it\\r\\nyesterday, and she\\'ll think they\\'ll taste the better out of the same box.\\r\\nBut how is this? your measure does not fill my box nearly; you give us\\r\\nvery few sugar-plums for our money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I give you full measure, as I give to everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The measure should be an inch cube, I know,\" said Carlo; \"that\\'s what\\r\\nall the little merchants have agreed to, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Piedro, \"so it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so it is, I must allow,\" said Carlo, measuring the outside of it\\r\\nwith the carpenter\\'s rule which he held in his hand.  \"An inch every way;\\r\\nand yet by my eye--and I have no bad one, being used to measuring\\r\\ncarpenter\\'s work for my father--by my eye I should think this would have\\r\\nheld more sugar-plums.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The eye often deceives us;\" said Piedro.  \"There\\'s nothing like\\r\\nmeasuring, you find.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing like measuring, I find, indeed,\" replied Carlo, as he\\r\\nlooked closely at the end of his rule, which, since he spoke last, he had\\r\\nput into the cube to take its depth in the inside.  \"This is not as deep\\r\\nby a quarter of an inch, Signor Piedro, measured within as it is measured\\r\\nwithout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro changed colour terribly, and seizing hold of the tin box,\\r\\nendeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately.  Carlo\\r\\nheld his prize fast, and lifting it above his head, he ran into the midst\\r\\nof the square where the little market was held, exclaiming, \"A discovery!\\r\\na discovery! that concerns all who love sugar-plums.  A discovery! a\\r\\ndiscovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest, and most\\r\\nadmirable sugar-plums ever sold in Naples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have bought,\" and \"We have bought of those sugar-plums,\" cried\\r\\nseveral little voices at once, \"if you mean Piedro\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same,\" continued Carlo--\"he who, out of gratitude to his numerous\\r\\ncustomers, gives, or promises to give, burnt almonds gratis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent they were!\" cried several voices.  \"We all know Piedro well;\\r\\nbut what\\'s your discovery?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My discovery is,\" said Carlo, \"that you, none of you, know Piedro.  Look\\r\\nyou here; look at this box--this is his measure; it has a false bottom--\\r\\nit holds only three-quarters as much as it ought to do; and his numerous\\r\\ncustomers have all been cheated of one-quarter of every measure of the\\r\\nadmirable sugar-plums they have bought from him.  \\'Think twice of a good\\r\\nbargain,\\' says the proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So we have been finely duped, indeed,\" cried some of the bystanders,\\r\\nlooking at one another with a mortified air.  \"Full of courtesy, full of\\r\\ncraft!\" *  \"So this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis,\" cried\\r\\nothers; all joined in an uproar of indignation, except one, who, as he\\r\\nstood behind the rest, expressed in his countenance silent surprise and\\r\\nsorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chi et FA pi caress che non vole,\\r\\nO ingannato t\\'ha, o inganuar et vole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this Piedro a relation of yours?\" said Carlo, going up to this silent\\r\\nperson.  \"I am sorry, if he be, that I have published his disgrace, for I\\r\\nwould not hurt YOU.  You don\\'t sell sugar-plums as he does, I\\'m sure; for\\r\\nmy little sister Rosetta has often bought from you.  Can this Piedro be a\\r\\nfriend of yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wished to have been his friend; but I see I can\\'t,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\"He is a neighbour of ours, and I pitied him; but since he is at his old\\r\\ntricks again, there\\'s an end of the matter.  I have reason to be obliged\\r\\nto you, for I was nearly taken in.  He has behaved so well for some time\\r\\npast, that I intended this very evening to have gone to him, and to have\\r\\ntold him that I was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me\\r\\nto do--to enter into partnership with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Francisco! Francisco!--your measure, lend us your measure!\" exclaimed a\\r\\nnumber of little merchants crowding round him.  \"You have a measure for\\r\\nsugar-plums; and we have all agreed to refer to that, and to see how much\\r\\nwe have been cheated before we go to break Piedro\\'s bench and declare him\\r\\nbankrupt, *--the punishment for all knaves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* This word comes from two Italian words, bunco rotto--broken bench.\\r\\nBankers and merchants used formerly to count their money, and write their\\r\\nbills of exchange upon benches in the streets; and when a merchant or\\r\\nbanker lost his credit, and was unable to pay his debts, his bench was\\r\\nbroken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey pressed on to Francisco\\'s board, obtained his measure, found that it\\r\\nheld something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be\\r\\ncontained in Piedro\\'s.  The cries of the enraged populace were now most\\r\\nclamorous.  They hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles;\\r\\nand, forming themselves into a formidable phalanx, they proceeded towards\\r\\nPiedro\\'s well known yellow lettered board, exclaiming, as they went\\r\\nalong, \"Common cause! common cause!  The little Neapolitan merchants will\\r\\nhave no knaves amongst them!  Break his bench! break his bench!  He is a\\r\\nbankrupt in honesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro saw the mob, heard the indignant clamour, and, terrified at the\\r\\napproach of numbers, he fled with the utmost precipitation, having\\r\\nscarcely time to pack up half his sugar-plums.  There was a prodigious\\r\\nnumber, more than would have filled many honest measures, scattered upon\\r\\nthe ground and trampled under foot by the crowd.  Piedro\\'s bench was\\r\\nbroken, and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous\\r\\npainted board.  It was, after being much disfigured by various\\r\\ninscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for Piedro, hung up in\\r\\na conspicuous part of the market-place; and the false measure was\\r\\nfastened like a cap upon one of its corners.  Piedro could never more\\r\\nshow his face in this market, and all hopes of friendship--all hopes of\\r\\npartnership with Francisco--were for ever at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf rogues would calculate, they would cease to be rogues; for they would\\r\\ncertainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest--\\r\\nsetting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved, of having a\\r\\nsafe conscience, with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments\\r\\nand terror to which knaves are subject.  Is it not clear that our crafty\\r\\nhero would have gained rather more by a partnership with Francisco, and\\r\\nby a fair character, than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing\\r\\nin comfits?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the mob had dispersed, after satisfying themselves with executing\\r\\nsummary justice upon Piedro\\'s bench and board, Francisco found a\\r\\ncarpenter\\'s rule lying upon the ground near Piedro\\'s broken bench, which\\r\\nhe recollected to have seen in the hands of Carlo.  He examined it\\r\\ncarefully, and he found Carlo\\'s name written upon it, and the name of the\\r\\nstreet where he lived; and though it was considerably out of his way, he\\r\\nset out immediately to restore the rule, which was a very handsome one,\\r\\nto its rightful owner.  After a hot walk through several streets, he\\r\\novertook Carlo, who had just reached the door of his own house.  Carlo\\r\\nwas particularly obliged to him, he said, for restoring this rule to him,\\r\\nas it was a present from the master of a vessel, who employed his father\\r\\nto do carpenter\\'s work for him.  \"One should not praise one\\'s self, they\\r\\nsay,\" continued Carlo, \"but I long so much to gain your good opinion,\\r\\nthat I must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored.  It\\r\\nwas given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a\\r\\nwhole pleasure-boat myself.  You may guess I should have been sorry\\r\\nenough to have lost it.  Thank you for its being once more in my careless\\r\\nhands, and tell me, I beg, whenever I can do you any service.  By-the-by,\\r\\nI can make up for you a fruit stall.  I\\'ll do it to-morrow, and it shall\\r\\nbe the admiration of the market.  Is there anything else you could think\\r\\nof for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes,\" said Francisco; \"since you are so good-natured, perhaps you\\'d\\r\\nbe kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures\\r\\nthat I see upon your rule.  I have a great curiosity to know their use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I\\'ll explain to you with pleasure, as far as I know them myself;\\r\\nbut when I\\'m at fault, my father, who is cleverer than I am, and\\r\\nunderstands trigonometry, can help us out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Trigonometry!\" repeated Francisco, not a little alarmed at the high\\r\\nsounding word; \"that\\'s what I certainly shall never understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never fear,\" replied Carlo, laughing.  \"I looked just as you do now-\\r\\n-I felt just as you do now--all in a fright and a puzzle, when I first\\r\\nheard of angles and sines, and cosines, and arcs and centres, and\\r\\ncomplements and tangents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh mercy! mercy!\" interrupted Francisco, whilst Carlo laughed, with a\\r\\nbenevolent sense of superiority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Carlo, \"you\\'ll find all these things are nothing when you are\\r\\nused to them.  But I cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the\\r\\nsun.  Besides, it will not be the work of a day, I promise you; but come\\r\\nand see us at your leisure hours, and we\\'ll study it together.  I have a\\r\\ngreat notion we shall become friends; and, to begin, step in with me\\r\\nnow,\" said Carlo, \"and eat a little macaroni with us.  I know it is ready\\r\\nby this time.  Besides, you\\'ll see my father, and he\\'ll show you plenty\\r\\nof rules and compasses, as you like such things; and then I\\'ll go home\\r\\nwith you in the cool of the evening, and you shall show me your melons\\r\\nand vines, and teach me, in time, something of gardening.  Oh, I see we\\r\\nmust be good friends, just made for each other; so come in--no ceremony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo was not mistaken in his predictions; he and Francisco became very\\r\\ngood friends, spent all their leisure hours together, either in Carlo\\'s\\r\\nworkshop or in Francisco\\'s vineyard, and they mutually improved each\\r\\nother.  Francisco, before he saw his friend\\'s rule, knew but just enough\\r\\nof arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he\\r\\nsold in the market; but with Carlo\\'s assistance, and the ambition to\\r\\nunderstand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule, he set to work\\r\\nin earnest, and in due time, satisfied both himself and his master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who knows but these things that I am learning now may be of some use to\\r\\nme before I die?\" said Francisco, as he was sitting one morning with his\\r\\ntutor, the carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it will,\" said the carpenter, putting down his compasses,\\r\\nwith which he was drawing a circle--\"Arithmetic is a most useful, and I\\r\\nwas going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations; and\\r\\na little trigonometry does no harm.  In short, my maxim is, that no\\r\\nknowledge comes amiss; for a man\\'s head is of as much use to him as his\\r\\nhands; and even more so.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"A word to the wise will always suffice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Besides, to say nothing of making a fortune, is not there a great\\r\\npleasure in being something of a scholar, and being able to pass one\\'s\\r\\ntime with one\\'s book, and one\\'s compasses and pencil?  Safe companions\\r\\nthese for young and old.  No one gets into mischief that has pleasant\\r\\nthings to think of and to do when alone; and I know, for my part, that\\r\\ntrigonometry is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the carpenter, just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric\\r\\nupon his favourite trigonometry, was interrupted by the sudden entrance\\r\\nof his little daughter Rosetta, all in tears:  a very unusual spectacle,\\r\\nfor, taking the year round, she shed fewer tears than any child of her\\r\\nage in Naples.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my dear good humoured little Rosetta, what has happened?  Why these\\r\\nlarge tears?\" said her brother Carlo, and he went up to her, and wiped\\r\\nthem from her cheeks.  \"And these that are going over the bridge of the\\r\\nnose so fast?  I must stop these tears, too,\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosetta, at this speech, burst out laughing, and said that she did not\\r\\nknow till then that she had any bridge on her nose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And were these shells the cause of the tears?\" said her brother, looking\\r\\nat a heap of shells, which she held before her in her frock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, partly,\" said Rosetta.  \"It was partly my own fault, but not all.\\r\\nYou know I went out to the carpenter\\'s yard, near the arsenal, where all\\r\\nthe children are picking up chips and sticks so busily; and I was as busy\\r\\nas any of them, because I wanted to fill my basket soon; and then I\\r\\nthought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood-market.\\r\\nAs soon as I had filled my basket, and made up my faggot (which was not\\r\\ndone, brother, till I was almost baked by the sun, for I was forced to\\r\\nwait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot)--I say,\\r\\nwhen it was all ready, and my basket full, I left it altogether in the\\r\\nyard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was not wise to leave it,\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I only left it for a few minutes, brother, and I could not think\\r\\nanybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst I was away.  I only\\r\\njust ran to tell a boy, who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon\\r\\nthe sea-shore, and who wanted to sell them, that I should be glad to buy\\r\\nthem from him, if he would only be so good as to keep them for me, for an\\r\\nhour or so, till I had carried my wood to market, and till I had sold it,\\r\\nand so had money to pay him for the shells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your heart was set mightily on these shells, Rosetta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; for I thought you and Francisco, brother, would like to have them\\r\\nfor your nice grotto that you are making at Resina.  That was the reason\\r\\nI was in such a hurry to get them.  The boy who had them to sell was very\\r\\ngood-natured; he poured them into my lap, and said I had such an honest\\r\\nface he would trust me, and that as he was in a great hurry, he could not\\r\\nwait an hour whilst I sold my wood; but that he was sure I would pay him\\r\\nin the evening, and he told me that he would call here this evening for\\r\\nthe money.  But now what shall I do, Carlo?  I shall have no money to\\r\\ngive him:  I must give back his shells, and that\\'s a great pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how happened it that you did not sell your wood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I forgot; did not I tell you that?  When I went for my basket, do\\r\\nyou know it was empty, quite empty, not a chip left?  Some dishonest\\r\\nperson had carried it all off.  Had not I reason to cry now, Carlo?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go this minute into the wood-market, and see if I can find your\\r\\nfaggot.  Won\\'t that be better than crying?\" said her brother.  \"Should\\r\\nyou know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, one of them, I am sure, I should know again,\" said Rosetta.  \"It\\r\\nhad a notch at one end of it, where one of the carpenters cut it off from\\r\\nanother piece of wood for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be\\r\\nseen?\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is in the yard; but I cannot bring it to you, for it is very\\r\\nheavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can go to it,\" said Francisco, \"and I hope we shall recover your\\r\\nbasketful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo and his friend went with Rosetta immediately to the yard, near the\\r\\narsenal, saw the notched piece of wood, and then proceeded to the little\\r\\nwood-market, and searched every heap that lay before the little factors;\\r\\nbut no notched bit was to be found, and Rosetta declared that she did not\\r\\nsee one stick that looked at all like any of hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their part, her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them\\r\\nto her, and exclaimed, \"That they were incapable of taking what did not\\r\\nbelong to them; that of all persons they should never have thought of\\r\\ntaking anything from the good natured little Rosetta, who was always\\r\\nready to give to others, and to help them in making up their loads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDespairing of discovering the thief, Francisco and Carlo left the market.\\r\\nAs they were returning home, they were met by the English servant Arthur,\\r\\nwho asked Francisco where he had been, and where he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he heard of Rosetta\\'s lost faggot, and of the bit of wood,\\r\\nnotched at one end, of which Rosetta drew the shape with a piece of\\r\\nchalk, which her brother had lent her, Arthur exclaimed, \"I have seen\\r\\nsuch a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour; but I cannot\\r\\nrecollect where.  Stay! this was at the baker\\'s, I think, where I went\\r\\nfor some rolls for my master.  It was lying beside his oven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the baker\\'s they all went as fast as possible, and they got there but\\r\\njust in time.  The baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he\\r\\nwas that instant going to feed his oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop, good Mr. Baker!\" cried Rosetta, who ran into the baker\\'s shop\\r\\nfirst; and as he heard \"Stop! stop!\" re-echoed by many voices, the baker\\r\\nstopped; and turning to Francisco, Carlo and Arthur, begged, with a\\r\\ncountenance of some surprise, to know why they had desired him to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was easily explained, and the baker told them that he did not\\r\\nbuy any wood in the little market that morning; that this faggot he had\\r\\npurchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s height, whom he met near the yard of the arsenal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my bit of wood, I am sure; I know it by this notch,\" said\\r\\nRosetta.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the baker, \"if you will stay here a few minutes, you will\\r\\nprobably see the lad who sold it to me.  He desired to be paid in bread,\\r\\nand my bread was not quite baked when he was here.  I bid him call again\\r\\nin an hour, and I fancy he will be pretty punctual, for he looked\\r\\ndesperately hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco, who was standing\\r\\nwatching at the door, exclaimed, \"Here comes Piedro!  I hope he is not\\r\\nthe boy who sold you the wood, Mr. Baker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the boy, though,\" replied the baker, and Piedro, who now entered\\r\\nthe shop, started at the sight of Carlo and Francisco, whom he had never\\r\\nseen since the day of disgrace in the fruit-market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your servant, Signor Piedro,\" said Carlo; \"I have the honour to tell you\\r\\nthat this piece of wood, and all that you took out of the basket, which\\r\\nyou found in the yard of the arsenal, belongs to my sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Rosetta.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied Rosetta\\'s\\r\\nbasket, and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion\\r\\nof a child like Rosetta, who might be baffled and frightened out of her\\r\\nstory, boldly denied the charge, and defied any one to prove him guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has a right to be heard in his own defence,\" said Arthur, with the\\r\\ncool justice of an Englishman; and he stopped the angry Carlo\\'s arm, who\\r\\nwas going up to the culprit with all the Italian vehemence of oratory and\\r\\ngesture.  Arthur went on to say something in bad Italian about the\\r\\nexcellence of an English trial by jury, which Carlo was too much enraged\\r\\nto hear, but to which Francisco paid attention, and turning to Piedro, he\\r\\nasked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart,\" said Piedro, still maintaining an unmoved\\r\\ncountenance, and they returned immediately to the little wood-market.  On\\r\\ntheir way, they had passed through the fruit-market, and crowds of those\\r\\nwho were well acquainted with Piedro\\'s former transactions followed, to\\r\\nhear the event of the present trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur could not, especially as he spoke wretched Italian, make the eager\\r\\nlittle merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial\\r\\nby jury.  They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding.\\r\\nFrancisco, in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence, was chosen\\r\\nwith unanimous shouts for the judge; but he declined the office, and\\r\\nanother was appointed.  He was raised upon a bench, and the guilty but\\r\\ninsolent looking Piedro, and the ingenuous, modest Rosetta stood before\\r\\nhim.  She made her complaint in a very artless manner; and Piedro, with\\r\\ningenuity, which in a better cause would have deserved admiration, spoke\\r\\nvolubly and craftily in his own defence.  But all that he could say could\\r\\nnot alter facts.  The judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the\\r\\nbaker\\'s with a piece from which it was cut, which he went to see in the\\r\\nyard of the arsenal.  It was found to fit exactly.  The judge then found\\r\\nit impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators.\\r\\nThe prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market; and the\\r\\nmoment sentence was pronounced, Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the\\r\\nmarket-place.  Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of\\r\\nearning his bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades\\r\\nhe next attempted.  He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he\\r\\nwas not known, but he lost his customers by putting too much water and\\r\\ntoo little lemon into this beverage.  He then took to the waters from the\\r\\nsulphurous springs, and served them about to foreigners; but one day, as\\r\\nhe was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door, he slipped his\\r\\nfoot, and broke his glasses.  They had been borrowed from an old woman,\\r\\nwho hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade.  Piedro knew that it\\r\\nwas the custom to pay, of course, for all that was broken; but this he\\r\\nwas not inclined to do.  He had a few shillings in his pocket, and\\r\\nthought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her\\r\\nright, and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he\\r\\ndid his good name--macaroni.  The shillings were soon gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now for the present leave Piedro to his follies and his fate;\\r\\nor, to speak more properly, to his follies and their inevitable\\r\\nconsequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends,\\r\\nwithout neglecting his own or his father\\'s business.  He contrived,\\r\\nduring the course of autumn and winter, to make himself a tolerable\\r\\narithmetician.  Carlo\\'s father could draw plans in architecture neatly;\\r\\nand pleased with the eagerness Francisco showed to receive instruction,\\r\\nhe willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand, and taught him all\\r\\nhe knew himself.  Francisco had great perseverance, and, by repeated\\r\\ntrials, he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his\\r\\nmaster lent him.  His copies, in time, surpassed the originals, and Carlo\\r\\nexclaimed, with astonishment:  \"Why, Francisco, what an astonishing\\r\\nGENIUS you have for drawing!--Absolutely you draw plans better than my\\r\\nfather!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to genius,\" said Francisco, honestly, \"I have none.  All that I have\\r\\ndone has been done by hard labour.  I don\\'t know how other people do\\r\\nthings; but I am sure that I never have been able to get anything done\\r\\nwell but by patience.  Don\\'t you remember, Carlo, how you and even\\r\\nRosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my\\r\\nawkward, clumsy hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" said Carlo, laughing again at the recollection, \"you held your\\r\\npencil so drolly; and when you were to cut it, you cut it just as if you\\r\\nwere using a pruning-knife to your vines; but now it is your turn to\\r\\nlaugh, for you surpass us all.  And the times are changed since I set\\r\\nabout to explain this rule of mine to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, that rule,\" said Francisco--\"how much I owe to it!  Some great\\r\\npeople, when they lose any of their fine things, cause the crier to\\r\\npromise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore\\r\\ntheir trinket.  How richly have you and your father rewarded me for\\r\\nreturning this rule!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s modesty and gratitude, as they were perfectly sincere,\\r\\nattached his friends to him most powerfully; but there was one person who\\r\\nregretted our hero\\'s frequent absences from his vineyard at Resina.  Not\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s father, for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his\\r\\nbusiness; and as to the hours spent in Naples, he had so much confidence\\r\\nin Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad\\r\\ncompany.  When his son had once said to him, \"I spend my time at such a\\r\\nplace, and in such and such a manner,\" he was as well convinced of its\\r\\nbeing so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day.  But\\r\\nit was Arthur who complained of Francisco\\'s absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see, because I am an Englishman,\" said he, \"you don\\'t value my\\r\\nfriendship, and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it; no\\r\\nfriends so good as the English, be it spoken without offence to your\\r\\nItalian friend, for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and\\r\\ndown here in Resina, without a soul that I like to speak to, for you are\\r\\nthe only Italian I ever liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall like another, I promise you,\" said Francisco.  \"You must come\\r\\nwith me to Carlo\\'s, and see how I spend my evenings; then complain of me,\\r\\nif you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the utmost stretch of Arthur\\'s complaisance to pay this visit;\\r\\nbut, in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper,\\r\\nhe was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and\\r\\nthe playful Rosetta.  They showed him Francisco\\'s drawings with\\r\\nenthusiastic eagerness; and Arthur, though no great judge of drawing, was\\r\\nin astonishment, and frequently repeated, \"I know a gentleman who visits\\r\\nmy master who would like these things.  I wish I might have them to show\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take them, then,\" said Carlo; \"I wish all Naples could see them,\\r\\nprovided they might be liked half as well as I like them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur carried off the drawings, and one day, when his master was better\\r\\nthan usual, and when he was at leisure, eating a dessert of Francisco\\'s\\r\\ngrapes, he entered respectfully, with his little portfolio under his arm,\\r\\nand begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the\\r\\ngardener\\'s son, whose grapes he was eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic Carlo, this\\r\\ngentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings,\\r\\nconsidering how short a time Francisco had applied himself to this art,\\r\\nand what slight instructions he had received.  Arthur was desired to\\r\\nsummon the young artist.  Francisco\\'s honest, open manner, joined to the\\r\\nproofs he had given of his abilities, and the character Arthur gave him\\r\\nfor strict honesty, and constant kindness to his parents, interested Mr.\\r\\nLee, the name of this English gentleman, much in his favour.  Mr. Lee was\\r\\nat this time in treaty with an Italian painter, whom he wished to engage\\r\\nto copy for him exactly some of the cornices, mouldings, tablets, and\\r\\nantique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient\\r\\ncity of Herculaneum. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* We must give those of our young English readers who may not be\\r\\nacquainted with the ancient city of Herculaneum, some idea of it.  None\\r\\ncan be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of\\r\\nVesuvius;--that, from time to time, there happen violent eruptions from\\r\\nthis mountain; that is to say, flames and immense clouds of smoke issue\\r\\nfrom different openings, mouths, or CRATERS, as they are called, but more\\r\\nespecially from the summit of the mountain, which is distinguished by the\\r\\nname of THE crater.  A rumbling, and afterwards a roaring noise is heard\\r\\nwithin, and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into\\r\\nmasses (scoriae), are thrown out of the crater, sometimes to a great\\r\\ndistance.  The hot ashes from Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon\\r\\nthe roofs of the houses of Naples, from which it is six miles distant.\\r\\nStreams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an\\r\\neruption, destroying everything in their way, and overwhelm the houses\\r\\nand vineyards which are in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 17OO years ago, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus, there\\r\\nhappened a terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius; and a large city called\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was situated at about four miles\\' distance from the\\r\\nvolcano, was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it,\\r\\nfilled up the streets, and quickly covered over the tops of the houses,\\r\\nso that the whole was no more visible.  It remained for many years\\r\\nburied.  The lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation,\\r\\nplants grew there, a new soil was formed, and a new town called Portici\\r\\nwas built over this place where Herculaneum formerly stood.  The little\\r\\nvillage of Resina is also situated near the spot.  About fifty years ago,\\r\\nin a poor man\\'s garden at Resina, a hole in a well about thirty feet\\r\\nbelow the surface of the earth was observed.  Some persons had the\\r\\ncuriosity to enter into this hole, and, after creeping underground for\\r\\nsome time, they came to the foundations of houses.  The peasants,\\r\\ninhabitants of the village, who had probably never heard of Herculaneum,\\r\\nwere somewhat surprised at their discovery.**  About the same time, in a\\r\\npit in the town of Portici, a similar passage underground was discovered,\\r\\nand, by orders of the King of Naples, workmen were employed to dig away\\r\\nthe earth, and clear the passage.  They found, at length, the entrance\\r\\ninto the town, which, during the reign of Titus, was buried under lava.\\r\\nIt was about eighty-eight Neapolitan palms (a palm contains near nine\\r\\ninches) below the top of the pit.  The workmen, as they cleared the\\r\\npassages, marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning, lest\\r\\nthey should lose themselves.  The streets branched out in many\\r\\ndirections, and, lying across them, the workmen often found large pieces\\r\\nof timber, beams, and rafters; some broken in the fall, others entire.\\r\\nThese beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal, except\\r\\nthose that were found in moist places, which have more the colour of\\r\\nrotten wood, and which are like a soft paste, into which you might run\\r\\nyour hand.  The walls of the houses slant, some one way, some another,\\r\\nand some are upright.  Several magnificent buildings of brick, faced with\\r\\nmarble of different colours, are partly seen, where the workmen have\\r\\ncleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted.  Columns\\r\\nof red and white marble, and flights of steps, are seen in different\\r\\nplaces; and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and\\r\\npictures have been dug.  Foreigners who visit Naples are very curious to\\r\\nsee this subterraneous city, and are desirous to carry with them into\\r\\ntheir own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n** Philosophical Transactions, vol. ix. p. 440.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa.\\r\\n     What great events from trivial causes spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignor Camillo, the artist employed by Mr. Lee to copy some of the\\r\\nantique ornaments in Herculaneum, was a liberal minded man, perfectly\\r\\nfree from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising\\r\\ngenius.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a lad scarcely fifteen, a poor gardener\\'s son, who, with merely\\r\\nthe instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter, has learned to\\r\\ndraw these plans and elevations, which you see are tolerably neat.  What\\r\\nan advantage your instruction would be to him,\" said Mr. Lee, as he\\r\\nintroduced Francisco to Signor Camillo.  \"I am interested in this lad\\r\\nfrom what I have learned of his good conduct.  I hear he is strictly\\r\\nhonest, and one of the best of sons.  Let us do something for him.  If\\r\\nyou will give him some knowledge of your art, I will, as far as money can\\r\\nrecompense you for your loss of time, pay whatever you may think\\r\\nreasonable for his instruction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSignor Camillo made no difficulties; he was pleased with his pupil\\'s\\r\\nappearance, and every day he liked him better and better.  In the room\\r\\nwhere they worked together there were some large books of drawings and\\r\\nplates, which Francisco saw now and then opened by his master, and which\\r\\nhe had a great desire to look over; but when he was left in the room by\\r\\nhimself he never touched them, because he had not permission.  Signor\\r\\nCamillo, the first day he came into this room with his pupil, said to\\r\\nhim, \"Here are many valuable books and drawings, young man.  I trust,\\r\\nfrom the character I have heard of you, that they will be perfectly safe\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome weeks after Francisco had been with the painter, they had occasion\\r\\nto look for the front of a temple in one of these large books.  \"What!\\r\\ndon\\'t you know in which book to look for it, Francisco?\" cried his\\r\\nmaster, with some impatience.  \"Is it possible that you have been here so\\r\\nlong with these books, and that you cannot find the print I mean?  Had\\r\\nyou half the taste I gave you credit for, you would have singled it out\\r\\nfrom all the rest, and have it fixed in your memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, signor, I never saw it,\" said Francisco, respectfully, \"or,\\r\\nperhaps, I should have preferred it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you never saw it, young man, is the very thing of which I complain.\\r\\nIs a taste for the arts to be learned, think you, by looking at the cover\\r\\nof a book like this?  Is it possible that you never thought of opening\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Often and often,\" cried Francisco, \"have I longed to open it; but I\\r\\nthought it was forbidden me, and however great my curiosity in your\\r\\nabsence, I have never touched them.  I hoped indeed, that the time would\\r\\ncome when you would have the goodness to show them to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so the time is come, excellent young man,\" cried Camillo; \"much as I\\r\\nlove taste, I love integrity more.  I am now sure of your having the one,\\r\\nand let me see whether you have, as I believe you have, the other.  Sit\\r\\nyou down here beside me; and we will look over these books together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attention with which his young pupil examined everything, and the\\r\\npleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints,\\r\\nsufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want\\r\\nof curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes.\\r\\nHis confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance,\\r\\nslight as it may appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, Signor Camillo came behind Francisco, as he was drawing with\\r\\nmuch intentness, and tapping him upon the shoulder, he said to him:  \"Put\\r\\nup your pencils and follow me, I can depend upon your integrity; I have\\r\\npledged myself for it.  Bring your note-book with you, and follow me; I\\r\\nwill this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much\\r\\nas my large book of prints.  Follow me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco followed, till they came to the pit near the entrance of\\r\\nHerculaneum.  \"I have obtained leave for you to accompany me,\" said his\\r\\nmaster, \"and you know, I suppose, that this is not a permission granted\\r\\nto everyone?\"  Paintings of great value, besides ornaments of gold and\\r\\nsilver, antique bracelets, rings, etc., are from time to time found\\r\\namongst these ruins, and therefore it is necessary that no person should\\r\\nbe admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon.  Thus, even\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s talents could not have advanced him in the world, unless they\\r\\nhad been united to integrity.  He was much delighted and astonished by\\r\\nthe new scene that was now opened to his view; and as, day after day, he\\r\\naccompanied his master to this subterraneous city, he had leisure for\\r\\nobservation.  He was employed, as soon as he had gratified his curiosity,\\r\\nin drawing.  There are niches in the walls in several places, from which\\r\\npictures have been dug, and these niches are often adorned with elegant\\r\\nmasques, figures and animals, which have been left by the ignorant or\\r\\ncareless workmen, and which are going fast to destruction.  Signor\\r\\nCamillo, who was copying these for his English employer, had a mind to\\r\\ntry his pupil\\'s skill, and, pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque\\r\\nfigures, he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it.\\r\\nFrancisco made several trials, and at last finished such an excellent\\r\\ncopy, that his enthusiastic and generous master, with warm encomiums,\\r\\ncarried it immediately to his patron, and he had the pleasure to receive\\r\\nfrom Mr. Lee a purse containing five guineas, as a reward and\\r\\nencouragement for his pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco had no sooner received this money, than he hurried to his\\r\\nfather and mother\\'s cottage.  His mother, some months before this time,\\r\\nhad taken a small dairy farm; and her son had once heard her express a\\r\\nwish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled\\r\\ncow, which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, my dear mother,\" cried Francisco, pouring the guineas into her\\r\\nlap; \"and here,\" continued he, emptying a bag which contained about as\\r\\nmuch more, in small Italian coins, the profits of trade-money he had\\r\\nfairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little\\r\\nNeapolitan merchants; \"this is all yours, dearest mother, and I hope it\\r\\nwill be enough to pay for the brindled cow.  Nay, you must not refuse me-\\r\\n-I have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening;\\r\\nand I\\'ll produce my best bunches of grapes, and my father, perhaps, will\\r\\ngive us a melon; for I\\'ve had no time for melons this season; and I\\'ll\\r\\nstep to Naples and invite--may I, mother?--my good friends, dear Carlo\\r\\nand your favourite little Rosetta, and my old drawing master, and my\\r\\nfriend Arthur, and we\\'ll sup with you at your dairy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happy mother thanked her son, and the father assured him that neither\\r\\nmelon nor pine-apple should be spared, to make a supper worthy of his\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brindled cow was bought, and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta most\\r\\njoyfully accepted their invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day\\r\\nwith one of his employers, and he could not accompany his children.  It\\r\\nwas a delicious evening; they left Naples just as the sea-breeze, after\\r\\nthe heats of the day, was most refreshingly felt.  The walk to Resina,\\r\\nthe vineyard, the dairy, and most of all, the brindled cow, were praised\\r\\nby Carlo and Rosetta, with all the Italian superlatives which signify,\\r\\n\"Most beautiful! most delightful! most charming!\"  Whilst the English\\r\\nArthur, with as warm a heart, was more temperate in his praise, declaring\\r\\nthat this was \"the most like an English summer\\'s evening of any he had\\r\\never felt since he came to Italy:  and that, moreover, the cream was\\r\\nalmost as good as what he had been used to drink in Cheshire.\"  The\\r\\ncompany, who were all pleased with each other, and with the gardener\\'s\\r\\ngood fruit, which he produced in great abundance, did not think of\\r\\nseparating till late.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bright moonlight night, and Carlo asked his friend if he would\\r\\nwalk with them part of the way to Naples.  \"Yes, all the way most\\r\\nwillingly,\" cried Francisco, \"that I may have the pleasure of giving to\\r\\nyour father, with my own hands, this fine bunch of grapes, that I have\\r\\nreserved for him out of my own share.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Add this fine pine-apple for my share, then,\" said his father, \"and a\\r\\npleasant walk to you, my young friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey proceeded gaily along, and when they reached Naples, as they passed\\r\\nthrough the square where the little merchants held their market,\\r\\nFrancisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo\\'s rule.  He never\\r\\nmissed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their\\r\\nformer kindness to him.  \"That rule,\" said he, \"has been the cause of all\\r\\nmy present happiness, and I thank you for--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never mind thanking him now,\" interrupted Rosetta, \"but look yonder,\\r\\nand tell me what all those people are about.\"  She pointed to a group of\\r\\nmen, women and children, who were assembled under a piazza, listening in\\r\\nvarious attitudes of attention to a man, who was standing upon a flight\\r\\nof steps speaking in a loud voice, and with much action, to the people\\r\\nwho surrounded him.  Francisco, Carlo and Rosetta joined his audience.\\r\\nThe moon shone full upon his countenance, which was very expressive and\\r\\nwhich varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose\\r\\nhistory he was telling, according to all the changes of their fortune.\\r\\nThis man was one of those who are called Improvisatori--persons who, in\\r\\nItalian towns, go about reciting verses or telling stories, which they\\r\\nare supposed to invent as they go on speaking. Some of these people speak\\r\\nwith great fluency, and collect crowds round them in the public streets.\\r\\nWhen an Improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed, and when\\r\\nhe comes to some very interesting part of his narrative, he dexterously\\r\\ndrops his hat upon the ground, and pauses till his auditors have paid\\r\\ntribute to his eloquence.  When he thinks the hat sufficiently full, he\\r\\ntakes it up again, and proceeds with his story.  The hat was dropped just\\r\\nas Francisco and his two friends came under the piazza.  The orator had\\r\\nfinished one story, and was going to commence another.  He fixed his eyes\\r\\nupon Francisco, then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta, and after a moment\\'s\\r\\nconsideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that\\r\\nour young English readers may, perhaps, know by the name of \"Cornaro, or\\r\\nthe Grateful Turk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was deeply interested in this narrative, and when the hat was\\r\\ndropped, he eagerly threw in his contribution.  At the end of the story,\\r\\nwhen the speaker\\'s voice stopped, there was a momentary silence, which\\r\\nwas broken by the orator himself, who exclaimed, as he took up the hat\\r\\nwhich lay at his feet, \"My friends, here is some mistake! this is not my\\r\\nhat; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story.  Pray,\\r\\ngentlemen, find my hat amongst you; it was a remarkably good one, a\\r\\npresent from a nobleman for an epigram I made.  I would not lose my hat\\r\\nfor twice its value.  It has my name written withinside of it, Dominicho,\\r\\nImprovisatore.  Pray, gentlemen, examine your hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody present examined their hats, and showed them to Dominicho, but\\r\\nhis was not amongst them.  No one had left the company; the piazza was\\r\\ncleared, and searched in vain.  \"The hat has vanished by magic,\" said\\r\\nDominicho.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and by the same magic a statue moves,\" cried Carlo, pointing to a\\r\\nfigure standing in a niche, which had hitherto escaped observation.  The\\r\\nface was so much in the shade, that Carlo did not at first perceive that\\r\\nthe statue was Piedro.  Piedro, when he saw himself discovered, burst\\r\\ninto a loud laugh, and throwing down Dominicho\\'s hat, which he held in\\r\\nhis hand behind him, cried, \"A pretty set of novices!  Most excellent\\r\\nplayers at hide-and-seek you would make.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man\\'s hat, or\\r\\nwhether he was, as he said, merely in jest, we leave it to those who know\\r\\nhis general character to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo shook his head.  \"Still at your old tricks, Piedro,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Remember the old proverb:  No fox so cunning but he comes to the\\r\\nfurrier\\'s at last.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I defy the furrier and you, too,\" replied Piedro, taking up his own\\r\\nragged hat.  \"I have no need to steal hats; I can afford to buy better\\r\\nthan you\\'ll have upon your head.  Francisco, a word with you, if you have\\r\\ndone crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so\\r\\nattentively.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what would you say to me?\" said Francisco, following him a few\\r\\nsteps.  \"Do not detain me long, because my friends will wait for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they are friends, they can wait,\" said Piedro.  \"You need not be\\r\\nashamed of being seen in my company now, I can tell you; for I am, as I\\r\\nalways told you I should be, the richest man of the two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rich! you rich?\" cried Francisco.  \"Well, then, it was impossible you\\r\\ncould mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" said Piedro.  Francisco did not consider that those who\\r\\nhave habits of pilfering continue to practise them often, when the\\r\\npoverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases.  \"Impossible!  You\\r\\nstare when I tell you I am rich; but the thing is so.  Moreover, I am\\r\\nwell with my father at home.  I have friends in Naples, and I call myself\\r\\nPiedro the Lucky.  Look you here,\" said he, producing an old gold coin.\\r\\n\"This does not smell of fish, does it?  My father is no longer a\\r\\nfisherman, nor I either.  Neither do I sell sugar-plums to children:  nor\\r\\ndo I slave myself in a vineyard, like some folks; but fortune, when I\\r\\nleast expected it, has stood my friend.  I have many pieces of gold like\\r\\nthis.  Digging in my father\\'s garden, it was my luck to come to an old\\r\\nRoman vessel full of gold.  I have this day agreed for a house in Naples\\r\\nfor my father.  We shall live, whilst we can afford it, like great folks,\\r\\nyou will see; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my\\r\\nold friends, the little Neapolitan merchants, who will change their note\\r\\nwhen they see my change of fortune.  What say you to all this, Francisco\\r\\nthe Honest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I wish you joy of your prosperity, and hope you may enjoy it long\\r\\nand well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, no doubt of that.  Everyone who has it enjoys it WELL.  He always\\r\\ndances well to whom fortune pipes.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, no longer pipe, no longer dance,\" replied Francisco; and here they\\r\\nparted; for Piedro walked away abruptly, much mortified to perceive that\\r\\nhis prosperity did not excite much envy, or command any additional\\r\\nrespect from Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would rather,\" said Francisco, when he returned to Carlo and Rosetta,\\r\\nwho waited for him under the portico, where he left them--\"I would rather\\r\\nhave such good friends as you, Carlo and Arthur, and some more I could\\r\\nname, and, besides that, have a clear conscience, and work honestly for\\r\\nmy bread, than be as lucky as Piedro.  Do you know he has found a\\r\\ntreasure, he says, in his father\\'s garden--a vase full of gold?  He\\r\\nshowed me one of the gold pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much good may they do him.  I hope he came honestly by them,\" said\\r\\nCarlo; \"but ever since the affair of the double measure, I suspect\\r\\ndouble-dealing always from him.  It is not our affair, however.  Let him\\r\\nmake himself happy his way, and we ours.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He that would live in peace and rest,\\r\\n      Must hear, and see, and say the best.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Odi, vedi, taci, se vuoi viver in pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Piedro\\'s neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim; for when he\\r\\nand his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the\\r\\ngarden, the village of Resina did not give them implicit faith.  People\\r\\nnodded and whispered, and shrugged their shoulders; then crossed\\r\\nthemselves, and declared that they would not, for all the riches of\\r\\nNaples, change places with either Piedro or his father.  Regardless, or\\r\\npretending to be regardless, of these suspicions, Piedro and his father\\r\\npersisted in their assertions.  The fishing-nets were sold, and\\r\\neverything in their cottage was disposed of; they left Resina, went to\\r\\nlive at Naples, and, after a few weeks, the matter began to be almost\\r\\nforgotten in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gardener, Francisco\\'s father, was one of those who endeavoured to\\r\\nTHINK THE BEST; and all that he said upon the subject was, that he would\\r\\nnot exchange Francisco the Honest for Piedro the Lucky; that one can\\'t\\r\\njudge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* La vita il fine,--e di loda la sera.\\r\\n\"Compute the morn and evening of their day.\"--Pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to leave our readers longer in suspense, we must inform them that the\\r\\npeasants of Resina were right in their suspicions.  Piedro had never\\r\\nfound any treasure in his father\\'s garden, but he came by his gold in the\\r\\nfollowing manner:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he was banished from the little wood-market for stealing Rosetta\\'s\\r\\nbasketful of wood, after he had cheated the poor woman, who let glasses\\r\\nout to hire, out of the value of the glasses which he broke, and, in\\r\\nshort, after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him, he\\r\\nroamed about the streets of Naples, reckless of what became of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found the truth of the proverb, \"that credit lost is like a Venice\\r\\nglass broken--it can\\'t be mended again.\"  The few shillings which he had\\r\\nin his pocket supplied him with food for a few days.  At last he was glad\\r\\nto be employed by one of the peasants who came to Naples to load their\\r\\nasses with manure out of the streets.  They often follow very early in\\r\\nthe morning, or during the night-time, the trace of carriages that are\\r\\ngone, or that are returning from the opera; and Piedro was one night at\\r\\nthis work, when the horses of a nobleman\\'s carriage took fright at the\\r\\nsudden blaze of some fireworks.  The carriage was overturned near him; a\\r\\nlady was taken out of it, and was hurried by her attendants into a shop,\\r\\nwhere she stayed till her carriage was set to rights.  She was too much\\r\\nalarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of\\r\\nanything; but after some time, she perceived that she had lost a valuable\\r\\ndiamond cross, which she had worn that night at the opera.  She was\\r\\nuncertain where she had dropped it; the shop, the carriage, the street,\\r\\nwere searched for it in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage, seized\\r\\nupon it, and carried it off.  Ignorant as he was of the full value of\\r\\nwhat he had stolen, he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point,\\r\\nwithout trusting someone with the secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some hesitation, he determined to apply to a Jew, who, as it was\\r\\nwhispered, was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale,\\r\\nwithout making any TROUBLESOME inquiries.  It was late; he waited till\\r\\nthe streets were cleared, and then knocked softly at the back door of the\\r\\nJew\\'s house.  The person who opened the door for Piedro was his own\\r\\nfather.  Piedro started back; but his father had fast hold of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What brings you here?\" said the father, in a low voice, a voice which\\r\\nexpressed fear and rage mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only to ask my way--my shortest way,\" stammered Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No equivocations!  Tell me what brings you here at this time of the\\r\\nnight?  I WILL know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, who felt himself in his father\\'s grasp, and who knew that his\\r\\nfather would certainly search him, to find out what he had brought to\\r\\nsell, thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross.  His father\\r\\ncould but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp, which hung over\\r\\ntheir heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would have been duped, if you had gone to sell this to the Jew.  It\\r\\nis well it has fallen into my hands.  How came you by it?\"  Piedro\\r\\nanswered that he had found it in the street.  \"Go your ways home, then,\"\\r\\nsaid his father; \"it is safe with me.  Concern yourself no more about\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty, and he now thought\\r\\nproper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross.\\r\\nHe now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady, whose\\r\\ncarriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera, and he\\r\\nconcluded by saying that, if his father took his prize from him without\\r\\ngiving him his share of the profits, he would go directly to the shop\\r\\nwhere the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage, and\\r\\nthat he would give notice of his having found the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s father saw that his SMART son, though scarcely sixteen years of\\r\\nage, was a match for him in villainy.  He promised him that he should\\r\\nhave half of whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds, and Piedro\\r\\ninsisted upon being present at the transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity.  It\\r\\nis sufficient to say that the Jew, who was a man old in all the arts of\\r\\nvillainy, contrived to cheat both his associates, and obtained the\\r\\ndiamond cross for less than half its value.  The matter was managed so\\r\\nthat the transaction remained undiscovered.  The lady who lost the cross,\\r\\nafter making fruitless inquiries, gave up the search, and Piedro and his\\r\\nfather rejoiced in the success of their manoeuvres.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said, that \"Ill gotten wealth is quickly spent\"; * and so it proved\\r\\nin this instance.  Both father and son lived a riotous life as long as\\r\\ntheir money lasted, and it did not last many months.  What his bad\\r\\neducation began, bad company finished, and Piedro\\'s mind was completely\\r\\nruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he\\r\\ncalled his PROSPERITY.  When his money was at an end, these unprincipled\\r\\nfriends began to look cold upon him, and at last plainly told him--\"If\\r\\nyou mean to LIVE WITH US, you must LIVE AS WE DO.\"  They lived by\\r\\nrobbery.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Vien presto consumato l\\'ingiustamente acquistato.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, though familiarized to the idea of fraud, was shocked at the\\r\\nthought of becoming a robber by profession.  How difficult it is to stop\\r\\nin the career of vice!  Whether Piedro had power to stop, or whether he\\r\\nwas hurried on by his associates, we shall, for the present, leave in\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nWe turn with pleasure from Piedro the Cunning to Francisco the Honest.\\r\\nFrancisco continued the happy and useful course of his life.  By his\\r\\nunremitting perseverance, he improved himself rapidly under the\\r\\ninstructions of his master and friend, Signor Camillo; his friend, we\\r\\nsay, for the fair and open character of Francisco won, or rather earned,\\r\\nthe friendship of this benevolent artist.  The English gentleman seemed\\r\\nto take a pride in our hero\\'s success and good conduct.  He was not one\\r\\nof those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have\\r\\ngiven five guineas.  His servant Arthur always considered every generous\\r\\naction of his master\\'s as his own, and was particularly pleased whenever\\r\\nthis generosity was directed towards Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Carlo and the little Rosetta, they were the companions of all the\\r\\npleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the cool of the evening,\\r\\nafter he had been shut up all day at his work.  And the old carpenter,\\r\\ndelighted with the gratitude of his pupil, frequently repeated--\"that he\\r\\nwas proud to have given the first instructions to such a GENIUS; and that\\r\\nhe had always prophesied Francisco would be a GREAT man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a good man, papa,\" said Rosetta; \"for though he has grown so great,\\r\\nand though he goes into palaces now, to say nothing of that place\\r\\nunderground, where he has leave to go, yet, notwithstanding all this, he\\r\\nnever forgets my brother Carlo and you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the way to have good friends,\" said the carpenter.  \"And I like\\r\\nhis way; he does more than he says.  Facts are masculine, and words are\\r\\nfeminine.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* I fatti sono maschii, le parole femmine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than Piedro could be\\r\\nmade by his stolen diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an\\r\\nancient temple, amongst the ruins of Herculaneum.  He had just reached\\r\\nthe pit, and the men were about to let him down with cords, in the usual\\r\\nmanner, when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding\\r\\nwoman\\'s voice.  He looked, and saw at some paces distant this female\\r\\nfury, who stood guarding the windlass of a well, to which, with\\r\\nthreatening gestures and most voluble menaces, she forbade all access.\\r\\nThe peasants--men, women and children, who had come with their pitchers\\r\\nto draw water at this well--were held at bay by the enraged female.  Not\\r\\none dared to be the first to advance; whilst she grasped with one hand\\r\\nthe handle of the windlass, and, with the other tanned muscular arm\\r\\nextended, governed the populace, bidding them remember that she was\\r\\npadrona, or mistress of the well.  They retired, in hopes of finding a\\r\\nmore gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood; and the\\r\\nfury, when they were out of sight, divided the long black hair which hung\\r\\nover her face, and, turning to one of the spectators, appealed to them in\\r\\na sober voice, and asked if she was not right in what she had done?  \"I,\\r\\nthat am padrona of the well,\" said she, addressing herself to Francisco,\\r\\nwho, with great attention, was contemplating her with the eye of a\\r\\npainter--\"I, that am padrona of the well, must in times of scarcity do\\r\\nstrict justice, and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well.\\r\\nThere is scarcely enough even for ourselves.  I have been obliged to make\\r\\nmy husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past.  If things go\\r\\non at this rate, there will soon be not one drop of water left in my\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood,\" added one of the workmen,\\r\\nwho was standing by; and he mentioned several in which the water had\\r\\nlately suddenly decreased; and a miller affirmed that his mill had\\r\\nstopped for want of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was struck by these remarks.  They brought to his recollection\\r\\nsimilar facts, which he had often heard his father mention in his\\r\\nchildhood, as having been observed previous to the last eruption of Mount\\r\\nVesuvius. *  He had also heard from his father, in his childhood, that it\\r\\nis better to trust to prudence than to fortune; and therefore, though the\\r\\npeasants and workmen, to whom he mentioned his fears, laughed, and said,\\r\\n\"That as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many\\r\\nyears, they would trust to it and St.  Januarius one day longer,\" yet\\r\\nFrancisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst\\r\\nthe ruins of Herculaneum.  After having inquired sufficiently, after\\r\\nhaving seen several wells, in which the water had evidently decreased,\\r\\nand after having seen the mill-wheels that were standing still for want\\r\\nof their usual supply, he hastened home to his father and mother,\\r\\nreported what he had heard and seen, and begged of them to remove, and to\\r\\ntake what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous\\r\\nspot where they now resided.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Phil. Trans. vol. ix.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the inhabitants of Resina, whom he questioned, declared that they\\r\\nhad heard strange rumbling noises underground; and a peasant and his son,\\r\\nwho had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard, a little above the\\r\\nvillage, related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of\\r\\nthe earth, close to them; and that they had, at the same time, heard a\\r\\nnoise like the going off of a pistol. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* These facts are mentioned in Sir William Hamilton\\'s account of an\\r\\neruption of Mount Vesuvius.--See Phil. Trans. 1795, first part.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations;\\r\\nyet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon, or\\r\\nsuch the security in their own good fortune, that few of them would\\r\\nbelieve that there could be any necessity for removing.--\"We\\'ll see what\\r\\nwill happen to-morrow; we shall be safe here one day longer,\" said they.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s father and mother, more prudent than the generality of their\\r\\nneighbours, went to the house of a relation, at some miles\\' distance from\\r\\nVesuvius, and carried with them all their effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Francisco went to the villa where his English friends\\r\\nresided.  The villa was in a most dangerous situation, near Terre del\\r\\nGreco--a town that stands at the foot of Mount Vesuvius.  He related all\\r\\nthe facts that he had heard to Arthur, who, not having been, like the\\r\\ninhabitants of Resina, familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity\\r\\nof a burning mountain, and habituated to trust in St. Januarius, was\\r\\nsufficiently alarmed by Francisco\\'s representations.  He ran to his\\r\\nmaster\\'s apartment, and communicated all that he had just heard.  The\\r\\nCount de Flora and his lady, who were at this time in the house,\\r\\nridiculed the fears of Arthur, and could not be prevailed upon to remove\\r\\neven as far as Naples.  The lady was intent upon preparations for her\\r\\nbirthday, which was to be celebrated in a few days with great\\r\\nmagnificence at their villa; and she observed that it would be a pity to\\r\\nreturn to town before that day, and they had everything arranged for the\\r\\nfestival.  The prudent Englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be\\r\\nconvinced by these arguments, and he left the place of danger.  He left\\r\\nit not too soon, for the next morning exhibited a scene--a scene which we\\r\\nshall not attempt to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of\\r\\nMount Vesuvius, published by Sir W. Hamilton in the \"Philosophical\\r\\nTransactions.\"  It is sufficient here to say that, in the space of about\\r\\nfive hours, the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town\\r\\nutterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the\\r\\nmountain.  The villa of Count de Flora, with some others, which were at a\\r\\nlittle distance from the town, escaped; but they were absolutely\\r\\nsurrounded by the lava.  The count and countess were obliged to fly from\\r\\ntheir house with the utmost precipitation in the night-time; and they had\\r\\nnot time to remove any of their furniture, their plate, clothes, or\\r\\njewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after the eruption, the surface of the lava became so cool\\r\\nthat people could walk upon it, though several feet beneath the surface\\r\\nit was still exceedingly hot.  Numbers of those who had been forced from\\r\\ntheir houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they\\r\\ncould.  But these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had\\r\\nbeen pillaged by robbers, who, in these moments of general confusion,\\r\\nenrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow-creatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has the count abandoned his villa? and is there no one to take care of\\r\\nhis plate and furniture?  The house will certainly be ransacked before\\r\\nmorning,\" said the old carpenter to Francisco, who was at his house\\r\\ngiving him an account of their flight.  Francisco immediately went to the\\r\\ncount\\'s house in warn him of his danger.  The first person he saw was\\r\\nArthur, who, with a face of terror, said to him, \"Do you know what has\\r\\nhappened?  It is all over with Resina!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All over with Resina!  What, has there been a fresh eruption?  Has the\\r\\nlava reached Resina?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it will inevitably be blown up.  There,\" said Arthur, pointing\\r\\nto a thin figure of an Italian, who stood pale and trembling, and looking\\r\\nup to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly.  \"There,\" said Arthur, \"is\\r\\na man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks, with I\\r\\ndon\\'t know how much gunpowder, in the count\\'s house, from which we have\\r\\njust fled.  The wind blows that way.  One spark of fire, and the whole is\\r\\nblown up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco waited not to hear more; but instantly, without explaining his\\r\\nintentions to anyone, set out for the count\\'s villa, and, with a bucket\\r\\nof water in his hand, crossed the beds of lava with which the house was\\r\\nencompassed; when, reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were\\r\\nleft, he plunged them into the water, and returned with them in safety\\r\\nover the lava, yet warm under his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the surprise and joy of the poor firework-maker when he saw\\r\\nFrancisco return from this dangerous expedition!  He could scarcely\\r\\nbelieve his eyes, when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe count, who had given up the hopes of saving his palace, was in\\r\\nadmiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity, which properly\\r\\nsaved not only his villa, but the whole village of Resina, from\\r\\ndestruction.  These fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of\\r\\nthe countess\\' birthday, and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on\\r\\nwhich the inhabitants fled from Torre del Greco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brave young man!\" said the count to Francisco, \"I thank you, and shall\\r\\nnot limit my gratitude to thanks.  You tell me that there is danger of my\\r\\nvilla being pillaged by robbers.  It is from this moment your interest,\\r\\nas well as mine, to prevent their depredations; for (trust to my\\r\\nliberality) a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bravo! bravissimo!\" exclaimed one, who started from a recessed window in\\r\\nthe hall where all this passed.  \"Bravo! bravissimo!\"--Francisco thought\\r\\nhe knew the voice and the countenance of this man, who exclaimed with so\\r\\nmuch enthusiasm.  He remembered to have seen him before, but when, or\\r\\nwhere, he could not recollect.  As soon as the count left the hall, the\\r\\nstranger came up to Francisco.  \"Is it possible,\" said he, \"that you\\r\\ndon\\'t know me?  It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your\\r\\neyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tears from my eyes?\" repeated Francisco, smiling; \"I have shed but few\\r\\ntears.  I have had but few misfortunes in my life.\"  The stranger\\r\\nanswered him by two extempore Italian lines, which conveyed nearly the\\r\\nsame idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To each their sufferings--all are men\\r\\n         Condemn\\'d alike to groan;\\r\\n      The feeling for another\\'s woes,\\r\\n         Th\\' unfeeling for his own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you now perfectly well,\" cried Francisco; \"you are the\\r\\nImprovisatore who, one fine moonlight night last summer, told us the\\r\\nstory of Cornaro the Turk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same,\" said the Improvisatore; \"the same, though in a better dress,\\r\\nwhich I should not have thought would have made so much difference in\\r\\nyour eyes, though it makes all the difference between man and man in the\\r\\neyes of the stupid vulgar.  My genius has broken through the clouds of\\r\\nmisfortune of late.  A few happy impromptu verses I made on the Count de\\r\\nFlora\\'s fall from his horse attracted attention.  The count patronizes\\r\\nme.  I am here now to learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for\\r\\nhis lady\\'s birthday.  My ode was to have been set to music, and to have\\r\\nbeen performed at his villa near Torre del Greco, if these troubles had\\r\\nnot intervened.  Now that the mountain is quiet again, people will return\\r\\nto their senses.  I expect to be munificently rewarded.  But, perhaps, I\\r\\ndetain you.  Go; I shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you\\r\\nhave performed this day.  I still amuse myself amongst the populace in my\\r\\ntattered garb late in the evenings, and I shall sound your praises\\r\\nthrough Naples in a poem I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount\\r\\nVesuvius.  Adieu.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Improvisatore was as good as his word.  That evening, with more than\\r\\nhis usual enthusiasm, he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in\\r\\none of the public squares.  Amongst the crowd were several to whom the\\r\\nname of Francisco was well known, and by whom he was well beloved.  These\\r\\nwere his young companions, who remembered him as a fruit-seller amongst\\r\\nthe little merchants.  They rejoiced to hear his praises, and repeated\\r\\nthe lines with shouts of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us pass.  What is all this disturbance in the streets?\" said a man,\\r\\npushing his way through the crowd.  A lad who held by his arm stopped\\r\\nsuddenly on hearing the name of Francisco, which the people were\\r\\nrepeating with so much enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!  I have found at last a story that interests you more than that of\\r\\nCornaro the Turk,\" cried the Improvisatore, looking in the face of the\\r\\nyouth, who had stopped so suddenly.  \"You are the young man who, last\\r\\nsummer, had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat.  Promise me you\\r\\nwon\\'t touch it now,\" said he, throwing down the hat at his feet, \"or you\\r\\nhear not one word I have to say.  Not one word of the heroic action\\r\\nperformed at the villa of the Count de Flora, near Torre del Greco, this\\r\\nmorning, by Signor Francisco.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIGNOR Francisco!\" repeated the lad with disdain.  \"Well, let us hear\\r\\nwhat you have to tell of him,\" added he.  \"Your hat is very safe, I\\r\\npromise you; I shall not touch it.  What of SIGNOR Francisco?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIGNOR Francisco I may, without impropriety, call him,\" said the\\r\\nImprovisatore, \"for he is likely to become rich enough to command the\\r\\ntitle from those who might not otherwise respect his merit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Likely to become rich! how?\" said the lad, whom our readers have\\r\\nprobably before this time discovered to be Piedro.  \"How, pray, is he\\r\\nlikely to become rich enough to be a signor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine\\r\\nfurniture, plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del\\r\\nGreco.  Francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count\\'s\\r\\ndomestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous\\r\\nplunderers, who robbed their fellow-creatures of what even the flames of\\r\\nVesuvius would spare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, we have had enough of this stuff,\" cried the man whose arm Piedro\\r\\nheld.  \"Come away,\" and he hurried forwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed\\r\\nsuch indignation.  He was one of those with whom Piedro got acquainted\\r\\nduring the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained\\r\\nby the sale of the stolen diamond cross.  That robbery was not\\r\\ndiscovered; and his success, as he called it, hardened him in guilt.  He\\r\\nwas both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company\\r\\nwith whom his ill gotten wealth connected him.  He did not consider that\\r\\nbad company leads to the gallows. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* La mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was\\r\\nto these villains a time of rejoicing.  No sooner did Piedro\\'s companion\\r\\nhear of the rich furniture, plate, etc., which the imprudent orator had\\r\\ndescribed as belonging to the Count de Flora\\'s villa, than he longed to\\r\\nmake himself master of the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a pity,\" said Piedro, \"that the count has sent Francisco, with his\\r\\nservants down to guard it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is this Francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A boy, a young lad only, of about my own age; but I know him to be\\r\\nsturdily honest.  The servants we might corrupt; but even the old proverb\\r\\nof \\'Angle with a silver hook,\\' * won\\'t hold good with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* Pescar col hamo d\\'argento.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if he cannot be won by fair means, he must be conquered by foul,\"\\r\\nsaid the desperate villain; \"but if we offer him rather more than the\\r\\ncount has already promised for his share of the booty, of course he will\\r\\nconsult at once his safety and his interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Piedro; \"that is not his nature.  I know him from a child, and\\r\\nwe had better think of some other house for to-night\\'s business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None other; none but this,\" cried his companion, with an oath.  \"My mind\\r\\nis determined upon this, and you must obey your leader:  recollect the\\r\\nfate of him who failed me yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been\\r\\nassassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime\\r\\nsuggested by their leader.  No tyranny is so dreadful as that which is\\r\\nexercised by villains over their young accomplices, who become their\\r\\nslaves.  Piedro, who was of a cowardly nature, trembled at the\\r\\nthreatening countenance of his captain, and promised submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the morning, inquiries were made secretly amongst the\\r\\ncount\\'s servants; and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa\\r\\nthat night along with Francisco, were bribed to second the views of this\\r\\ngang of thieves.  It was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be\\r\\nlet into the house; that Francisco should be tied hand and foot, whilst\\r\\nthey carried off their booty.  \"He is a stubborn chap, though so young, I\\r\\nunderstand,\" said the captain of the robbers to his men; \"but we carry\\r\\nponiards, and know how to use them.  Piedro, you look pale.  You don\\'t\\r\\nrequire to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone just\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s voice failed, and some of his comrades observed that he was\\r\\nyoung and new to the business.  The captain, who, from being his\\r\\npretended friend during his wealthy days, had of late become his tyrant,\\r\\ncast a stern look at Piedro, and bid him be sure to be at the old Jew\\'s,\\r\\nwhich was the place of meeting, in the dusk of the evening.  After saying\\r\\nthis he departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, when he was alone, tried to collect his thoughts--all his\\r\\nthoughts were full of horror.  \"Where am I?\" said he to himself; \"what am\\r\\nI about?  Did I understand rightly what he said about poniards?\\r\\nFrancisco; oh, Francisco!  Excellent, kind, generous Francisco!  Yes, I\\r\\nrecollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips, as I\\r\\nsat by the sea-shore deserted by all the world; and now, what friends\\r\\nhave I.  Robbers and--\"  The word MURDERERS he could not utter.  He again\\r\\nrecollected what had been said about poniards, and the longer his mind\\r\\nfixed upon the words, and the look that accompanied them, the more he was\\r\\nshocked.  He could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his\\r\\naccomplices to murder Francisco, if he should make any resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply\\r\\nfor advice or assistance.  His wretched father died some weeks before\\r\\nthis time, in a fit of intoxication.  Piedro walked up and down the\\r\\nstreet, scarcely capable of thinking, much less of coming to any rational\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours passed away, the shadows of the houses lengthened under his\\r\\nfootsteps, the evening came on, and when it grew dusk, after hesitating\\r\\nin great agony of mind for some time, his fear of the robbers\\' vengeance\\r\\nprevailed over every other feeling, and he went at the appointed hour to\\r\\nthe place of meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place of meeting was at the house of that Jew to whom he, several\\r\\nmonths before, sold the diamond cross.  That cross which he thought\\r\\nhimself so lucky to have stolen, and to have disposed of undetected, was,\\r\\nin fact, the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation.  It\\r\\nwas at the Jew\\'s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers, to\\r\\nwhom he was now become an absolute slave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that I dared to disobey!\" said he to himself, with a deep sigh, as\\r\\nhe knocked softly at the back door of the Jew\\'s house.  The back door\\r\\nopened into a narrow, unfrequented street, and some small rooms at this\\r\\nside of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired\\r\\nto have their business kept secret.  These rooms were separated by a dark\\r\\npassage from the rest of the house, and numbers of people came to the\\r\\nshop in the front of the house, which looked into a creditable street,\\r\\nwithout knowing anything more, from the ostensible appearance of the\\r\\nshop, than that it was a kind of pawnbroker\\'s, where old clothes, old\\r\\niron, and all sorts of refuse goods, might be disposed of conveniently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment Piedro knocked at the back door, the front shop was full of\\r\\ncustomers; and the Jew\\'s boy, whose office it was to attend to these\\r\\nsignals, let Piedro in, told him that none of his comrades were yet come,\\r\\nand left him in a room by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was pale and trembling, and felt a cold dew spread over him.  He had a\\r\\nleaden image of Saint Januarius tied round his neck, which, in the midst\\r\\nof his wickedness, he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm, and\\r\\non this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed, as he sat alone in this gloomy\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened from time to time, but he heard no noise at the side of the\\r\\nhouse where he was.  His accomplices did not arrive, and, in a sort of\\r\\nimpatient terror, the attendant upon an evil conscience, he flung open\\r\\nthe door of his cell, and groped his way through the passage which he\\r\\nknew led to the public shop.  He longed to hear some noise, and to mix\\r\\nwith the living.  The Jew, when Piedro entered the shop, was bargaining\\r\\nwith a poor, thin-looking man about some gunpowder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t deny that it has been wet,\" said the man, \"but since it was in\\r\\nthe bucket of water, it has been carefully dried.  I tell you the simple\\r\\ntruth, that so soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the\\r\\npeople of Naples will not relish fireworks.  My poor little rockets, and\\r\\neven my Catherine-wheels, will have no effect.  I am glad to part with\\r\\nall I have in this line of business.  A few days ago I had fine things in\\r\\nreadiness for the Countess de Flora\\'s birthday, which was to have been\\r\\ncelebrated at the count\\'s villa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you fix your eyes on me, friend?  What is your discourse to me?\"\\r\\nsaid Piedro, who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he\\r\\nmentioned the name of the count\\'s villa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that I fixed my eyes upon you; I was thinking of my\\r\\nfireworks,\" said the poor man, simply.  \"But now that I do look at you\\r\\nand hear your voice, I recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When? where?\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great while ago; no wonder you have forgotten me,\" said the man; \"but\\r\\nI can recall the night to your recollection.  You were in the street with\\r\\nme the night I let off that unlucky rocket, which frightened the horses,\\r\\nand was the cause of overturning a lady\\'s coach.  Don\\'t you remember the\\r\\ncircumstance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a confused recollection of some such thing,\" said Piedro, in\\r\\ngreat embarrassment; and he looked suspiciously at this man, in doubt\\r\\nwhether he was cunning, and wanted to sound him, or whether he was so\\r\\nsimple as he appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did not, perhaps, hear, then,\" continued the man, \"that there was a\\r\\ngreat search made, after the overturn, for a fine diamond cross,\\r\\nbelonging to the lady in the carriage?  That lady, though I did not know\\r\\nit till lately, was the Countess de Flora.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing of the matter,\" interrupted Piedro, in great agitation.\\r\\nHis confusion was so marked, that the firework-maker could not avoid\\r\\ntaking notice of it; and a silence of some moments ensued.  The Jew, more\\r\\npractised in dissimulation than Piedro, endeavoured to turn the man\\'s\\r\\nattention back to his rockets and his gunpowder--agreed to take the\\r\\ngunpowder--paid for it in haste, and was, though apparently unconcerned,\\r\\neager to get rid of him.  But this was not so easily done.  The man\\'s\\r\\ncuriosity was excited, and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every\\r\\nmoment by all the dark changes of his countenance.  Piedro, overpowered\\r\\nwith the sense of guilt, surprised at the unexpected mention of the\\r\\ndiamond cross, and of the Count de Flora\\'s villa, stood like one\\r\\nconvicted, and seemed fixed to the spot, without power of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to look at the old cambric that you said you had--that would do\\r\\nfor making--that you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers,\"\\r\\nsaid the firework-maker to the Jew; and as he spoke, his eye from time to\\r\\ntime looked towards Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro felt for the leaden image of the saint, which he wore round his\\r\\nneck.  The string which held it cracked, and broke with the pull he gave\\r\\nit.  This slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious\\r\\nmind more than all the rest.  He imagined that at this moment his fate\\r\\nwas decided; that Saint Januarius deserted him, and that he was undone.\\r\\nHe precipitately followed the firework-man the instant he left the shop,\\r\\nand seizing hold of his arm, whispered, \"I must speak to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak, then,\" said the man, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not here; this way,\" said he, drawing him towards the dark passage:\\r\\n\"what I have to say must not be overheard.  You are going to the Count de\\r\\nFlora\\'s, are not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said the man.  He was going there to speak to the countess about\\r\\nsome artificial flowers; but Piedro thought he was going to speak to her\\r\\nabout the diamond cross.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going to give information against me?  Nay, hear me, I confess\\r\\nthat I purloined that diamond cross; but I can do the count a great\\r\\nservice, upon condition that he pardons me.  His villa is to be attacked\\r\\nthis night by four well armed men.  They will set out five hours hence.\\r\\nI am compelled, under the threat of assassination, to accompany them; but\\r\\nI shall do no more.  I throw myself upon the count\\'s mercy.  Hasten to\\r\\nhim--we have no time to lose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor man, who heard this confession, escaped from Piedro the moment\\r\\nhe loosed his arm.  With all possible expedition he ran to the count\\'s\\r\\npalace in Naples, and related to him all that had been said by Piedro.\\r\\nSome of the count\\'s servants, on whom he could most depend, were at a\\r\\ndistant part of the city attending their mistress, but the English\\r\\ngentleman offered the services of his man Arthur.  Arthur no sooner heard\\r\\nthe business, and understood that Francisco was in danger, than he armed\\r\\nhimself without saying one word, saddled his English horse, and was ready\\r\\nto depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and\\r\\nconjectures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we are not to set out yet,\" said the servant; \"it is but four miles\\r\\nto Torre del Greco; the sbirri (officers of justice) are summoned--they\\r\\nare to go with us--we must wait for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited, much against Arthur\\'s inclination, a considerable time for\\r\\nthese sbirri.  At length they set out, and just as they reached the\\r\\nvilla, the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the\\r\\nhouse.  The robbers were there.  This pistol was snapped by their captain\\r\\nat poor Francisco, who had bravely asserted that he would, as long as he\\r\\nhad life, defend the property committed to his care.  The pistol missed\\r\\nfire, for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the Jew\\r\\nhad bought that evening from the firework maker, and which he had sold as\\r\\nexcellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers--the robbers\\r\\nwho met at his house.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur, as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece, pressed forward\\r\\nthrough all the apartments, followed by the count\\'s servants and the\\r\\nofficers of justice.  At the sudden appearance of so many armed men, the\\r\\nrobbers stood dismayed.  Arthur eagerly shook Francisco\\'s hand,\\r\\ncongratulating him upon his safety, and did not perceive, till he had\\r\\ngiven him several rough friendly shakes, that his arm was wounded, and\\r\\nthat he was pale with the loss of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not much--only a slight wound,\" said Francisco; \"one that I should\\r\\nhave escaped, if I had been upon my guard; but the sight of a face that I\\r\\nlittle expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind;\\r\\nand one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm, whilst I stood in\\r\\nstupid astonishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! take me to prison! take me to prison--I am weary of life--I am a\\r\\nwretch not fit to live!\" cried Piedro, holding his hands to be tied by\\r\\nthe sbirri.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison; and as he passed through\\r\\nthe streets of Naples he was met by several of those who had known him\\r\\nwhen he was a child.  \"Ay,\" said they, as he went by, \"his father\\r\\nencouraged him in cheating when he was BUT A CHILD; and see what he is\\r\\ncome to, now he is a man!\"  He was ordered to remain twelve months in\\r\\nsolitary confinement.  His captain and his accomplices were sent to the\\r\\ngalleys, and the Jew was banished from Naples.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, having got these villains out of the way, let us return to\\r\\nhonest Francisco.  His wound was soon healed.  Arthur was no bad surgeon,\\r\\nfor he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased; and Carlo and\\r\\nRosetta nursed him with so much kindness, that he was almost sorry to\\r\\nfind himself perfectly recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now that you are able to go out,\" said Francisco\\'s father to him, \"you\\r\\nmust come and look at my new house, my dear son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your new house, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, son, and a charming one it is, and a handsome piece of land near\\r\\nit--all at a safe distance, too, from Mount Vesuvius; and can you guess\\r\\nhow I came by it?--it was given to me for having a good son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried Carlo; \"the inhabitants of Resina, and several who had\\r\\nproperty near Terre del Greco, and whose houses and lives were saved by\\r\\nyour intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the\\r\\ngunpowder out of this dangerous place, went in a body to the duke, and\\r\\nrequested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king,\\r\\nwho, amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption\\r\\nof Mount Vesuvius, has been pleased to say that he gives this house and\\r\\ngarden to your father, because you have saved the property and lives of\\r\\nmany of his subjects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of a handsome portion of furniture, plate, etc., in the Count\\r\\nde Flora\\'s villa, was, according to the count\\'s promise, given to him;\\r\\nand this money he divided between his own family and that of the good\\r\\ncarpenter who first put a pencil into his hands.  Arthur would not accept\\r\\nof any present from him.  To Mr. Lee, the English gentleman, he offered\\r\\none of his own drawings--a fruit-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like this very well,\" said Arthur, as he examined the drawing, \"but I\\r\\nshould like this melon better if it was a little bruised.  It is now\\r\\nthree years ago since I was going to buy that bruised melon from you; you\\r\\nshowed me your honest nature then, though you were but a boy; and I have\\r\\nfound you the same ever since.  A good beginning makes a good ending--an\\r\\nhonest boy will make an honest man; and honesty is the best policy, as\\r\\nyou have proved to all who wanted the proof, I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" added Francisco\\'s father, \"I think it is pretty plain that Piedro\\r\\nthe Cunning has not managed quite so well as Francisco the Honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTARLTON.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,--\\r\\n     To teach the young idea how to shoot,--\\r\\n     To pour the fresh instruction o\\'er the mind,--\\r\\n     To breathe th\\' enlivening spirit,--and to fix\\r\\n     The generous purpose in the glowing breast.\\r\\n                                               THOMSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Hardy was educated by Mr. Freeman, a very excellent master, at one\\r\\nof our rural Sunday schools.  He was honest, obedient, active and good-\\r\\nnatured, hence he was esteemed by his master; and being beloved by all\\r\\nhis companions who were good, he did not desire to be loved by the bad;\\r\\nnor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle, mischievous or dishonest\\r\\nboys attempted to plague or ridicule him.  His friend Loveit, on the\\r\\ncontrary, wished to be universally liked, and his highest ambition was to\\r\\nbe thought the best natured boy in the school--and so he was.  He usually\\r\\nwent by the name of POOR LOVEIT, and everybody pitied him when he got\\r\\ninto disgrace, which he frequently did, for though he had a good\\r\\ndisposition, he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely\\r\\nbecause he could never have the courage to say \"NO,\" because he was\\r\\nafraid to offend the ill-natured, and could not bear to be laughed at by\\r\\nfools.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine autumn evening, all the boys were permitted to go out to play in\\r\\na pleasant green meadow near the school.  Loveit and another boy, called\\r\\nTarlton, began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock, and a large\\r\\nparty stood by to look on, for they were the best players at battledore\\r\\nand shuttlecock in the school, and this was a trial of skill between\\r\\nthem.  When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty, the game\\r\\nbecame very interesting.  The arms of the combatants tired that they\\r\\ncould scarcely wield the battledores.  The shuttlecock began to waver in\\r\\nthe air; now it almost touched the ground, and now, to the astonishment\\r\\nof the spectators, mounted again high over their heads:  yet the strokes\\r\\nbecame feebler and feebler; and \"Now, Loveit!\" \"Now, Tarlton!\" resounded\\r\\non all sides.  For another minute the victory was doubtful; but at length\\r\\nthe setting sun, shining full in Loveit\\'s face, so dazzled his eyes that\\r\\nhe could no longer see the shuttlecock, and it fell at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first shout for Tarlton\\'s triumph was over, everybody\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Poor Loveit! he\\'s the best natured fellow in the world!  What\\r\\na pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, I dare you all to play another game with me,\" cried Tarlton,\\r\\nvauntingly; and as he spoke, he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his\\r\\nforce--with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a\\r\\nlane, which went close beside the field.  \"Hey-day!\" said Tarlton, \"what\\r\\nshall we do now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane; and it was upon\\r\\ntheir promise not to break this command, that they were allowed to play\\r\\nin the adjoining field.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped.  They\\r\\nstood on the top of the bank, peeping over the hedge.  \"I see it yonder,\"\\r\\nsaid Tarlton; \"I wish somebody would get it.  One could get over the gate\\r\\nat the bottom of the field, and be back again in half a minute,\" added\\r\\nhe, looking at Loveit.  \"But you know we must not go into the lane,\" said\\r\\nLoveit, hesitatingly.  \"Pugh!\" said Tarlton, \"why, now, what harm could\\r\\nit do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Loveit, drumming upon his battledore; \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know, man! why, then, what are you afraid of, I ask you?\"\\r\\nLoveit coloured, went on drumming, and again, in a lower voice, said \"HE\\r\\nDIDN\\'T KNOW.\"  But upon Tarlton\\'s repeating, in a more insolent tone, \"I\\r\\nask you, man, what you\\'re afraid of?\" he suddenly left off drumming, and\\r\\nlooking round, said, \"he was not afraid of anything that he knew of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you are,\" said Hardy, coming forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I?\" said Loveit; \"of what, pray, am I afraid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of doing wrong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Afraid OF DOING WRONG!\" repeated Tarlton, mimicking him, so that he made\\r\\neverybody laugh.  \"Now, hadn\\'t you better say afraid of being flogged?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hardy, coolly, after the laugh had somewhat subsided, \"I am as\\r\\nlittle afraid of being flogged as you are, Tarlton; but I meant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter what you meant; why should you interfere with your wisdom and\\r\\nyour meanings; nobody thought of asking YOU to stir a step for us; but we\\r\\nasked Loveit, because he\\'s the best fellow in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And for that very reason you should not ask him, because, you know he\\r\\ncan\\'t refuse you anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, though,\" cried Loveit, piqued, \"THERE you\\'re mistaken, for I\\r\\ncould refuse if I chose it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy smiled; and Loveit, half afraid of his contempt, and half afraid of\\r\\nTarlton\\'s ridicule, stood doubtful, and again had recourse to his\\r\\nbattledore, which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger.  \"Look\\r\\nat him!--now do look at him!\" cried Tarlton; \"did you ever in your life\\r\\nsee anybody look so silly?--Hardy has him quite under his thumb; he\\'s so\\r\\nmortally afraid of Parson Prig, that he dare not, for the soul of him,\\r\\nturn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose; look how he squints!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t squint,\" said Loveit, looking up, \"and nobody has me under his\\r\\nthumb! and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace;\\r\\nhe\\'s the best friend I have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit spoke this with more than usual spirit, for both his heart and his\\r\\npride were touched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come along, then,\" said Hardy, taking him by the arm in an affectionate\\r\\nmanner; and he was just going, when Tarlton called after him, \"Ay, go\\r\\nalong with its best friend, and take care it does not get into a scrape;-\\r\\n-good-bye, Little Panado!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whom do they call Little Panado?\" said Loveit, turning his head hastily\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind,\" said Hardy, \"what does it signify?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Loveit, \"to be sure it does not signify; but one does not like\\r\\nto be called Little Panado:  besides,\" added he, after going a few steps\\r\\nfarther, \"they\\'ll all think it so ill-natured.  I had better go back, and\\r\\njust tell them that I\\'m very sorry I can\\'t get their shuttlecock; do come\\r\\nback with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hardy, \"I can\\'t go back; and you\\'d better not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, I assure you, I won\\'t stay a minute; wait for me,\" added Loveit;\\r\\nand he slunk back again to prove that he was not Little Panado.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce returned, the rest followed, of course; for to support his character\\r\\nof good-nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his\\r\\ncompanions, and to show his spirit, leapt over the gate, amidst the\\r\\nacclamations of the little mob:--he was quickly out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" cried he, returning in about five minutes, quite out of breath,\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got the shuttlecock; and I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ve seen,\" cried he,\\r\\npanting for breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried everybody, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, just at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane\"--panting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Tarlton, impatiently, \"do go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me just take breath first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pugh--never mind your breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, just at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane, as I\\r\\nwas looking about for the shuttlecock, I heard a great rustling somewhere\\r\\nnear me, and so I looked where it could come from; and I saw, in a nice\\r\\nlittle garden, on the opposite side of the way, a boy, about as big as\\r\\nTarlton, sitting in a great tree, shaking the branches:  so I called to\\r\\nthe boy, to beg one; but he said he could not give me one, for that they\\r\\nwere his grandfather\\'s; and just at that minute, from behind a gooseberry\\r\\nbush, up popped the uncle; the grandfather poked his head out of the\\r\\nwindow; so I ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though I heard him\\r\\nbawling after me all the way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And let him bawl,\" cried Tarlton; \"he shan\\'t bawl for nothing; I\\'m\\r\\ndetermined we\\'ll have some of his fine large rosy apples before I sleep\\r\\nto-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this speech a general silence ensued; everybody kept their eyes fixed\\r\\nupon Tarlton, except Loveit, who looked down, apprehensive that he should\\r\\nbe drawn on much farther than he intended.  \"Oh, indeed!\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"as Hardy told me, I had better not have come back!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of this confusion, Tarlton continued, \"But before I say any\\r\\nmore, I hope we have no spies amongst us.  If there is any one of you\\r\\nafraid to be flogged, let him march off this instant!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit coloured, bit his lips, wished to go, but had not the courage to\\r\\nmove first.  He waited to see what everybody else would do:  nobody\\r\\nstirred; so Loveit stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" cried Tarlton, giving his hand to the boy next him, then to\\r\\nthe next, \"your word and honour that you won\\'t betray me; but stand by\\r\\nme, and I\\'ll stand by you.\"  Each boy gave his hand and his promise;\\r\\nrepeating, \"Stand by me, and I\\'ll stand by you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit hung back till the last; and had almost twisted off the button of\\r\\nthe boy\\'s coat who screened him, when Tarlton came up, holding out his\\r\\nhand, \"Come, Loveit, lad, you\\'re in for it:  stand by me, and I\\'ll stand\\r\\nby you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Tarlton,\" expostulated he, without looking him in the face, \"I\\r\\ndo wish you\\'d give up this scheme; I daresay all the apples are gone by\\r\\nthis time; I wish you would.  Do, pray, give up this scheme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What scheme, man? you have\\'n\\'t heard it yet; you may as well know your\\r\\ntext before you begin preaching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corners of Loveit\\'s mouth could not refuse to smile, though in his\\r\\nheart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I don\\'t know you, I declare I don\\'t know you to-day,\" said Tarlton;\\r\\n\"you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world, and\\r\\nwould do anything one asked you; but you\\'re quite altered of late, as we\\r\\nwere saying just now, when you skulked away with Hardy:  come,--do, man,\\r\\npluck up a little spirit, and be one of us, or you\\'ll make us all HATE\\r\\nYOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HATE me!\" repeated Loveit, with terror; \"no, surely, you won\\'t all HATE\\r\\nme!\" and he mechanically stretched out his hand which Tarlton shook\\r\\nviolently, saying, \"Ay, now, that\\'s right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, now, that\\'s wrong!\" whispered Loveit\\'s conscience; but his\\r\\nconscience was of no use to him, for it was always overpowered by the\\r\\nvoice of numbers; and though he had the wish, he never had the power, to\\r\\ndo right.  \"Poor Loveit!  I knew he would not refuse us,\" cried his\\r\\ncompanions; and even Tarlton, the moment he shook hands with him,\\r\\ndespised him.  It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by\\r\\nthe good and the bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league being thus formed, Tarlton assumed all the airs of commander,\\r\\nexplained his schemes, and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old\\r\\nman\\'s apple-tree.  It was the only one he had the world.  We shall not\\r\\ndwell upon their consultation; for the amusement of contriving such\\r\\nexpeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small window at the end of the back staircase, through which,\\r\\nbetween nine and ten o\\'clock at night, Tarlton, accompanied by Loveit and\\r\\nanother boy, crept out.  It was a moonlight night, and after crossing the\\r\\nfield, and climbing the gate, directed by Loveit, who now resolved to go\\r\\nthrough the affair with spirit, they proceeded down the lane with rash\\r\\nyet fearful steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance Loveit saw the white washed cottage, and the apple-tree\\r\\nbeside it.  They quickened their pace, and with some difficulty scrambled\\r\\nthrough the hedge which fenced the garden, though not without being\\r\\nscratched and torn by the briers.  Everything was silent.  Yet now and\\r\\nthen, at every rustling of the leaves, they started, and their hearts\\r\\nbeat violently.  Once, as Loveit was climbing the apple-tree, he thought\\r\\nhe heard a door in the cottage open, and earnestly begged his companions\\r\\nto desist and return home.  This, however, he could by no means persuade\\r\\nthem to do, until they had filled their pockets with apples; then, to his\\r\\ngreat joy, they returned, crept in at the window and each retired, as\\r\\nsoftly as possible, to his own apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit slept in the room with Hardy, whom he had left fast asleep, and\\r\\nwhom he now was extremely afraid of awakening.  All the apples were\\r\\nemptied out of Loveit\\'s pockets, and lodged with Tarlton till the\\r\\nmorning, for fear the smell should betray the secret to Hardy.  The room\\r\\ndoor was apt to creak, but it was opened with such precaution, that no\\r\\nnoise could be heard, and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when\\r\\nhe left him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said he to himself, \"how quietly he sleeps!  I wish I had been\\r\\nsleeping too.\"  The reproaches of Loveit\\'s conscience, however, served no\\r\\nother purpose but to torment him; he had not sufficient strength of mind\\r\\nto be good.  The very next night, in spite of all his fears, and all his\\r\\npenitence, and all his resolutions, by a little fresh ridicule and\\r\\npersuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar\\r\\nexpedition.  We must observe, that the necessity for continuing their\\r\\ndepredations became stronger the third day; for, though at first only a\\r\\nsmall party had been in the secret, by degrees it was divulged to the\\r\\nwhole school; and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the\\r\\nbooty.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone was astonished that Hardy, with all his quickness and\\r\\npenetration, had not yet discovered their proceedings; but Loveit could\\r\\nnot help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to\\r\\nbe.  Loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy; but he was by no\\r\\nmeans an artful boy; and in talking to his friend, conscious that he had\\r\\nsomething to conceal, he was perpetually on the point of betraying\\r\\nhimself; then recollecting his engagement, he blushed, stammered,\\r\\nbungled; and upon Hardy\\'s asking what he meant, would answer with a\\r\\nsilly, guilty countenance, that he did not know; or abruptly break off,\\r\\nsaying, \"Oh nothing! nothing at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend.\\r\\nA gloom overspread Tarlton\\'s brow when he began to speak on the subject,\\r\\nand he always returned a peremptory refusal, accompanied with some such\\r\\ntaunting expression as this--\"I wish we had nothing to do with such a\\r\\nsneaking fellow; he\\'ll betray us all, I see, before we have done with\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Loveit to himself, \"so I am abused after all, and called a\\r\\nsneaking fellow for my pains; that\\'s rather hard, to be sure, when I\\'ve\\r\\ngot so little by the job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth he had not got much; for in the division of the booty only one\\r\\napple, and half of another, which was only half ripe, happened to fall to\\r\\nhis share; though, to be sure, when they had all eaten their apples, he\\r\\nhad the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they\\r\\nhad forgotten to offer some of theirs to \"POOR LOVEIT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, the visits to the apple-tree had been now too frequently\\r\\nrepeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage.\\r\\nHe used to examine his only tree very frequently, and missing numbers of\\r\\nrosy apples, which he had watched ripening, he, though not prone to\\r\\nsuspicion, began to think that there was something going wrong;\\r\\nespecially as a gap was made in his hedge, and there were several small\\r\\nfootsteps in his flower beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living\\r\\ncreature, much less to children, of whom he was particularly fond.  Nor\\r\\nwas he in the least avaricious, for though he was not rich, he had enough\\r\\nto live upon, because he had been very industrious in his youth; and he\\r\\nwas always very ready to part with the little he had.  Nor was he a cross\\r\\nold man.  If anything would have made him angry, it would have been the\\r\\nseeing his favourite tree robbed, as he had promised himself the pleasure\\r\\nof giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday.  However,\\r\\nhe looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger, and leaning upon\\r\\nhis staff, he began to consider what he had best do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I complain to their master,\" said he to himself, \"they will certainly\\r\\nbe flogged, and that I should be sorry for:  yet they must not be let to\\r\\ngo on stealing; that would be worse still, for it would surely bring them\\r\\nto the gallows in the end.  Let me see--oh, ay, that will do; I will\\r\\nborrow farmer Kent\\'s dog Barker, he\\'ll keep them off, I\\'ll answer for\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Kent lent his dog Barker, cautioning his neighbour, at the same\\r\\ntime, to be sure to chain him well, for he was the fiercest mastiff in\\r\\nEngland.  The old man, with farmer Kent\\'s assistance, chained him fast to\\r\\nthe trunk of the apple-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight came; and Tarlton, Loveit and his companions, returned at the usual\\r\\nhour.  Grown bolder now by frequent success, they came on talking and\\r\\nlaughing.  But the moment they had set their foot in the garden, the dog\\r\\nstarted up; and, shaking the chain as he sprang forward, barked with\\r\\nunremitting fury.  They stood still as if fixed to the spot.  There was\\r\\njust moonlight enough to see the dog.  \"Let us try the other side of the\\r\\ntree,\" said Tarlton.  But to whichever side they turned, the dog flew\\r\\nround in an instant, barking with increased fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll break his chain and tear us to pieces,\" cried Tarlton; and, struck\\r\\nwith terror, he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with\\r\\nhim, and betook himself to flight, with the greatest precipitation.\\r\\n\"Help me! oh, pray, help me!  I can\\'t get through the hedge,\" cried\\r\\nLoveit, in a lamentable tone, whilst the dog growled hideously, and\\r\\nsprang forward to the extremity of his chain.  \"I can\\'t get out!  Oh, for\\r\\nGod\\'s sake, stay for me one minute, dear Tarlton!\"  He called in vain; he\\r\\nwas left to struggle through his difficulties by himself; and of all his\\r\\ndear friends not one turned back to help him.  At last, torn and\\r\\nterrified, he got through the hedge and ran home, despising his\\r\\ncompanions for their selfishness.  Nor could he help observing that\\r\\nTarlton, with all his vaunted prowess, was the first to run away from the\\r\\nappearance of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their\\r\\nconduct.  \"Why could not you, any of you, stay one minute to help me?\"\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We did not hear you call,\" answered one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was so frightened,\" said another, \"I would not have turned back for\\r\\nthe whole world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Tarlton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I,\" said Tarlton; \"had not I enough to do to take care of myself, you\\r\\nblockhead?  Everyone for himself in this world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I see,\" said Loveit, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, man! is there anything strange in that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange! why, yes; I thought you all loved me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord love you, lad! so we do; but we love ourselves better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardy would not have served me so, however,\" said Loveit, turning away\\r\\nin disgust.  Tarlton was alarmed.  \"Pugh!\" said he; \"what nonsense have\\r\\nyou taken into your brain!  Think no more about it.  We are all very\\r\\nsorry, and beg your pardon; come, shake hands, forgive and forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit gave his hand, but gave it rather coldly.  \"I forgive it with all\\r\\nmy heart,\" said he; \"but I cannot forget it so soon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then, you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you\\r\\nwere.  Surely you cannot bear malice, Loveit.\"  Loveit smiled, and\\r\\nallowed that he certainly could not bear malice.  \"Well, then, come; you\\r\\nknow at the bottom we all love you, and would do anything in the world\\r\\nfor you.\"  Poor Loveit, flattered in his foible, began to believe that\\r\\nthey did love him at the bottom, as they said, and even with his eyes\\r\\nopen consented again to be duped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange it is,\" thought he, \"that I should set such value upon the\\r\\nlove of those I despise!  When I\\'m once out of this scrape, I\\'ll have no\\r\\nmore to do with them, I\\'m determined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared with his friend Hardy, his new associates did indeed appear\\r\\ncontemptible; for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform\\r\\nkindness, avoided to pry into his secrets, yet seemed ready to receive\\r\\nhis confidence, if it had been offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter school in the evening, as he was standing silently beside Hardy,\\r\\nwho was ruling a sheet of paper for him, Tarlton, in his brutal manner,\\r\\ncame up, and seizing him by the arm, cried, \"Come along with me, Loveit,\\r\\nI\\'ve something to say to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t come now,\" said Loveit, drawing away his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, do come now,\" said Tarlton, in a voice of persuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but do, pray; there\\'s a good fellow, come now, because I have\\r\\nsomething to say to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you\\'ve got to say to me?  I wish you\\'d let me alone,\" said\\r\\nLoveit; yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper\\r\\nagain; and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings,\\r\\nwent so far as to say, \"Loveit, the other day you wanted a top; I\\'ll give\\r\\nyou mine if you desire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit thanked him, and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this\\r\\ntop.  \"But what did you want to say to me just now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, we\\'ll talk of that presently; not yet--when we get out of hearing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody is near us,\" said Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come a little farther however,\" said Tarlton, looking round\\r\\nsuspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well now, well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know the dog that frightened us last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will never frighten us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t it? how so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said Tarlton, drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a\\r\\nblue handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\"  Tarlton opened it.  \"Raw meat!\" exclaimed Loveit.  \"How\\r\\ncame you by it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tom, the servant boy, Tom got it for me; and I\\'m to give him sixpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is it for the dog?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I vowed I\\'d be revenged on him, and after this he\\'ll never bark\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never bark again!  What do you mean?  Is it poison?\" exclaimed Loveit,\\r\\nstarting back with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only poison for A DOG,\" said Tarlton, confused; \"you could not look more\\r\\nshocking if it was poison for a Christian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence.  \"Tarlton,\" said he\\r\\nat last, in a changed tone and altered manner, \"I did not know you; I\\r\\nwill have no more to do with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but stay,\" said Tarlton, catching hold of his arm, \"stay; I was\\r\\nonly joking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let go my arm--you were in earnest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then that was before I knew there was any harm.  If you think\\r\\nthere\\'s any harm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"IF,\" said Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you know, I might not know; for Tom told me it\\'s a thing that\\'s\\r\\noften done.  Ask Tom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll ask nobody!  Surely we know better what\\'s right and wrong than Tom\\r\\ndoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But only just ask him, to hear what he\\'ll say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear what he\\'ll say,\" cried Loveit, vehemently:  \"the\\r\\ndog will die in agonies--in agonies!  There was a dog poisoned at my\\r\\nfather\\'s--I saw him in the yard.  Poor creature!  He lay and howled and\\r\\nwrithed himself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor creature!  Well, there\\'s no harm done now,\" cried Tarlton, in a\\r\\nhypocritical tone.  But though he thought fit to dissemble with Loveit,\\r\\nhe was thoroughly determined in his purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Loveit, in haste to get away, returned to his friend Hardy; but his\\r\\nmind was in such agitation, that he neither talked nor moved like\\r\\nhimself; and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready\\r\\nto burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good-natured you are to me,\" said he to Hardy, as he was trying\\r\\nvainly to entertain him; \"but if you knew--\"  Here he stopped short, for\\r\\nthe bell for evening prayer rang, and they all took their places, and\\r\\nknelt down.  After prayers, as they were going to bed, Loveit stopped\\r\\nTarlton,--\"WELL!\" asked he, in an inquiring manner, fixing his eyes upon\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WELL!\" replied Tarlton, in an audacious tone, as if he meant to set his\\r\\ninquiring eye at defiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean to do to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To go to sleep, as you do, I suppose,\" replied Tarlton, turning away\\r\\nabruptly, and whistling as he walked off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he has certainly changed his mind!\" said Loveit to himself, \"else he\\r\\ncould not whistle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten minutes after this, as he and Hardy were undressing, Hardy\\r\\nsuddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said he, \"it will be quite spoiled before morning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call Tom,\" said Loveit, \"and bid him bring it in for you in a minute.\"\\r\\nThey both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom; no one answered.\\r\\nThey called again louder, \"Is Tom below?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m here,\" answered he at last, coming out of Tarlton\\'s room with a look\\r\\nof mixed embarrassment and effrontery.  And as he was receiving Hardy\\'s\\r\\ncommission, Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of\\r\\nhis pocket.  This excited fresh suspicions in Loveit\\'s mind; but, without\\r\\nsaying one word, he immediately stationed himself at the window in his\\r\\nroom, which looked out towards the lane; and, as the moon was risen, he\\r\\ncould see if anyone passed that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there?\" said Hardy, after he had been watching some\\r\\ntime; \"why don\\'t you come to bed?\"  Loveit returned no answer, but\\r\\ncontinued standing at the window.  Nor did he watch long in vain.\\r\\nPresently he saw Tom gliding slowly along a by-path, and get over the\\r\\ngate into the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s gone to do it!\" exclaimed Loveit aloud, with an emotion which he\\r\\ncould not command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s gone? to do what?\" cried Hardy, starting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How cruel! how wicked!\" continued Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s cruel--what\\'s wicked? speak out at once!\" returned Hardy, in that\\r\\ncommanding tone which, in moments of danger, strong minds feel themselves\\r\\nentitled to assume towards weak ones.  Loveit instantly, though in an\\r\\nincoherent manner, explained the affair to him.  Scarcely had the words\\r\\npassed his lips, when Hardy sprang up, and began dressing himself without\\r\\nsaying one syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For God\\'s sake, what are you going to do?\" said Loveit, in great\\r\\nanxiety.  \"They\\'ll never forgive me! don\\'t betray me! they\\'ll never\\r\\nforgive! pray, speak to me! only say you won\\'t betray us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not betray you, trust to me,\" said Hardy:  and he left the room,\\r\\nand Loveit stood in amazement; while, in the meantime, Hardy, in hopes of\\r\\novertaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided, ran with all\\r\\npossible speed across the meadow, then down the lane.  He came up with\\r\\nTom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man\\'s garden.  Hardy,\\r\\ntoo much out of breath to speak, seized hold of him, dragged him down,\\r\\ndetaining him with a firm grasp, whilst he panted for utterance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Master Hardy, is it you? what\\'s the matter? what do you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who told you that I had any such thing?\" said Tom, clapping his hand\\r\\nupon his guilty pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give it me quietly, and I\\'ll let you off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, upon my word I haven\\'t!  I didn\\'t!  I don\\'t know what you mean,\"\\r\\nsaid Tom, trembling, though he was by far the stronger of the two.\\r\\n\"Indeed, I don\\'t know what you mean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do,\" said Hardy, with great indignation:  and a violent struggle\\r\\nimmediately commenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog, now alarmed by the voices, began to bark outrageously.  Tom was\\r\\nterrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter;\\r\\nhis strength forsook him, and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the\\r\\nhedge, he ran away with all his speed.  The handkerchief fell within\\r\\nreach of the dog, who instantly snapped at it; luckily it did not come\\r\\nuntied.  Hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him, and,\\r\\nseizing upon it, stuck it into the handkerchief.  The dog pulled, tore,\\r\\ngrowled, grappled, yelled; it was impossible to get the handkerchief from\\r\\nbetween his teeth; but the knot was loosed, the meat, unperceived by the\\r\\ndog, dropped out, and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph,\\r\\nHardy, with inexpressible joy, plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned\\r\\nmeat, and bore it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle.\\r\\nFull of the pleasure of successful benevolence, Hardy tripped joyfully\\r\\nhome, and vaulted over the window sill, when the first object he beheld\\r\\nwas Mr. Power, the usher, standing at the head of the stairs, with his\\r\\ncandle in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come up, whoever you are,\" said Mr. William Power, in a stern voice.  \"I\\r\\nthought I should find you out at last.  Come up, whoever you are!\"  Hardy\\r\\nobeyed without reply.--\"Hardy!\" exclaimed Mr. Power, starting back with\\r\\nastonishment; \"is it you, Mr. Hardy?\" repeated he, holding the light to\\r\\nhis face.  \"Why, sir,\" said he, in a sneering tone, \"I\\'m sure if Mr.\\r\\nTrueman was here he wouldn\\'t believe his own eyes; but for my part I saw\\r\\nthrough you long since; I never liked saints, for my share.  Will you\\r\\nplease to do me the favour, sir, if it is not too much trouble, to empty\\r\\nyour pockets.\"  Hardy obeyed in silence.  \"Heyday! meat! raw meat! what\\r\\nnext?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all,\" said Hardy, emptying his pockets inside out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is ALL,\" said Mr. Power, taking up the meat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, sir,\" said Hardy, eagerly, \"let that meat be burned, it is\\r\\npoisoned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poisoned!\" cried Mr. William Power, letting it drop out of his fingers;\\r\\n\"you wretch!\" looking at him with a menacing air:  \"what is all this?\\r\\nSpeak.\"  Hardy was silent.  \"Why don\\'t you speak?\" cried he, shaking him\\r\\nby the shoulder impatiently.  Still Hardy was silent.  \"Down upon your\\r\\nknees this minute and confess all:  tell me where you\\'ve been, what\\r\\nyou\\'ve been doing, and who are your accomplices, for I know there is a\\r\\ngang of you; so,\" added he, pressing heavily upon Hardy\\'s shoulder, \"down\\r\\nupon your knees this minute, and confess the whole, that\\'s your only way\\r\\nnow to get off yourself.  If you hope for MY pardon, I can tell you it\\'s\\r\\nnot to be had without asking for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Hardy, in a firm but respectful voice, \"I have no pardon to\\r\\nask, I have nothing to confess; I am innocent; but if I were not, I would\\r\\nnever try to get off myself by betraying my companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir! very well! very fine! stick to it, stick to it, I advise\\r\\nyou, and we shall see.  And how will you look to-morrow, Mr. Innocent,\\r\\nwhen my uncle, the doctor, comes home?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I do now, sir,\" said Hardy, unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis composure threw Mr. Power into a rage too great for utterance.\\r\\n\"Sir,\" continued Hardy, \"ever since I have been at school, I never told a\\r\\nlie, and therefore, sir, I hope you will believe me now.  Upon my word\\r\\nand honour, sir, I have done nothing wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing wrong?  Better and better! what, when I caught you going out at\\r\\nnight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT, to be sure, was wrong,\" said Hardy, recollecting himself; \"but\\r\\nexcept that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except that, sir! I will except nothing.  Come along with me, young\\r\\ngentleman, your time for pardon is past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to a small\\r\\ncloset, set apart for desperate offenders, and usually known by the name\\r\\nof the BLACK HOLE.  \"There, sir, take up your lodging there for to-\\r\\nnight,\" said he, pushing him in; \"tomorrow I\\'ll know more, or I\\'ll know\\r\\nwhy,\" added he, double locking the door, with a tremendous noise, upon\\r\\nhis prisoner, and locking also the door at the end of the passage, so\\r\\nthat no one could have access to him.  \"So now I think I have you safe!\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. William Power to himself, stalking off with steps which made the\\r\\nwhole gallery resound, and which made many a guilty heart tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr. Power at the head\\r\\nof the stairs had been anxiously listened to; but only a word or two here\\r\\nand there had been distinctly overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound--some knew not\\r\\nwhat it portended, and others knew TOO WELL.  All assembled in the\\r\\nmorning with faces of anxiety.  Tarlton and Loveit\\'s were the most\\r\\nagitated:  Tarlton for himself, Loveit for his friend, for himself, for\\r\\neverybody.  Every one of the party, and Tarlton at their head, surrounded\\r\\nhim with reproaches; and considered him as the author of the evils which\\r\\nhung over them.  \"How could you do so? and why did you say anything to\\r\\nHardy about it? when you had promised, too!  Oh! what shall we all do?\\r\\nwhat a scrape you have brought us into, Loveit, it\\'s all your fault!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ALL MY FAULT!\" repeated poor Loveit, with a sigh; \"well, that is hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goodness! there\\'s the bell,\" exclaimed a number of voices at once.  \"Now\\r\\nfor it!\"  They all stood in a half circle for morning prayers.  They\\r\\nlistened--\"Here he is coming!  No--Yes--Here he is!\"  And Mr. William\\r\\nPower, with a gloomy brow, appeared and walked up to his place at the\\r\\nhead of the room.  They knelt down to prayers, and the moment they rose,\\r\\nMr. William Power, laying his hand upon the table, cried, \"Stand still,\\r\\ngentlemen, if you please.\"  Everybody stood stock still; he walked out of\\r\\nthe circle; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy, and the whole room\\r\\nwas in commotion.  Each with eagerness asked each what none could answer,\\r\\n\"HAS HE TOLD?\"  \"WHAT has he told?\"  \"Who has he told of?\"  \"I hope he\\r\\nhas not told of me,\" cried they.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll answer for it he has told of all of us,\" said Tarlton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'ll answer for it he has told of none of us,\" answered Loveit, with\\r\\na sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think he\\'s such a fool, when he can get himself off,\" said\\r\\nTarlton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the prisoner was led in, and as he passed through the\\r\\ncircle, every eye was fixed upon him.  His eye fell upon no one, not even\\r\\nupon Loveit, who pulled him by the coat as he passed--everyone felt\\r\\nalmost afraid to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Power, sitting down in Mr. Trueman\\'s elbow-chair,\\r\\nand placing the prisoner opposite to him; \"well, sir, what have you to\\r\\nsay to me this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir,\" answered Hardy, in a decided, yet modest manner; \"nothing\\r\\nbut what I said last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have something more to say to you, sir, then; and a great deal\\r\\nmore, I promise you, before I have done with you;\" and then, seizing him\\r\\nin a fury, he was just going to give him a severe flogging, when the\\r\\nschoolroom door opened, and Mr. Trueman appeared, followed by an old man\\r\\nwhom Loveit immediately knew.  He leaned upon his stick as he walked, and\\r\\nin his other hand carried a basket of apples.  When they came within the\\r\\ncircle, Mr. Trueman stopped short.  \"Hardy!\" exclaimed he, with a voice\\r\\nof unfeigned surprise, whilst Mr. William Power stood with his hand\\r\\nsuspended.--\"Ay, Hardy, sir,\" repeated he.  \"I told him you\\'d not believe\\r\\nyour own eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trueman advanced with a slow step.  \"Now, sir, give me leave,\" said\\r\\nthe usher, eagerly drawing him aside, and whispering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, sir,\" said Mr. T. when the whisper was done, addressing himself to\\r\\nHardy, with a voice and manner which, had he been guilty, must have\\r\\npierced him to the heart, \"I find I have been deceived in you; it is but\\r\\nthree hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in\\r\\nwhom I placed so much confidence; but, after all this show of honour and\\r\\nintegrity, the moment my back is turned, you are the first to set an\\r\\nexample of disobedience of my orders.  Why do I talk of disobeying my\\r\\ncommands--you are a thief!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I, sir?\" exclaimed Hardy, no longer able to repress his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, sir,--you and some others,\" said Mr. Trueman, looking round the\\r\\nroom with a penetrating glance--\"you and some others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, sir,\" interrupted Mr. William Power, \"get that out of him if you\\r\\ncan--ask him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will ask him nothing; I shall neither put his truth nor his honour to\\r\\nthe trial; truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not a thief!  I have never had anything to do with thieves,\" cried\\r\\nHardy, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you not robbed this old man?  Don\\'t you know the taste of these\\r\\napples?\" said Mr. Trueman, taking one out of the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; I do not.  I never touched one of that old man\\'s apples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never touched one of them!  I suppose this is some vile equivocation;\\r\\nyou have done worse, you have had the barbarity, the baseness, to attempt\\r\\nto poison his dog; the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last\\r\\nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The poisoned meat was found in my pocket, sir; but I never intended to\\r\\npoison the dog--I saved his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless him!\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense--cunning!\" said Mr. Power.  \"I hope you won\\'t let him impose\\r\\nupon you, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he cannot impose upon me; I have a proof he is little prepared for,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Trueman, producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had\\r\\nbeen wrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarlton turned pale; Hardy\\'s countenance never changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know this handkerchief, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it not yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know whose it is?\" cried Mr. Power.  Hardy was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Trueman, \"I am not fond of punishing you; but\\r\\nwhen I do it, you know, it is always in earnest.  I will begin with the\\r\\neldest of you; I will begin with Hardy, and flog you with my own hands\\r\\ntill this handkerchief is owned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure it\\'s not mine,\" and \"I\\'m sure it\\'s none of mine,\" burst from\\r\\nevery mouth, whilst they looked at each other in dismay; for none but\\r\\nHardy, Loveit and Tarlton knew the secret.  \"My cane,\" said Mr. Trueman,\\r\\nand Mr. Power handed him the cane.  Loveit groaned from the bottom of his\\r\\nheart.  Tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance.\\r\\nHardy looked with a steady eye at the cane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But first,\" said Mr. Trueman, laying down the cane, \"let us see.\\r\\nPerhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way,\"\\r\\nexamining the corners.  It was torn almost to pieces; but luckily the\\r\\ncorner that was marked remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"J. T.!\" cried Mr. Trueman.  Every eye turned upon the guilty Tarlton,\\r\\nwho, now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb, sank down upon his\\r\\nknees, and in a whining voice begged for mercy.  \"Upon my word and\\r\\nhonour, sir, I\\'ll tell you all; I\\'d never have thought of stealing the\\r\\napples if Loveit had not first told me of them; and it was Tom who first\\r\\nput the poisoning the dog into my head.  It was he that carried the meat,\\r\\nWASN\\'T IT?\" said he, appealing to Hardy, whose word he knew must be\\r\\nbelieved.  \"Oh, dear sir!\" continued he as Mr. Trueman began to move\\r\\ntowards him, \"do let me off; pray do let me off this time!  I\\'m not the\\r\\nonly one, indeed, sir! I hope you won\\'t make me an example for the rest.\\r\\nIt\\'s very hard I\\'m to be flogged more than they!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not going to flog you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tarlton, getting up and wiping his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not thank me,\" said Mr. Trueman.  \"Take your handkerchief--go\\r\\nout of this room--out of this house; let me never see you more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had any hopes of him,\" said Mr. Trueman, as he shut the door after\\r\\nhim;--\"if I had any hopes of him, I would have punished him;--but I have\\r\\nnone.  Punishment is meant only to make people better; and those who have\\r\\nany hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words Loveit first, and immediately all the rest of the guilty\\r\\nparty, stepped out of the ranks, confessed their fault, and declared\\r\\nthemselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they have been punished enough,\" said the old man; \"forgive them,\\r\\nsir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy looked as if he wished to speak.  \"Not because you ask it,\" said\\r\\nMr. Trueman to the guilty penitents, \"though I should be glad to oblige\\r\\nyou--it wouldn\\'t be just; but there,\" pointing to Hardy, \"there is one\\r\\nwho has merited a reward; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning\\r\\nhis companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure, whilst everybody present\\r\\nsympathized in his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" thought Loveit, \"this is a lesson I shall never forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the old man, with a faltering voice, \"it wasn\\'t for the\\r\\nsake of my apples that I spoke; and you, sir,\" said he to Hardy, \"I thank\\r\\nyou for saving my dog.  If you please, I\\'ll plant on that mount, opposite\\r\\nthe window, a young apple-tree, from my old one.  I will water it, and\\r\\ntake care of it with my own hands for your sake, as long as I am able.\\r\\nAnd may God bless you!\" laying his trembling hand on Hardy\\'s head; \"may\\r\\nGod bless you--I\\'m sure God WILL bless all such boys as you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BASKET-WOMAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Toute leur etude etait de se complaire et de s\\'entr\\'aider.\" *\\r\\n                                              PAUL ET VIRGINIE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foot of a steep, slippery, white hill, near Dunstable, in\\r\\nBedfordshire, called Chalk Hill, there is a hut, or rather a hovel, which\\r\\ntravellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited, if they did not see\\r\\nthe smoke rising from its peaked roof.  An old woman lives in this hovel,\\r\\n** and with her a little boy and girl, the children of a beggar who died,\\r\\nand left these orphans perishing with hunger.  They thought themselves\\r\\nvery happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid\\r\\nthem warm themselves at her small fire, and gave them a crust of mouldy\\r\\nbread to eat.  She had not much to give, but what she had she gave with\\r\\ngood-will.  She was very kind to these poor children, and worked hard at\\r\\nher spinning-wheel and at her knitting, to support herself and them.  She\\r\\nearned money also in another way.  She used to follow all the carriages\\r\\nas they went up Chalk Hill, and when the horses stopped to take breath or\\r\\nto rest themselves, she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent\\r\\nthem from rolling backwards down the steep, slippery hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n* \"Their whole study was how to please and to help one another.\"\\r\\n** This was about the close of the 18th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old\\r\\nwoman\\'s spinning-wheel when she was spinning, and to talk to her.  At\\r\\nthese times she taught them something, which, she said, she hoped they\\r\\nwould remember all their lives.  She explained to them what is meant by\\r\\ntelling the truth, and what it is to be honest.  She taught them to\\r\\ndislike idleness, and to wish that they could be useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as they were standing beside her, the little boy said to\\r\\nher, \"Grandmother,\" for that was the name by which she liked that these\\r\\nchildren should call her--\"grandmother, how often you are forced to get\\r\\nup from your spinning-wheel, and to follow the chaises and coaches up\\r\\nthat steep hill, to put stones underneath the wheels, to hinder them from\\r\\nrolling back!  The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny\\r\\nor a penny for doing this, don\\'t they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill.  You often\\r\\nsay that you are tired, and then you know that you cannot spin all that\\r\\ntime.  Now if we might go up the hill, and put the stones behind the\\r\\nwheels, you could sit still at your work, and would not the people give\\r\\nus the halfpence? and could not we bring them all to you?  Do, pray, dear\\r\\ngrandmother, try us for one day--to-morrow, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman; \"I will try what you can do; but I must go up\\r\\nthe hill along with you for the first two or three times, for fear you\\r\\nshould get yourselves hurt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the next day, the little boy and girl went with their grandmother, as\\r\\nthey used to call her, up the steep hill; and she showed the boy how to\\r\\nprevent the wheels from rolling back, by putting stones behind them; and\\r\\nshe said, \"This is called scotching the wheels;\" and she took off the\\r\\nboy\\'s hat and gave it to the little girl, to hold up to the carriage-\\r\\nwindows, ready for the halfpence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves, she\\r\\nleft them, and returned to her spinning-wheel.  A great many carriages\\r\\nhappened to go by this day, and the little girl received a great many\\r\\nhalfpence.  She carried them all in her brother\\'s hat to her grandmother\\r\\nin the evening; and the old woman smiled, and thanked the children.  She\\r\\nsaid that they had been useful to her, and that her spinning had gone on\\r\\nfinely, because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day.\\r\\n\"But, Paul my boy,\" said she, \"what is the matter with your hand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a pinch--only one pinch that I got, as I was putting a stone behind\\r\\na wheel of a chaise.  It does not hurt me much, grandmother; and I\\'ve\\r\\nthought of a good thing for to-morrow.  I shall never be hurt again, if\\r\\nyou will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken\\r\\ncrutch, grandmother, and the block of wood that lies in the chimney-\\r\\ncorner, and that is of no use.  I\\'ll make it of some use, if I may have\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take it then, dear,\" said the old woman; \"and you\\'ll find the handle of\\r\\nthe broken crutch under my bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul went to work immediately, and fastened one end of the pole into the\\r\\nblock of wood, so as to make something like a dry-rubbing brush.  \"Look,\\r\\ngrandmamma, look at my SCOTCHER.  I call this thing my SCOTCHER,\" said\\r\\nPaul, \"because I shall always scotch the wheels with it.  I shall never\\r\\npinch my fingers again; my hands, you see, will be safe at the end of\\r\\nthis long stick; and, sister Anne, you need not be at the trouble of\\r\\ncarrying any more stones after me up the hill; we shall never want stones\\r\\nany more.  My scotcher will do without anything else, I hope.  I wish it\\r\\nwas morning, and that a carriage would come, that I might run up the\\r\\nhill, and try my scotcher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish that as many chaises may go by to-morrow as there did to-day,\\r\\nand that we may bring you as many halfpence, grandmother,\" said the\\r\\nlittle girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I, my dear Anne,\" said the old woman; \"for I mean that you and\\r\\nyour brother shall have all the money that you get to-morrow.  You may\\r\\nbuy some gingerbread for yourselves, or some of those ripe plums that you\\r\\nsaw at the fruit-stall the other day, which is just going into Dunstable.\\r\\nI told you then that I could not afford to buy such things for you; but\\r\\nnow that you can earn halfpence for yourselves, children, it is fair\\r\\nshould taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in\\r\\nyour lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll bring some of the gingerbread home to her, shan\\'t we, brother?\"\\r\\nwhispered little Anne.  The morning came;  but no carriages were heard,\\r\\nthough Paul and his sister had risen at five o\\'clock, that they might be\\r\\nsure to be ready for early travellers.  Paul kept his scotcher poised\\r\\nupon his shoulder, and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of\\r\\nthe hill.  He did not wait long before a carriage came.  He followed it\\r\\nup the hill; and the instant the postillion called to him, and bid him\\r\\nstop the wheels, he put his scotcher behind them, and found that it\\r\\nanswered the purpose perfectly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany carriages went by this day, and Paul and Anne received a great many\\r\\nhalfpence from the travellers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it grew dusk in the evening, Anne said to her brother--\"I don\\'t\\r\\nthink any more carriages will come by to-day.  Let us count the\\r\\nhalfpence, and carry them home now to grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not yet,\" answered Paul, \"let them alone--let them lie still in the\\r\\nhole where I have put them.  I daresay more carriages will come by before\\r\\nit is quite dark, and then we shall have more halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul had taken the halfpence out of his hat, and he had put them into a\\r\\nhole in the high bank by the roadside; and Anne said she would not meddle\\r\\nwith them, and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them;\\r\\nand Paul said--\"If you will stay and watch here, I will go and gather\\r\\nsome blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field.  Stand you\\r\\nhereabouts, half-way up the hill, and the moment you see any carriage\\r\\ncoming along the road, run as fast as you can and call me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne waited a long time, or what she thought a long time; and she saw no\\r\\ncarriage, and she trailed her brother\\'s scotcher up and down till she was\\r\\ntired.  Then she stood still, and looked again, and she saw no carriage;\\r\\nso she went sorrowfully into the field, and to the hedge where her\\r\\nbrother was gathering blackberries, and she said, \"Paul, I\\'m sadly tired,\\r\\nSADLY TIRED!\" said she, \"and my eyes are quite strained with looking for\\r\\nchaises; no more chaises will come to-night; and your scotcher is lying\\r\\nthere, of no use, upon the ground.  Have not I waited long enough for to-\\r\\nday, Paul?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Paul; \"here are some blackberries for you; you had better\\r\\nwait a little bit longer.  Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are\\r\\nstanding here talking to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, who was of a very obliging temper, and who liked to do what she was\\r\\nasked to do, went back to the place where the scotcher lay; and scarcely\\r\\nhad she reached the spot, when she heard the noise of a carriage.  She\\r\\nran to call her brother, and to their great joy, they now saw four\\r\\nchaises coming towards them.  Paul, as soon as they went up the hill,\\r\\nfollowed with his scotcher; first he scotched the wheels of one carriage,\\r\\nthen of another; and Anne was so much delighted with observing how well\\r\\nthe scotcher stopped the wheels, and how much better it was than stones,\\r\\nthat she forgot to go and hold her brother\\'s hat to the travellers for\\r\\nhalfpence, till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl, who\\r\\nwas looking out of the window of one of the chaises.  \"Come close to the\\r\\nchaise-door,\" said the little girl; \"here are some halfpence for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne held the hat; and she afterwards went on to the other carriages.\\r\\nMoney was thrown to her from each of them; and when they had all gotten\\r\\nsafely to the top of the hill, she and her brother sat down upon a large\\r\\nstone by the roadside, to count their treasure.  First they began by\\r\\ncounting what was in the hat--\"One, two, three, four halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, oh, brother, look at this!\" exclaimed Anne; \"this is not the same\\r\\nas the other halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, it is not,\" cried Paul, \"it is no halfpenny; it is a guinea,\\r\\na bright golden guinea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it?\" said Anne, who had never seen a guinea in her life before, and\\r\\nwho did not know its value; \"and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy\\r\\ngingerbread?  I\\'ll run to the fruit-stall, and ask the woman; shall I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said Paul, \"you need not ask any woman, or anybody but me; I\\r\\ncan tell you all about it, as well as anybody in the whole world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole world!  Oh, Paul, you forgot.  Not so well as my grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, not so well as my grandmother, perhaps, but, Anne, I can tell you\\r\\nthat you must not talk yourself, Anne, but you must listen to me quietly,\\r\\nor else you won\\'t understand what I am going to tell you, for I can\\r\\nassure you that I don\\'t think I quite understood it myself, Anne, the\\r\\nfirst time my grandmother told it to me, though I stood stock still\\r\\nlistening my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be\\r\\nunderstood, Anne looked very grave, and her brother explained to her,\\r\\nthat, with a guinea, she might buy two hundred and fifty-two times as\\r\\nmany plums as she could get for a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Paul, you know the fruit-woman said she would give us a dozen plums\\r\\nfor a penny.  Now, for this little guinea, would she give us two hundred\\r\\nand fifty-two dozen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If she has so many, and if we like to have so many, to be sure she\\r\\nwill,\" said Paul, \"but I think we should not like to have two hundred and\\r\\nfifty-two dozen of plums; we could not eat such a number.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we could give some of them to my grandmother,\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But still there would be too many for her, and for us, too,\" said Paul,\\r\\n\"and when we had eaten the plums, there would be an end to all the\\r\\npleasure.  But now I\\'ll tell you what I am thinking of, Anne, that we\\r\\nmight buy something for my grandmother, that would be very useful to her\\r\\nindeed, with the guinea--something that would last a great while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, brother?  What sort of thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something that she said she wanted very much last winter, when she was\\r\\nso ill with the rheumatism--something that she said yesterday, when you\\r\\nwere making her bed, she wished she might be able to buy before next\\r\\nwinter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, I know what you mean!\" said Anne--\"a blanket.  Oh, yes, Paul,\\r\\nthat will be much better than plums; do let us buy a blanket for her; how\\r\\nglad she will be to see it!  I will make her bed with the new blanket,\\r\\nand then bring her to see it.  But, Paul, how shall we buy a blanket?\\r\\nWhere are blankets to be got?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave that to me, I\\'ll manage that.  I know where blankets can be got.\\r\\nI saw one hanging out of a shop the day I went last to Dunstable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen a great many things at Dunstable, brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a great many; but I never saw anything there or anywhere else, that\\r\\nI wished for half so much as I did for the blanket for my grandmother.\\r\\nDo you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter?  I\\'ll\\r\\nbuy the blanket to-morrow.  I\\'m going to Dunstable with her spinning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you\\'ll bring the blanket to me, and I shall make the bed very\\r\\nneatly, that will be all right--all happy!\" said Anne, clapping her\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay!  Hush! don\\'t clap your hands so, Anne; it will not be all\\r\\nhappy, I\\'m afraid,\" said Paul, and his countenance changed, and he looked\\r\\nvery grave.  \"It will not be all right, I\\'m afraid, for there is one\\r\\nthing we have neither of us thought of, but that we ought to think about.\\r\\nWe cannot buy the blanket, I\\'m afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Paul, why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I don\\'t think this guinea is honestly ours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, brother, but I\\'m sure it is honestly ours.  It was given to us, and\\r\\ngrandmother said all that was given to us to-day was to be our own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But who gave it to you, Anne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of the people in those chaises, Paul.  I don\\'t know which of them,\\r\\nbut I daresay it was the little rosy girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"for when she called you to the chaise door, she said,\\r\\n\\'Here\\'s some halfpence for you.\\'  Now, if she gave you the guinea, she\\r\\nmust have given it to you by mistake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me,\\r\\nand did not give it to me by mistake, Paul.  There was a gentleman\\r\\nreading in one of the chaises and a lady, who looked very good-naturedly\\r\\nat me, and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of\\r\\nthe window, and looked at your scotcher, brother, and he asked me if that\\r\\nwas your own making; and when I said yes, and that I was your sister he\\r\\nsmiled at me, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and threw a\\r\\nhandful of halfpence into the hat, and I daresay he gave us the guinea\\r\\nalong with them because he liked your scotcher so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Paul, \"that might be, to be sure, but I wish I was quite\\r\\ncertain of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, as we are not quite certain, had not we best go and ask my\\r\\ngrandmother what she thinks about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul thought this was excellent advice; and he was not a silly boy, who\\r\\ndid not like to follow good advice.  He went with his sister directly to\\r\\nhis grandmother, showed her the guinea, and told her how they came by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, honest children,\" said she, \"I am very glad you told me all\\r\\nthis.  I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the\\r\\nblanket with this guinea.  I\\'m sure it is not honestly ours.  Those who\\r\\nthrew it you gave it you by mistake, I warrant; and what I would have you\\r\\ndo is, to go to Dunstable, and try if you can, at either of the inns find\\r\\nout the person who gave it to you.  It is now so late in the evening that\\r\\nperhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable, instead of going on the\\r\\nnext stage; and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of\\r\\na halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time.  All you can do is\\r\\nto go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Paul, \"I know a good way of finding him out.  I\\r\\nremember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels:  and I remember I\\r\\nread the innkeeper\\'s name upon the chaise, \\'John Nelson.\\'  (I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for teaching me to read, grandmother.)  You told me\\r\\nyesterday, grandmother, that the names written upon chaises are the\\r\\ninnkeepers to whom they belong.  I read the name of the innkeeper upon\\r\\nthat chaise.  It was John Nelson.  So Anne and I will go to both the inns\\r\\nin Dunstable, and try to find out this chaise--John Nelson\\'s.  Come,\\r\\nAnne; let us set out before it gets quite dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that\\r\\nwas covered with gingerbread and ripe plums, and pursued their way\\r\\nsteadily through the streets of Dunstable; but Paul, when he came to the\\r\\nshop where he had seen the blanket, stopped for a moment, and said,  \"It\\r\\nis a great pity, Anne, that the guinea is not ours.  However, we are\\r\\ndoing what is honest, and that is a comfort.  Here, we must go through\\r\\nthis gateway, into the inn-yard; we are come to the \\'Dun Cow.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cow!\" said Anne, \"I see no cow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look up, and you\\'ll see the cow over your head,\" said Paul--\"the sign--\\r\\nthe picture.  Come, never mind looking at it now; I want to find out the\\r\\ngreen chaise that has John Nelson\\'s name upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul pushed forward, through a crowded passage, till he got into the inn-\\r\\nyard.  There was a great noise and bustle.  The hostlers were carrying in\\r\\nluggage.  The postillions were rubbing down the horses, or rolling the\\r\\nchaises into the coach-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What now!  What business have you here, pray?\" said a waiter, who almost\\r\\nran over Paul, as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some\\r\\nempty bottles from the bottle-rack.  \"You\\'ve no business here, crowding\\r\\nup the yard.  Walk off, young gentleman, if you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray give me leave, sir,\" said Paul, \"to stay a few minutes, to look\\r\\namongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels, that has\\r\\nMr. John Nelson\\'s name written upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that he says about a dark green chaise?\" said one of the\\r\\npostillions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should such a one as he is know about chaises?\" interrupted the\\r\\nhasty waiter, and he vas going to turn Paul out of the yard; but the\\r\\nhostler caught hold of his arm and said, \"Maybe the child has some\\r\\nbusiness here; let\\'s know what he has to say for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend\\r\\nthe bell; and Paul told his business to the hostler, who as soon as he\\r\\nsaw the guinea and heard the story, shook Paul by the hand, and said,\\r\\n\"Stand steady, my honest lad; I\\'ll find the chaise for you, if it is to\\r\\nbe found here; but John Nelson\\'s chaises almost always drive to the\\r\\n\\'Black Bull.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some difficulty, the green chaise, with John Nelson\\'s name upon it,\\r\\nand the postillion who drove that chaise, were found; and the postillion\\r\\ntold Paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had\\r\\ndriven, to be paid, and that he would carry the guinea with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"we should like to give it back ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the hostler; \"that they have a right to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postillion made no reply, but looked vexed, and went towards the\\r\\nhouse, desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return.\\r\\nIn the passage there was standing a decent, clean, good natured looking\\r\\nwoman, with two huge straw baskets on each side of her.  One of the\\r\\nbaskets stood a little in the way of the entrance.  A man who was pushing\\r\\nhis way in, and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a\\r\\npole, impatient at being stopped, kicked down the straw basket, and all\\r\\nits contents were thrown out.  Bright straw hats, and boxes, and\\r\\nslippers, were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they will be trampled upon!  They will be all spoiled!\" exclaimed\\r\\nthe woman to whom they belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll help you to pick them up if you will let us,\" cried Paul and Anne;\\r\\nand they immediately ran to her assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the things were all safe in the basket again, the children expressed\\r\\na desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw; but\\r\\nthe woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the\\r\\nparlour, and with him a gentleman\\'s servant, who came to Paul, and\\r\\nclapping him upon the back, said, \"So, my little chap, I gave you a\\r\\nguinea for a halfpenny, I hear; and I understand you\\'ve brought it back\\r\\nagain; that\\'s right, give me hold of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, brother,\" said Anne, \"this is not the gentleman that was reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh, child, I came in Mr. Nelson\\'s green chaise.  Here\\'s the postillion\\r\\ncan tell you so.  I and my master came in that chaise.  I and my master\\r\\nthat was reading, as you say, and it was he that threw the money out to\\r\\nyou.  He is going to bed; he is tired and can\\'t see you himself.  He\\r\\ndesires that you\\'ll give me the guinea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pushed them towards the door; but the basket-woman whispered to them\\r\\nas they went out, \"Wait in the street till I come to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Mrs. Landlady,\" cried this gentleman\\'s servant, addressing himself\\r\\nto the landlady, who just then came out of a room where some company were\\r\\nat supper, \"Pray, Mrs. Landlady, please to let me have roasted larks for\\r\\nmy supper.  You are famous for larks at Dunstable; and I make it a rule\\r\\nto taste the best of everything wherever I go; and, waiter, let me have a\\r\\nbottle of claret.  Do you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Larks and claret for his supper,\" said the basket-woman to herself, as\\r\\nshe looked at him from head to foot.  The postillion was still waiting,\\r\\nas if to speak to him; and she observed them afterwards whispering and\\r\\nlaughing together.  \"NO BAD HIT,\" was a sentence which the servant\\r\\npronounced several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it occurred to the basket-woman that this man had cheated the\\r\\nchildren out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret; and she\\r\\nthought that perhaps she could discover the truth.  She waited quietly in\\r\\nthe passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waiter! Joe! Joe!\" cried the landlady, \"why don\\'t you carry in the\\r\\nsweetmeat-puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coming, ma\\'am,\" answered the waiter; and with a large dish of tarts and\\r\\npuffs, the waiter came from the bar; the landlady threw open the door of\\r\\nthe best parlour, to let him in; and the basket-woman had now a full view\\r\\nof a large cheerful company, and amongst them several children, sitting\\r\\nround a supper-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" whispered the landlady, as the door closed after the waiter and the\\r\\ntarts, \"there are customers enough, I warrant, for you in that room, if\\r\\nyou had but the luck to be called in.  Pray, what would you have the\\r\\nconscience, I wonder now, to charge me for these here half-dozen little\\r\\nmats to put under my dishes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A trifle, ma\\'am,\" said the basket-woman.  She let the landlady have the\\r\\nmats cheap, and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if\\r\\nthe company in the best parlour had done supper.  \"When they come to\\r\\ntheir wine,\" added she, \"I\\'ll speak a good word for you, and get you\\r\\ncalled in afore the children are sent to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady, after the usual speech of, \"I hope the supper and\\r\\neverything is to your liking, ladies and gentlemen,\" began with, \"If any\\r\\nof the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR\\'OSITY to see any of our\\r\\nfamous Dunstable straw-work, there\\'s a decent body without would, I\\r\\ndaresay, be proud to show them her pincushion-boxes, and her baskets and\\r\\nslippers, and her other CUR\\'OSITIES.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of the children all turned towards their mother; their mother\\r\\nsmiled, and immediately their father called in the basket-woman, and\\r\\ndesired her to produce her CURIOSITIES.  The children gathered round her\\r\\nlarge pannier as it opened, but they did not touch any of her things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, papa!\" cried a little rosy girl, \"here are a pair of straw slippers\\r\\nthat would just fit you, I think; but would not straw shoes wear out very\\r\\nsoon? and would not they let in the wet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said her father, \"but these slippers are meant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For powdering-slippers, miss,\" interrupted the basket-woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To wear when people are powdering their hair,\" continued the gentleman,\\r\\n\"that they may not spoil their other shoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you buy them, papa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I cannot indulge myself,\" said her father, \"in buying them now.  I\\r\\nmust make amends,\" said he, laughing, \"for my carelessness; and as I\\r\\nthrew away a guinea to-day, I must endeavour to save sixpence at least?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl\\'s hat as\\r\\nwe were coming up Chalk Hill.  Mamma, I wonder that the little girl did\\r\\nnot take notice of its being a guinea, and that she did not run after the\\r\\nchaise to give it back again.  I should think, if she had been an honest\\r\\ngirl, she would have returned it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss!--ma\\'am!--sir!\" said the basket-woman, \"if it would not be\\r\\nimpertinent, may I speak a word?  A little boy and girl have just been\\r\\nhere inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a\\r\\nhalfpenny by mistake; and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the\\r\\nguinea to a gentleman\\'s servant, who is there without, and who said his\\r\\nmaster desired it should be returned to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be some mistake, or some trick in this,\" said the gentleman.\\r\\n\"Are the children gone?  I must see them--send after them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go for them myself,\" said the good natured basket-woman; \"I bid\\r\\nthem wait in the street yonder, for my mind misgave me that the man who\\r\\nspoke so short to them was a cheat, with his larks and his claret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul and Anne were speedily summoned, and brought back by their friend\\r\\nthe basket-woman; and Anne, the moment she saw the gentleman, knew that\\r\\nhe was the very person who smiled upon her, who admired her brother\\'s\\r\\nscotcher, and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat; but she\\r\\ncould not be certain, she said, that she received the guinea from him;\\r\\nshe only thought it most likely that she did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no,\"\\r\\nsaid the gentleman.  \"I marked the guinea; it was a light one; the only\\r\\nguinea I had, which I put into my waistcoat pocket this morning.\"  He\\r\\nrang the bell, and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the\\r\\nroom opposite to him know that he wished to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gentleman in the white parlour, sir, do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a Mr. Pembroke, sir,\" said the waiter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pembroke came; and as soon as he heard what had happened, he desired\\r\\nthe waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper.  The\\r\\ndishonest servant, who was supping upon larks and claret, knew nothing of\\r\\nwhat was going on; but his knife and fork dropped from his hand, and he\\r\\noverturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table, in great\\r\\nsurprise and terror, when his master came in with a face of indignation,\\r\\nand demanded \"THE GUINEA--the GUINEA, sir! that you got from this child;\\r\\nthat guinea which you said I ordered you to ask for from this child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant, confounded and half intoxicated, could only stammer out that\\r\\nhe had more guineas than one about him, and that he really did not know\\r\\nwhich it was.  He pulled his money out, and spread it upon the table with\\r\\ntrembling hands.  The marked guinea appeared.  His master instantly\\r\\nturned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now, my little honest girl,\" said the gentleman who had admired her\\r\\nbrother\\'s scotcher, turning to Anne, \"and now tell me who you are, and\\r\\nwhat you and your brother want or wish for most in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same moment Anne and Paul exclaimed, \"The thing we wish for the\\r\\nmost in the world is a blanket for our grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is not our grandmother in reality, I believe, sir,\" said Paul; \"but\\r\\nshe is just as good to us, and taught me to read, and taught Anne to\\r\\nknit, and taught us both that we should be honest--so she has; and I wish\\r\\nshe had a new blanket before next winter, to keep her from the cold and\\r\\nthe rheumatism.  She had the rheumatism sadly last winter, sir; and there\\r\\nis a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She shall have it, then; and,\" continued the gentleman, \"I will do\\r\\nsomething more for you.  Do you like to be employed or to be idle best?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We like to have something to do always, if we could, sir,\" said Paul;\\r\\n\"but we are forced to be idle sometimes, because grandmother has not\\r\\nalways things for us to do that we CAN do well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you like to learn how to make such baskets as these?\" said the\\r\\ngentleman, pointing to one of the Dunstable straw-baskets.  \"Oh, very\\r\\nmuch!\" said Paul.  \"Very much!\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I should like to teach you how to make them,\" said the basket-\\r\\nwoman; \"for I\\'m sure of one thing, that you\\'d behave honestly to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman put a guinea into the good natured basket-woman\\'s hand, and\\r\\ntold her that he knew she could not afford to teach them her trade for\\r\\nnothing.  \"I shall come through Dunstable again in a few months,\" added\\r\\nhe; \"and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well.  If\\r\\nI find that they are, I will do something more for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Anne, \"we must tell all this to grandmother, and ask her\\r\\nabout it; and I\\'m afraid--though I\\'m very happy--that it is getting very\\r\\nlate, and that we should not stay here any longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a fine moonlight night,\" said the basket-woman; \"and is not far.\\r\\nI\\'ll walk with you, and see you safe home myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman detained them a few minutes longer, till a messenger whom\\r\\nhe had dispatched to purchase the much wished for blanket returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket, I hope,\" said\\r\\nthe gentleman, as he gave it into Paul\\'s opened arms.  \"It has been\\r\\nobtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n']"
